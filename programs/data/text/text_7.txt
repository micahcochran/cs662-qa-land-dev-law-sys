SECTION 305 CONDITIONAL USES 305.1 General. The principal objective of this zoning code is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible build- ings and land uses, and for the property location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various use districts established by this code. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each dis- trict, there are certain additional uses which it may be neces- sary to allow because of the unusual characteristics of the service they provide the public. These conditional uses require particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, established or intended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and operation of such special uses are established by the applicable sections of this code. 13  14 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  uses shall be: SECTION 401 AGRICULTURAL ZONES DEFINED 401.1 Agricultural zone.
