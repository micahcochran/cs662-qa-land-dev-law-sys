The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.1  Amended 08-10-21 ARTICLE 10. OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS Section 1000. Planned Unit Developments. The purpose of planned unit developments is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. The City gains the advantages of variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plan by the Sugar Hill Planning and Zoning Commission provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. The planned unit development is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. The planned unit development is, furthermore, not intended to enhance the value of the property for speculative purposes. Approval of a planned unit development is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one (1) year, and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the Mayor and City Council may, upon written notice to the property owner, abolish the Zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of actual development. A. Types of Planned Unit Development. The following types of planned unit developments are authorized by this Ordinance. They are required to have the minimum acreage indicated: 1. Planned Residential Development (PRD) – Ten (10) acres. 2. Senior Residential Development (SRD) – Five (5) acres. B. Ownership Control. The land area of a planned unit development shall be a contiguous land area to consist of all property within its exterior boundaries and shall not include any islands. For purposes of this Section, an island is defined as any property in which its aggregate external boundaries abut the surrounding property contained in the planned unit development. Upon application for a PUD, all land within the land area of the planned unit development must be owned by the same individual, corporation or other legal entity. Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded, with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed. C. Standards Applying to All Planned Unit Developments. All planned unit developments shall meet the following standards and such other requirements as are set forth with respect to each of the permitted types of planned unit developments: 1. The development shall be compatible with the topography of the land and shall preserve any unusual topographic or natural features. 2. The development shall not adversely affect developed or undeveloped neighboring properties. 3. The development shall utilize design and development features that would not be possible by the application of lot-by-lot Zoning District regulations. 4. Water, sewerage, and street facilities shall be adequate for the proposed development or there shall be a definite proposal for making them so. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.2  Amended 08-10-21 5. Yards: The yard requirements of the Zoning District in which the planned unit development is located may be waived by the Mayor and Council except along the exterior boundaries of the development. Buffer zone requirements shall be met. 6. Height: The height limitation of the Zoning District in which the planned unit development is located may be waived by the Mayor and City Council. 7. Off-street parking and loading and unloading requirements: The off-street parking and loading and unloading requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be met. D. Standards Applying to Planned Residential Developments. 1. Location. A planned residential development may be located within any residential Zoning District if it meets all the required standards for planned residential developments. 2. Permitted uses. A planned residential development may contain single-family detached houses, condominiums, attached single-family houses, customary home occupations and customary residential accessory building and uses. 3. Common open space requirements. In a residential planned unit development, the lot size may be reduced from the general lot size for that district at the discretion of the Mayor and City Council. For all lots in a residential planned unit development the developer shall reserve five hundred fifty (550) square feet per lot for open space. In addition to the five hundred fifty (550) square feet per lot, the developer shall reserve an amount of land equivalent to the reduction in any lot size for open space to be preserved and maintained for its scenic values, passive recreation or conservation purposes. (Example: Lot size required by underlying zoning district is 10,000 sq. ft. A request for an 8,000 sq. ft. lot requires a set aside of 2,550 sq. ft. of open space [2,000 sq. ft. for equal offset from 10,000 sq. ft. plus 550 sq. ft. for the dwelling unit on the lot]). i. The required open space shall not include areas devoted to public or private streets and parking areas. ii. Up to one-half of the required open space may be located in a 100-year floodplain or an existing lake. iii. The required open space shall be left in its natural state as passive greenspace unless otherwise approved by the City Council. iv. If requested by the City, the owner of the planned residential development shall deed to the city the land set aside as required open space. v. If the City does not require that the land be deeded to it, then the open space shall be deeded to a property owner’s association comprised of residents of the planned residential development for the benefit of the residents. The organization of the property owner’s association and its adequate financing for the discharge of its responsibilities shall be assured through acceptable private deed covenants tied to the land. vi. In the event the property owner’s association fails to maintain the common open space properly, the City may serve written notice upon the property owner’s association and upon the residents and owners of the planned residential development setting  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.3  Amended 08-10-21 forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in a reasonable condition. Said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within thirty (30) days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice. The deficiencies are not corrected within the said thirty (30) days, the City, in order to preserve that taxable values of the properties within the planned residential development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and maintain the same for one (1) year and thereafter until the property owner’s association is prepared to provide proper maintenance. The cost to such maintenance by the City shall be assessed against the properties within the plan residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a tax lien upon said properties. 4. General private deed covenants. The entire planned residential development shall be included within private deed covenants tied to the land assuring the continuance of the planned residential development in accordance with approved plans and development. 5. Minimum lot sizes. The minimum lot sizes of the Zoning District in which the planned residential development is located may be waived by the Mayor and Council provided that any lot touching the exterior boundary of the development shall meet the minimum frontage and minimum square footage requirements for the underlying Zoning District. 6. Gross density. Except where noted herein, the overall maximum density of a planned residential development shall not exceed the density of the zone in which it is located. E. Standards Applying to Senior Residential Development. A Senior Residential District (SRD) is designed to serve the housing need of adults who are 55 years of age or older. It is recommended that these districts be located in areas that facilitate pedestrian access to nearby commercial goods and services, and/or amenities/cultural facilities. These areas are intended to function as communities with parks and open spaces. At least 80% of the occupied units shall be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older. The other 20% is not intended as a set aside for younger residents and efforts should be made to minimize the number of units that do not meet this requirement. 1. Location. An SRD shall be located within an RS-100 or R36 Zoning District. 2. Permitted Uses. Detached or attached single-family homes, villas/town homes, attached residences, plus customary residential accessory building and uses. A combination of these housing units may be used, but each type of permitted use must be clustered within the development and not randomly situated. The development plans shall indicate what type of housing units are to be located within the development. 3. Common open space requirements. No less than twenty-five (25) percent of the site acreage shall be set aside as open space, and no more than 50% can be in a Flood Hazard area, as identified by Sugar Hill Floodplain Management Ordinance. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.4  Amended 08-10-21 4. Minimum lot sizes. The minimum lot sizes of the Zoning District in which the planned residential development is located may be waived by the Mayor and Council provided that any lot touching the exterior boundary of the development shall meet the minimum frontage and minimum square footage requirements for the underlying Zoning District. 5. Area and dimensional standards: Within the SRD, the following requirements shall be met for detached homes: Maximum gross density – 5 units per acre. Minimum lot area – No minimum. Minimum lot width – 45 feet (45’) Minimum front yard – Fifteen feet (15’) Maximum front yard – Twenty five feet (25’) Minimum side yard – Five feet (5’) Minimum rear yard – Twenty feet (20’)  Within the SRD, the following requirements shall be met for attached homes: Maximum density: Eight (8) units per acre or twelve (12) units per acre where driveway access is from an alley or otherwise from the rear of the lot.

External Road Frontage For Overall Development – Fifty feet (50’) Minimum unit width: Twenty feet (20’) Minimum internal front yard – Fifteen feet (15’) Maximum internal front yard – Twenty five feet (25’) Minimum distance between buildings – Fifteen feet (15’) Minimum rear yard – Twenty feet (20’) An opaque landscape buffer of twenty-five feet (25’) shall be maintained and planted along the exterior of the development where it abuts residential zoned property of a lower density. 6. Site and Architectural Design Standards: i. A 10’ landscape strip shall be provided on the property adjacent to all public right-of-way on the exterior/perimeter of the development. The landscape strip may incorporate natural vegetation, a landscaped berm, picket type fence with brick or stone columns every 30 feet or a decorative brick or stone wall. ii. Street trees shall be planted in the right-of-way, a minimum of two feet (2’) from back of curb and spaced equal distance between street lights.

Failure of the Director of Planning and Development to respond within the thirty (30) calendar-day period shall constitute approval of the documents. The Director of Planning and Development may take legal action to stop or cancel any transfer of any property permitted in this district if any party to the transfer does not comply with all requirements of this Section. Section 1001. TOWN CENTER OVERLAY DISTRICT  The following provisions shall apply to all property inside the Town Center Overlay District (TCO) as delineated on the Town Center Overlay District Boundary Map, which is attached as Exhibit 1 and incorporated by reference. The TCO is an overlay zoning district. The land use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning remain in full force and effect except where superseded herein. When there is a provision not expressed in the underlying zone, or where a provision hereof is in conflict with the underlying zone, the provision of the overlay district shall govern. A. Purpose and Intent In preparing a Town Center Master Plan under the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) program, the City surveyed its constituents and found that the people of Sugar Hill have widely shared values related to protection of the visual environment and enhancement of the pedestrian experience Downtown. Those surveys revealed the community’s collective affinity for traditional architecture consistent with late 19th century to early 20th century American styles and the original small town feel of business districts from that era. These regulations are therefore based on the visual sensibilities of the average person in the community as well as widely accepted standards for ensuring a universally positive experience for Downtown Sugar Hill visitors, residents and businesses. Attractive and integrated architectural and urban design features tend to improve an area’s image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, as well as enhance the quality of life. Furthermore, visual harm to a widespread pattern of community preference as well as damage to the economic, architectural and social infrastructure of the City can occur without the imposition of the provisions of this Ordinance, which places limitations on or prohibits altogether certain uses, structures, and practices that would be out of harmony or incongruent with the distinctive character or visual features of the surrounding area. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.8  Amended 08-10-21 In order to establish a regulatory framework that addresses these issues this section establishes an overlay zoning district for Sugar Hill that sets up design standards and a design review process for any new construction or material change in exterior appearance to existing structures within the TCO. B. Exceptions Variances shall be processed in accordance with Article 15 of the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Ordinance. C. Severability Any requirement set forth herein deemed unconstitutional, vague, illegal and/or otherwise unenforceable in a court of law shall not invalidate the remainder of this Section and all other provisions and requirements of this Section shall remain in full force and effect. D. Use Provisions. 1. Maximum Building Height. Maximum building height shall be 4 stories with a maximum of 50 feet. 2. Mixed Use. Mixed uses are encouraged within the TCO. Refer to Section 1003 Mixed Use Developments. 4. Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors. Georgia Highway 20 (Hwy 20) and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard (PIB) intersect each other near the western edge of the TCO. While these regionally important arterial roadways create significant challenges for development within the TCO they move a large amount of people and goods around Downtown Sugar Hill on a daily basis. In consideration of the heavy volume and higher speeds of vehicular traffic along these corridors adequate provisions should be granted to facilitate appropriate commercial development which addresses the needs of our traveling consumers while promoting pedestrian oriented development patterns within Downtown Sugar Hill. Therefore, the uses shown below in table 1001.D.4 shall only be allowed if granted a special use permit by the City Council provided that the property abuts Hwy 20 or PIB for at least 350 feet of continuous frontage, does not interfere with the safe and normal flow of traffic, is not within 1,320 feet of Hillcrest Street, has an existing commercial driveway permit from the state or county Department of Transportation, is not within 1,320 feet of a similar use along the same direction of travel and meets the specific conditions associated with each use as shown in table 1001.D.4. In addition to the criteria set forth in Article 17 of this Zoning Ordinance, in deliberating a special use permit under this section, the Council shall consider the: a. Appropriateness of the use based on the development of surrounding properties; b. Any benefit or harm to the surrounding properties and the TCO as a result of the use; and c. Whether the use is consistent with the intent of the TCO and this section. 5. Prohibited Uses. Unless otherwise noted, the following uses shall be prohibited within the TCO: Adult entertainment businesses/facilities; automotive sales lots and associated service facilities; automobile repair shops and tire stores including lubrication or tune up centers; truck stops; service stations; boarding and rooming houses; contractors equipment depot; restaurants with drive-through  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.9  Amended 08-10-21 service; equipment rental; facilities engaging in the business, trade, or profession of psychic reading, fortune telling, astrology, phrenology, palmistry, clairvoyance, or related practices; adult novelty retail stores; pawn shops; body art establishment; cannabidiol store; vape store; vehicle or emission inspections; warehousing; mini-warehouse/personal storage facilities; moving van or truck rental and taxi/limousine queue lots. If any of the above listed uses exist within the TCO prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, those uses shall, upon the adoption of this Ordinance become non-conforming uses, shall comply with and be governed by Article 8 of the Zoning Ordinance. Table 1001.D.4 – Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors and Associated Conditions Use: Conditions: 1. Convenience store, with or without fuel pumps. Signs are prohibited on fuel pumps, canopy and other accessory structures. Vehicle washing facility is prohibited. Fuel pumps and associated canopy shall be located in the side or rear yard.

The Council is authorized to receive, consider, approve, approve with conditions, table, request more information or deny applications for Certificate of Design Review as required by this Ordinance. In granting a design review approval, the Council may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance and operation of any use or building, in addition to those expressly set forth herein, as may be deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. 2. Design Review and Approval Required Within the TCO, no new construction of any building or land improvement; no material change in exterior appearance of any existing building, structure or activity; nor any other type of development shall be allowed until an application for design review has been approved by the Council in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance and all other applicable ordinances and regulations. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.13  Amended 08-10-21 Building permit or land disturbance permit applications may be filed simultaneously with a design review application; however, no permits shall be issued prior to approval of the design review application by the Council. 3. Application Requirements All applications for design review approval shall be made as required by the City Manager and shall at minimum contain the following information: i) Elevation Drawings, Color and Material Samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure, alterations, and/or additions to existing structures shall be accompanied by exterior elevation color renderings, drawn to scale and signed by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional. These shall be submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the City Manager. Said exterior elevation color renderings shall clearly show in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of proposed change(s) to buildings or structures and new construction, as applicable. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials, textures and colors, and provide samples of materials and colors. ii) Photographs. All applications shall be accompanied by photographs of all sides of the existing building(s) or structure(s) affected, and of adjoining properties. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy and in digital form unless otherwise specified by the City Manager. iii) Site Plan and Landscaping Plan.

The City Manager may reasonably require any additional information to be submitted with the application. 4. Criteria for Acting on Design Review Applications In reviewing applications for design review, the Council shall consider the appropriateness of the design of any building or any proposed material change in exterior appearance in the context of the following criteria: i) Consistency with any adopted design guidelines for the type of development, and/or the proposed use. ii) The nature and character of the surrounding areas, and the consistency and compatibility of the proposed application with such nature and character. iii) The general design, character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, texture, materials, and colors of the structure in question and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate surrounding area, site, and landscaping. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia      Planned Unit Developments  10.14  Amended 08-10-21 iv) As long as the interior arrangement or use will not have any effect on exterior architectural features and complies with the standards herein it will not be considered. v) The following are other grounds for considering a design inappropriate. - Character foreign to the area. - Arresting and spectacular effects. - Violent contrasts of material or color, or intense or lurid colors. - A multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance. - The absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character of the present structure or surrounding area. 5. Action by the Council Once a Certificate of Design Review application is determined complete and is accepted by the City Manager, it shall be forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting. If the City Manager fails to accept or reject an application within 30 calendar days of receipt it shall be deemed accepted and forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting. The Council may approve the application and direct the City Manager to issue a Certificate of Design Review if it finds that the proposed material change in exterior appearance or development would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic or architectural significance and value of adjacent and nearby properties, and if the Council finds the application is consistent with the criteria for acting on applications above. The Council may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper and conditionally approve the application if the applicant agrees to the conditions, or the Council may deny the application as submitted. In the event the Council rejects an application, it shall state its reason(s) for doing so and the City Manager shall transmit a record of such action and reason(s) for rejection, in writing, to the applicant. The Council may also table the application or request more information. The applicant, if he or she desires, may make modifications to the plan(s) and may resubmit the application. 6. Enforcement and Appeals Refer to Article 14. Administration, Enforcement, Penalties and Remedies for inspection and enforcement procedures. Refer to Article 15. Variances and Appeals for procedures and filing requirements. Except applications for design review of a sign which shall follow the procedures and filing requirements for administrative variance.

CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OVERLAY  The following provisions shall apply to all property inside the Central Business District (CBD) as delineated on the Central Business District Boundary Map, which is attached as Exhibit 2 and incorporated by reference. The CBD is an overlay zoning district. The land use regulations applicable to the Town Center Overlay District (TCO), the Central Business District (CBD), as well as the underlying zoning remain in full force and effect except where superseded herein. When there is a provision not expressed in the TCO or underlying zone, or where a provision hereof is in conflict with the TCO or underlying zone, the provision of the CBD overlay district shall govern. A. Purpose and Intent To further the goals of the Downtown Sugar Hill LCI Study and to foster development of the city center that contributes to the function and feel of traditional small town business districts prominent throughout this region during the late 19th century to the early 20th century. To recreate this feeling by using traditional block patterns characterized by common side walls, building fronts abutting the sidewalk and on street parking; breaking up large blocks; optimizing multi-modal connectivity and incorporating small public gathering spaces. In order to establish a regulatory framework that creates this traditional small town urban character; promotes compact mixed use growth; supports community development and the need for walkable, pedestrian oriented public and commercial spaces; provides incentives and removes barriers to redevelopment, rehabilitation and revitalization of vacant and underutilized properties in the area this section establishes an overlay zoning district for Sugar Hill that provides for an appropriate mix of uses, establishes standards of development to facilitate urban forms and sets up a design review process for any new construction or material change in appearance to existing structures within the CBD. B. Exceptions Variances shall be processed in accordance with Article 15 of the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Ordinance. C. Severability Any requirement set forth herein deemed unconstitutional, vague, illegal and/or otherwise unenforceable in a court of law shall not invalidate the remainder of this Section and all other provisions and requirements of this Section shall remain in full force and effect.

Residential or office uses in buildings containing retail or other uses are encouraged and the acreage on which such buildings are located may be used in either or both classifications for density purposes. 7. Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors. The CBD is bounded on two sides by Georgia State Route 20 (SR20) and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard (PIB). While these regionally important arterial roadways create physical limits to the development and expansion of the CBD they move a large amount of people and goods around Downtown Sugar Hill on a daily basis. In consideration of the heavy volume and higher speeds of vehicular traffic along these corridors adequate provisions should be granted to facilitate appropriate commercial development which addresses the needs of our traveling consumers while promoting pedestrian oriented development patterns within Downtown Sugar Hill. Therefore, the uses shown below in table 1002.D.7 shall only be allowed if granted a special use permit by the City Council provided that the property abuts Hwy 20 or PIB for at least 350 feet of continuous frontage, does not interfere with the safe and normal flow of traffic, is not within 1,320 feet of Hillcrest Street, has an existing commercial driveway permit from the state or county Department of Transportation, is not within 1320 feet of a similar use along the same direction of travel and meets the specific conditions associated with each use as shown in table 1002.D.7. In addition to the criteria set forth in Article 17 of this Zoning Ordinance, in deliberating a special use permit under this section, the Council shall consider the: a. Appropriateness of the use based on the development of surrounding properties; b. Any benefit or harm to the surrounding properties and the CBD as a result of the use; and c. Whether the use is consistent with the intent of the CBD and this section. Table 1002.D.7 – Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors and Associated Conditions Use: Conditions: 1. Convenience store, with or without fuel pumps. Signs are prohibited on fuel pumps, canopy and other accessory structures. Vehicle washing facility is prohibited. Fuel pumps and associated canopy shall be located in the side or rear yard. Outdoor display of items for sale are prohibited.

These design criteria and standards shall be used to evaluate every development, redevelopment, rehabilitation and building project whether new or a change in appearance on all properties located within the boundaries of the CBD. 1. Design Criteria – Physical Relationship to Streetscape:  All forms of ground transportation are important to the urban infrastructure of Downtown Sugar Hill and access to all modes to include auto, pedestrian, bus and bicycle should be encouraged. Providing for transportation choices allows our less mobile citizens to get around with dignity and may reduce congestion in and around Downtown. Standards: i) All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley access. ii) All buildings adjacent to Alton Tucker Blvd and West Broad St must align with the sidewalk edge and have their principal orientation toward the street except to accommodate features that enhance the pedestrian experience and contribute to the character of the streetscape such as outdoor dining areas, exhibition spaces for art, gathering space for events or lines such as a ticket window, gardens, courtyards or similar recessed features. iii) Buildings shall be set back from the right-of-way between zero (0) and twelve (12) feet. Porches, canopies and awnings may extend into the front setback up to six (6) feet but shall not encroach into the right-of-way or within 6’ of back of curb. No front loading attached garages shall be permitted. All attached garages shall be side or rear entry. Zero (0) foot side setbacks are allowed for attached residential dwellings and nonresidential buildings. Detached residential dwellings shall be subject to the underlying zoning district’s setback requirements. iv) New structures shall fit in with the surrounding buildings. Refer to Appendix B for suggested guidelines on siting new buildings. v)   Large scale single use facilities such as conference spaces, theaters and athletic facilities shall generally occur behind or above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation. Such facilities may exceed maximum first floor area standards if so sited. No structure shall exceed 30,000 square feet as a single use. vi) Parking structures adjacent to a street shall be oriented with its shortest dimension along the street frontage and shall include facilities for commercial or office space at the ground level for at least 50% of the frontage. A landscaped pedestrian plaza shall make up any remaining frontage. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia       Overlay Zoning Districts  10.22  Amended 08-10-21 vii) All development shall coordinate pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns with adjacent buildings and sites as well as interconnect with existing adjacent sidewalks. Where development adjoins undeveloped properties, the sidewalk for the new project shall terminate at the property line at a point where the next project can continue the sidewalk along the public right-of-way with little difficulty in vertical or horizontal transition. viii) Access connections shall be required where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to important civic uses such as churches, schools, parks, transportation and other critical community facilities. ix) Mechanical and electrical equipment, solar collectors, satellite dishes, dumpsters, compactors, storage tanks, utility meters, valves, vents and other similar equipment shall be located to the rear of the building or otherwise concealed from public street view. x) Adjacent to public streets and dedicated pedestrian walkways, chain link, razor wire, barbed wire, corrugated metal, plastic, exposed concrete and exposed concrete block walls and fences are prohibited. xi) Walls and fences shall have vertical articulation at least every 40 linear feet. 2. Design Criteria – Pedestrian Experience:  Providing a visual connection to the civic uses from the commercial uses inside each building and more private uses on upper floors may increase the level of awareness and self-policing among the users of Downtown Sugar Hill. This additional interaction will contribute to the sense of safety for the pedestrian community, residents and business owners. Standards: i) Building facades longer than 40 feet shall be visually divided into segments of no more than 20 feet through articulation of the façade achieved through methods such as but not limited to architectural recesses, breaks in materials, additional window bays, variation in roof line, and building setback. ii) Streetscape elements such as benches, trash receptacles, fencing and/or bike racks shall match the finish, style, design, material and quality of the approved City of Sugar Hill streetscape elements found in Appendix A, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Dining tables and chairs in outdoor seating areas shall be maintained clean and in good condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance. All metal and wood furniture shall be finished to preserve their natural color or match colors from the exterior color palettes shown in Appendix A. Wood furniture may be stained to preserve their natural texture and color.

Application Requirements All applications for design review approval shall be made as required by the City Manager and shall at minimum contain the following information:  i) Elevation Drawings, Color and Material Samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure, alterations, and/or additions to existing structures shall be accompanied by exterior elevation color renderings, drawn to scale and signed by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional. These shall be submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the City Manager. Said exterior elevation color renderings shall clearly show in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of proposed change(s) to buildings or structures and new construction, as applicable. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials, textures and colors, and provide samples of materials and colors. ii) Photographs. All applications shall be accompanied by photographs of all sides of the existing building(s) or structure(s) affected, and of adjoining properties. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy and in digital form unless otherwise specified by the City Manager. iii) Site Plan and Landscaping Plan.

A fee, as may be established by the Mayor and City Council, shall be submitted for said application. v) Additional Information. The City Manager may reasonably require any additional information to be submitted with the application. 4. Criteria for Acting on Design Review Applications In reviewing applications for design review, the Council shall consider the appropriateness of the design of any building or any proposed material change in exterior appearance in the context of the following criteria: i) Consistency with any adopted design guidelines for the type of development, and/or the proposed use. ii) The nature and character of the surrounding areas, and the consistency and compatibility of the proposed application with such nature and character. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia       Overlay Zoning Districts  10.26  Amended 08-10-21 iii) The general design, character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, texture, materials, and colors of the structure in question and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate surrounding area, site, and landscaping. iv) As long as the interior arrangement or use will not have any effect on exterior architectural features and complies with the standards herein it will not be considered. v) The following are other grounds for considering a design inappropriate. - Character foreign to the area. - Arresting and spectacular effects. - Violent contrasts of material or color, or intense or lurid colors. - A multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance. - The absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character of the present structure or surrounding area. 5. Action by the Council Once a Certificate of Design Review application is determined complete and is accepted by the City Manager, it shall be forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting. If the City Manager fails to accept or reject an application within 30 calendar days of receipt it shall be deemed accepted and forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting. The Council may approve the application and direct the City Manager to issue a Certificate of Design Review if it finds that the proposed material change in exterior appearance or development would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic or architectural significance and value of adjacent and nearby properties, and if the Council finds the application is consistent with the criteria for acting on applications above. The Council may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper and conditionally approve the application if the applicant agrees to the conditions, or the Council may deny the application as submitted. In the event the Council rejects an application, it shall state its reason(s) for doing so and the City Manager shall transmit a record of such action and reason(s) for rejection, in writing, to the applicant. The Council may also table the application or request more information. The applicant, if he or she desires, may make modifications to the plan(s) and may resubmit the application. 6. Enforcement and Appeals Refer to Article 14. Administration, Enforcement, Penalties and Remedies for inspection and enforcement procedures. Refer to Article 15. Variances and Appeals for procedures and filing requirements. Except applications for design review of a sign which shall follow the procedures and filing requirements for administrative variance.

MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS A. Intent and Purpose. The Mixed Use Development Districts are established for the following purposes: 1. To encourage larger scale mixed use development which will produce a logically organized and compatible set of land uses resulting in a higher overall quality of development than if accomplished in incremental unplanned stages. 2. To allow a mixture and/or density of land uses not otherwise allowed in an established zoning district; by careful site planning the appropriate site improvements are incorporated into the plan that establish compatible relationships between uses within the site and uses adjacent to the site. 3. To encourage creative site design which seeks to preserve the open space and unique environmental features, conserve energy through efficient building design and clustering, efficiently use the land, and increase the efficiency of public service delivery. 4. To be applied in a manner consistent with the Land Use Plan for the City of Sugar Hill. B. General Conditions. An area may be considered for rezoning to a Mixed Use Development District if any one of the following conditions exists: 1. The characteristics of the specific site plan and uses proposed for the subject property would only be compatible with the surrounding area if the development were limited to those plans and uses as submitted. 2. Separate land uses, which would not otherwise be permitted to locate within the same zoning district, are proposed for development on one or more adjacent parcels under single ownership. 3. Exceptions or variation from the size, setback, frontage, density, uses or other standards which are required in the conventional zoning districts are being proposed as a part of a planned development. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia       Overlay Zoning Districts  10.29  Amended 08-10-21 C. Uses Within a Mixed Use Development. Any use allowable inherently or by City Council approval in the conventional zoning districts set forth herein may be proposed for inclusion in Mixed Use Development. Each proposed use should be consistent in application with the intent and purpose of the conventional zoning districts in which it is allowed. Only the specific uses proposed in an application and approved shall be allowed in the district. Any addition of uses, change of plans, or increase in size or density shall require a separate amendment to the original approved Mixed Use Development and shall follow the same administrative process as any other amendment. Initial approval of a Mixed Use Development by the City of Sugar Hill does not mean that subsequent amendments to that Mixed Use Development carry any requirement to be approved. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and land uses which are presented with an application for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and as such shall become a part of these zoning regulations. D. Required Report and Plans. The plans required for inclusion in an application shall be prepared by a registered engineer, architect, land surveyor or landscape architect, proof of which shall be their official registration seal appearing on the plans submitted. Each Mixed Use Development shall consist of a written report and a set of site plans prepared in accordance with the following guidelines: Written Report. A written report shall be submitted which will explain the type, nature, size, intent, and characteristics of the proposed development. This report shall include, where applicable:  1. General description and location. 2. The physical and socio-economic reasons as to why the uses proposed in the planned development would provide a better overall use of this property over the current zoning. 3. The proposed provision of utilities, including water, sewer and drainage facilities. 4. The proposed methods for protection of abutting properties. 5. The proposed densities and total number of acres or square footage for each allowable type of land use, including public facilities and common open space or recreational areas. 6. The proposed maintenance and ownership agreements for any streets and common open spaces not proposed for dedication to the City of Sugar Hill. 7. The proposed standards of development, including restriction on the use of the property, setback requirements and proposed restrictive covenants. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia       Overlay Zoning Districts  10.30  Amended 08-10-21 8. The names and mailing addresses of all adjoining property owners. 9. Additional relevant data as required by the City Manager. Required Site Plans. A detailed site plan prepared by a registered engineer, architect, land surveyor or landscape architect shall be required for all Mixed Use Developments. The required site plan shall include as a minimum the following information: 1. A survey of the property indicating all property dimensions, property size, adjoining owners, scale, north arrow and tie in point to a known location (road intersection/land lot corner, etc.) 2. Topography with contour intervals no greater than 20 feet. 3. Lakes, ponds, and floodplains and the sources of floodplain data. 4. Proposed subdivision of the property, streets, ingress and egress to each building site, internal access and circulation (both pedestrian and auto), off-street parking areas, and public facilities and open areas. 5. Storm water detention areas. 6. The proposed architectural style and siting of all structures. 7. Lot lines, sizes, setbacks and proposed location, shape, size, height and lot coverage of all structures. 8. Floor plans and elevations of all typical units. Administrative Review. All of the above identified requirements of the written report and site plan, as well as any other requirements of this zoning ordinance, shall be met before the Mixed Use Development re-zoning request is presented to the Planning Commission for its review and recommendation. Specific requirements of the administrative review process are as follows: 1. The City Manager shall be responsible for reviewing the written report and site plan, and verifying the adequacy of both to appear on the Planning Commission agenda. 2. The City Manager shall periodically prepare, post and distribute a timetable for his review and verification of the required exhibits. 3. Neither the Planning Commission, Director, nor any other appointed official shall  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia       Overlay Zoning Districts  10.31  Amended 08-10-21 possess the authority to waive any of the written report or site plan requirements. 4. An applicant for a Mixed Use Development re-zoning may present a written request to the City Council to waive individual requirements of the written report or site plan; however, a separate request must be submitted for each requested waiver, and must include a specific and valid reason as to why the waiver is necessary. Economic hardship shall not constitute or be considered as a valid reason for a waiver request. E. Types of Mixed Use Developments. Commercial Office Districts (COD) 1. A commercial office district must abut either Peachtree Industrial Boulevard or Nelson Brogdon Boulevard for a distance of at least 250 feet. 2.

The area included for density requirements also shall not include more than 50% of any flood plain or stream buffer area. F. General Provisions. 1. The City Manager is authorized to approve minor changes to Mixed Use Developments without submitting the changes to the Mayor and Council. Minor changes include increases in lot sizes, decreases in density or the number of lots or residential units, street modifications that are required by Gwinnett County Department of Transportation or the Georgia Department of Transportation for safety reasons and which do not affect the general street layout or number of access points to the development, and minor adjustments to layout required as a result of engineering data not available at the time of the approval of the plan by the Mayor and Council and which does not significantly change the development or adversely impact any adjacent properties. Any major changes in the development and the site plan approved as part of the approval of the development shall be resubmitted to the Mayor and Council as a zoning change and shall require approval of the Mayor and Council. Major changes include, but are not limited to, reductions in lot sizes, changes in the wording of any zoning conditions specifically approved by the Mayor and Council, increase in density or the number of lots; street modifications that would affect adjacent properties, change the basic street structure of the development or change the number of entry or exits to the development, or other changes deemed by the Director of Planning and Development to constitute major changes. 2. A site plan shall be incorporated into each ordinance approving a Mixed Use Development and shall be a condition of zoning. Any changes to the site plan which constitute a major change as described above shall constitute a change in zoning and shall require a submittal to the Mayor and Council. If changes are made at the time of approval of the zoning which require changes to the site plan submitted and reviewed by the Mayor and Council, the Mayor and Council may provide in its ordinance for the necessary changes to be made and submitted to the City Manager for approval. Upon such approval by the City Manager, a copy of the revised and approved site plan shall be submitted to the Mayor and Council at  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance               Article 10 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia       Overlay Zoning Districts  10.34  Amended 08-10-21 their next monthly meeting and placed on the agenda for acceptance and ratification by the Mayor and Council. 3. At the time of approval of the development, the Mayor and Council may place appropriate conditions on the development which requires the sequencing of the development. By way of example, the Council may require that no more than 50% of the residential development be completed and occupied before at least 25% of the commercial or office development is completed and occupied.

STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAE AND TOWERS  SECTION 1351. PURPOSES. This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Sugar Hill, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Sugar Hill so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Sugar Hill as a proactive city in the availability of wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall:  A. Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities to serve the residents and businesses of the City of Sugar Hill;  B. Protect the City of Sugar Hill’s built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; C. Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; D. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;  E. Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the City;  F. Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and G. Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use. SECTION 1352. DEFINITIONS. As used in this ordinance, terms shall have the meanings indicated in Article 3 of the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Ordinance. SECTION 1353. EXCLUSIONS. The following shall be exempt from this ordinance:  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance        Article 13.5 Standards for of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia    Telecommunications Antennae  And Towers       13.5.2  A.

Any monopole tower and antenna one hundred (100) feet or less located in an electrical substation. H. Any telecommunications facilities operative on the effective date of this ordinance. SECTION 1354. PLACEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BY ZONING DISTRICT. A. In Light Industrial (HM-1) and Heavy Industrial (HM-2) zoning districts telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers are permitted as a use by right up to a height of 120 feet following design review and approval by the Director. Telecommunications towers greater than 120 feet in height shall require a Special Use Permit. An additional 20 feet may be allowed by right for towers, which provide proof of three (3) or more companies locating on the same tower. B. In General Business (BG) and Light Manufacturing (LM) zoning districts antennas shall be allowed as a use by right on existing structures. New towers and antennas greater than seventy (70) feet in height shall be allowed if permitted by a Special Use Permit approved by the City Council following design review by the Director.

E. Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built upon approval of a Special Use Permit except for variances to the Zoning Ordinance setbacks for a specific zoning district which shall be presented to the Zoning Board of Appeals unless the request is part of a Special Use Permit application which is presented to the City Council. SECTION 1355. PREFERRED LOCATION SITES. A. Publicly used structures: Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. B. Co-Location Sites: Any existing site on which a legal wireless telecommunications facility is currently located shall be a Preferred Location Site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this ordinance and co-location sites shall not become an “antenna farm” or otherwise be deemed by the Director or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance        Article 13.5 Standards for of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia    Telecommunications Antennae  And Towers       13.5.4  C. Industrial and Commercial Structures: Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be Preferred Locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications system. D. Mixed Use Buildings in Planned Development Districts: Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other non-residential space) are also Preferred Location sites. SECTION 1356. REQUIREMENTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. A. General Requirements for All Telecommunications Facilities: The requirements set forth in this Section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance. 1. Building Codes and Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities that are published by the FCC as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the Director. 2. Regulatory Compliance: All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 3. Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be enclosed by decay- resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. This requirement may be waived by the Director if it is deemed that this would produce negative visual clutter or obstruct a view corridor. 4. Lighting: No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless part of a approved public lighting program or required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance        Article 13.5 Standards for of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia    Telecommunications Antennae  And Towers       13.5.5  Director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 5. Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. 6. Visual Impact:  a. Telecommunications facilities shall, subject to applicable standards of the FAA or other federal or state agencies, be maintained with a galvanized metal finish, painted a neutral color, or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Telecommunications facilities located in residentially zoned areas shall be painted in a neutral color or textured to match the existing environment to minimize visual obtrusiveness. If federal or state regulations require, telecommunication facilities shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or other required finish. b. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower and is generally visible to the public, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to , or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers, or other background. c. Antennas mounted on architecturally significant structures or significant architectural details of the building shall be covered by appropriate casings, which are manufactured to match existing architectural features found on the building. d. Where feasible, antennas can be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. e. Towers or roof mounted antennas shall not be placed in direct line with significant view corridors, as designated by the City of Sugar Hill or by any state or federal law or agency. For purposes of this ordinance a significant view corridor shall be defined as an area to be kept free of obstructions or structures which interfere with the view of any scenic area, or historic building or area. A view corridor shall be established by ordinance of the City of Sugar Hill, by zoning restrictions adopted in accordance with the ordinances of the City of Sugar Hill, or by any state or federal law or agency in accordance with provisions of federal laws or duly adopted regulations. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance        Article 13.5 Standards for of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia    Telecommunications Antennae  And Towers       13.5.6   f. Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters shall be screened from public view and may use landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding structures. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 7. Landscaping:  a. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. b. Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. c. The Director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the Director. 8. Maintenance Impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. Access drives and maintenance vehicle parking shall be paved unless the requirement is waived by the Director. 9. Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses:  a. Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower. b. Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same build able area. Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile,  The 2000 Zoning Ordinance        Article 13.5 Standards for of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia    Telecommunications Antennae  And Towers       13.5.7  flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 10. Lot Size and Setbacks:  a. The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to:  (1) Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in Section 1356 (A)(7); (2) Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; and (3) Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer’s analysis required in Section 1357 (B)(1)(d.)(iv.). 11. The proposed project must not disrupt the overall community character. For purposes of this ordinance, the term overall community character shall be determined by applying the criteria set forth in Section 1707 of Article 17 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia.

All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the Director or his designee any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the minimum Standard Building Code or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have thirty (30) days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within thirty (30) days, the City may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the City may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal or seek costs incurred through court action. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City’s right to take action. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the minimum Standard Building Code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed.

The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City’s right to take action. The City may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owners’ or operator’s intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. B. If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.

PRE-EXISTING TOWERS/NON-CONFORMING USE. A. All telecommunications facilities operative on the effective date of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a non-conforming use and shall be treated as a non-conforming use in accordance with Article 8 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Sugar Hill. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance. The Director may approve the addition of twenty (20) feet to any existing tower whereby it can be shown that this would provide for co-location and eliminate the need for a new tower and it is determined that adequate site area exists for the location of any equipment buildings. Approval of an additional twenty (20) feet applies to all zoning districts, however, additions greater than twenty (20) feet shall require a Special Use Permit. B. A telecommunications facility that has received City approval in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired. C. Placement of an antenna on a non-conforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the non-conforming structure. SECTION 1364. COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL LAW. Whenever the Governing Authority finds that the application of this ordinance would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a Special Use Permit waiving any or all of the provisions of this ordinance may be granted. SECTION 1365. SEVERABILITY. A. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

To hear and decide requests for Special Exceptions of the Zoning Ordinance. 3. To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Council that: a. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape or topography, or b. The application of the Ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship, or c. Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; d. Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner, and e.

The City Manager shall forthwith transmit to the City Council all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the City Manager certifies to the City Council that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such a case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by Order of the Councilor by a restraining order granted by a court of record on application and notice to the City Manager for good cause shown. Section 1503. Required Public Hearings Before the Council acts upon an application for a Variance or a Special Exception, it shall hold a public hearing thereon.

Whether a proposed rezoning will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; b. Whether a proposed rezoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; c. Whether the property to be affected by a proposed rezoning has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; d. Whether the proposed rezoning will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools; e. Whether the proposed rezoning is in conformity with the policy and intent of the Land Use Plan; and f.

Section 1703. Impact Analysis. If a proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property and involves a change in the zoning classification of 10 or fewer parcels of land, then: 7. The initiating party, if a party other than the City Council or Planning Commission, shall be required to file, with its application for amendment, a written, documented analysis of the impact of the proposed zoning with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 1702 above.

The Planning Commission shall, with respect to each such zoning proposal, investigate and make a recommendation with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 1702 above. The Planning Commission shall make a written record of its investigation and recommendations, and this record shall be a public record. Section 1704. Action by City Council. Following its public hearing the City Council may: a. Adopt the proposed amendment as presented; b. Adopt the proposed amendment as revised or supplemented by conditions of approval established by the City Council, said revisions may include, if the proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property, rezoning to the proposed Zoning District with conditions or rezoning to any other less intense Zoning District with or without conditions; c. Deny the proposed amendment in whole or in part; d. Table the proposal; or e. Approve the petition for amendment to be withdrawn with the consent of a majority of the City Council. Section 1705. Conditional Zoning. In adopting an amendment to the Zoning Map, or approving a Special Use Permit or a Variance, the City Council may impose special conditions which it deems necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the purposes of the district(s) involved and to further the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Such conditions may consist of: setback requirements from any lot line; specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other land uses; driveway curb cut restrictions; restrictions as to what land uses or activities shall be permitted; maximum building heights or other dimensions; special drainage or erosion provisions; landscaping or planted area which may include the location, type and maintenance of plant materials; fences, walls, berms, or other buffering provisions or protective measures; preservation of existing trees or other vegetation; special measures to alleviate undesirable views, light, glare, noise, dust or odor; permitted hours of operation; architectural style; a requirement that the existing building(s) be retained; a requirement that developers must build according to the site plans as adopted; a limitation on exterior modifications of existing buildings; or any other requirement that the City Council may deem appropriate and necessary as a condition of rezoning or issuance of a variance or Special Use Permit. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance       Article 17 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia            Amendments 17.7 Such conditions: 1. Shall only be valid if they are included in the motion approving the amendment for adoption; 2. Shall be in effect for the period of time specified in the amendment; 3. Shall be required of the property owner and all subsequent owners as a condition of their use of the property; and 4. Shall be interpreted and continually enforced by the City Manager in the same manner as any other provision of this Ordinance. Section 1706. Special Use Permits. The Special Use Permit is designed to be used when: a. A Special Use listed under the Zoning District is desired for development and a more intensive Zoning District which contains that use as a use by right would not be appropriate for the property, or, b. A Special Use listed under the Zoning District is desired for development and no Zoning District contains that use as a use by right, or, c. A unique use not addressed in any Zoning District is desired for development and is not likely to be duplicated within City of Sugar Hill, or, d. The density of development may be affected by the height of a building, or, e. The neighboring properties may be affected by the height of any structure, and, f. The Special Use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood or the community as a whole, be compatible with the neighborhood and would not be in conflict with the overall objective of the Comprehensive Plan. Section 1707. Special Use Permit Procedure. In order to accommodate Special Uses, the Special Use Permit allows the City Council to approve a Special Use on a particular parcel without changing the general Zoning District. Such approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth below and any additional conditions deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the Special Use with the surrounding properties. All Special Use Permit applications shall be for firm development proposals only. The Special Use Permit shall not be used for securing early zoning for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for some time. A Special Use Permit application shall be considered only if it is made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. The minimum requirements for a Special Use Permit are: 1. Any uses permitted under a Special Use Permit shall also conform to the requirements of this Ordinance and the Development Regulations for the use as found in the Zoning District. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance       Article 17 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia            Amendments 17.8 2. The application and review process for a Special Use Permit shall be the same as for the Zoning District under which the Special Use is found. In addition to the information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional information deemed necessary by the City Manager in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted. In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to the evaluation of the characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to its immediate neighborhood and the compatibility of the proposed use with its neighborhood. 3. In the approval process for a Special Use Permit application, the City Council shall consider the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially in regards but not limited to traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities. 4. If an application is approved and a Special Use Permit is granted, all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. Once established, the Special Use shall be in continuous operation. Upon discovery that the operation of the Special Use has or had ceased for a period of 90 days or more and the owner of the property has not requested voluntary termination of the Special Use Permit, the City Manager shall forward a report to the City Council through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 5. Changes to a Special Use, or development of a site for the Special Use, shall be treated as an amendment to the Special Use Permit and shall be subject to the same application and review process as a new application. 6. The Special Use for which a Special Use Permit is granted shall commence operations or construction within 12 months of the date of approval by the City Council. If, at the end of this 12-month period, the City Manager determines that active efforts are not proceeding toward operation or construction, a report may be forwarded to the City Council through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 7. An application for a Special Use Permit in a residential district and which use is proposed to operate in a dwelling or as an accessory use to a dwelling is subject to the following additional requirements: a. The Special Use Permit shall be valid for no more than a two-year period. Upon or before the expiration of a Special Use Permit, the owner shall make application to continue the Special Use Permit if continuance is desired. However, after the first two year period the City Council may waive the two year time limitation with the concurrence of the Planning Commission. b. The Special Use shall operate within the dwelling on the property or, if approved by the City Council, in an accessory structure. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance       Article 17 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia            Amendments 17.9 c. The exterior character of the dwelling shall be preserved in its residential state and there shall be no outside evidence of the operation of the Special Use to the neighborhood, except for any accessory structure approved by the City Council. d. The owner of the property shall occupy the property and shall operate any business associated with the Special Use. e. The owner of the property shall submit with the application a signed statement in which he/she agrees that the Special Use Permit, if approved, shall automatically terminate in the event that the property is sold, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to any other party, or the business which operates the Special Use is sold, transferred, otherwise conveyed or discontinued. The owner shall also agree to notify the City Manager in writing upon the occurrence of any of these events f. In addition to the information and/or site plans required by this Section, the owner of the property shall submit with the application for a Special Use Permit information regarding the ownership of any business associated with the use, the experience and background qualifications related to the operation of said business, prior similar businesses operated, applicable State of Georgia certifications, licenses and like information. 8. The owner of the property approved for a Special Use Permit, may voluntarily request termination of the Special Use Permit by notifying the City Manager in writing. The City Manager shall notify the City Council through the Planning Commission of the voluntary termination as they occur and shall change the official zoning maps to reflect any voluntary termination. The approval of a Special Use Permit for a specific use which may be operated by a lessee under a private agreement with a lessor in any non-residential district shall not obligate the City Council to be responsible for or be required to resolve any disputes which may arise out of the voluntary termination of the Special Use Permit by the property owner. 9. The City shall have the right to periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine compliance with the requirements and any conditions. If the City Manager determines that the requirements and conditions are being violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the property outlining the nature of the violation and giving the owner of the property a maximum of ten (10) days to come into compliance. If after ten (10) days the violations continue to exist, the City Manager shall forward a report to the City Council through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 10. Upon approval by the City Council, a Special Use Permit shall be identified on the official zoning maps. 11. Upon approval by the City Council of a Special Use Permit, the owner of the property shall be issued a notice from the City Manager which states the specific use permitted, the requirements of this Section and any conditions attached to the approval. The 2000 Zoning Ordinance       Article 17 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia            Amendments 17.10 12. The City shall not issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the Special Use Permit have been fulfilled by the owner of the property. SECTION 1708. Policies and Procedures. For purposes of this section the terms “zoning decision” shall have the meanings set forth in O.C.G.A. §36-66-3.

The 2000 Zoning Ordinance       Article 17 of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia            Amendments 17.11 Section 1710. Lapse of Time Requirement for an Amendment, Variance or Special Use Permit Re-application. The following shall apply to the applicable re-application: If an application is denied by the City Council, or Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate, no application or re-application for the same Zoning Map amendment, Variance, or Special Use Permit affecting the same land or any portion thereof shall be acted upon within twelve (12) months from the date of last action, unless such twelve (12) month period is waived by the City Council or Zoning Board of Appeals as appropriate, and in no case may such an application or re-application be reconsidered in less than six (6) months from the date of that action by the City Council or Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate.

Such properties may first be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which shall make such findings and recommendations as it deems appropriate.

The purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards for wireless telecommunications facilities. The underlying principles of these standards are as follows: A. To achieve a balance among the number, height, and density of wireless telecommunications facilities that is appropriate for our communities. B. To encourage and maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings, and other structures to accommodate new wireless telecommunications facilities. C. To ensure the compatibility of towers with, and avoid adverse impacts to nearby properties. D. To discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the City of Chelsea. 9.37.2. Objectives. The proposed locations and design of all communication towers shall consider the following public health, safety, and general welfare objectives: A. Structural Safety. The proposed tower will comply with wind loading and other structural standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents, employees, or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. B. View Protection. The proposed tower facility will be designed to minimize adverse visual impacts to surrounding properties and the public right-of-way, given the topography of the proposed site and surrounding area. C. Land Use Compatibility. The proposed tower facility will be compatible with the surrounding land uses, given the character of the use and development of the location. D. Design Harmony. The proposed tower facility will be designed in harmony with the natural setting and the surrounding development pattern as well as to the highest industry standards. E. Existing Communication Services. The proposed tower facility will comply with FCC and other applicable agency standards so as not to interfere with existing communication services in the area. F. Health Effects. The proposed tower will comply with all applicable federal, state, county, and city health standards so as not to cause detrimental health effects to persons in the surrounding area. 9.37.3. Applicability. All communication towers and antennae shall meet the minimum requirements as prescribed in this ordinance and any additional regulations adopted by the city council governing the development and construction of communication towers and antennae. 9.37.4. Definitions. A. Accessory Structure Compound. A_ fenced, secured enclosure in which a_ wireless telecommunications facility and its equipment, buildings, access roads, parking area, and other accessory devices/auxiliary structures are located. The outline of an accessory structure compound shall be accurately defined on a site plan. B. Alternative Support Structure. Any structure other than a wireless telecommunications tower, which may include, but is not limited to, buildings, water towers, light poles, power poles, telephone poles, and other essential public utility facilities. C. Antenna. An electromagnetic device, which conducts radio signals, through an attached cable or waveguide, to or from a radio transmitter or receiver. Typically, this includes “whips,” “cornucopia horns,” “panels”, and parabolic “dishes.” D. Antenna Support Structure. Any structure on which telecommunications antennas and cabling can be attached. Typically this includes steel towers with guy-wires (guyed towers); wooden, steel, or concrete single poles (monopoles); self-supporting steel towers with three or four “legs” (self- support/lattice towers); and rooftops of existing buildings or structures (such as elevated water storage tanks). (See also tower). E. Co-location. The placement of more than one wireless communications antenna by one or more telecommunications service providers on a single existing or new antenna support structure. F. Concealment Techniques. Concealment techniques are methods used to blend a wireless telecommunications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the existing City of Chelsea Zoning Code - 67 -  surroundings so as to not have the appearance of a wireless telecommunications facility. Such structures shall be considered wireless telecommunications facilities and not spires, belfries, cupolas, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for purposes of applying height limitations. Due to their height, such structures must be designed with sensitivity to elements such as building bulk, massing, and architectural treatment of both the wireless telecommunications facility and surrounding development. Concealed towers on developed property must be disguised to appear as either a part of the structure housing, a principal use, or an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed towers developed on unimproved property must be disguised to blend in with existing vegetation. Example: A tower of such design and treated with architectural material so camouflaged to resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches on its upper part (also known as a “monopine”). G.

Requests for temporary use permits for self-supporting towers shall be accepted only for sites that are already approved for a permanent tower structure. An application for a temporary tower may be made simultaneously with an application for a permanent tower. All portions of the temporary self-supporting towers and its support structures, including guy wires, shall fall within the property or compound boundaries that are approved specifically for wireless telecommunications facility use. A temporary tower shall not exceed the height of a permanent tower approved for a particular site. These regulations shall not apply to portable mobile emergency or test tower facilities. F. Design Requirements — Personal Wireless Service and Facilities. The following specific design requirements shall apply to each type of personal wireless service and facility: City of Chelsea Zoning Code - 69 -  Building Mounted Antennas. Building mounted personal wireless services shall not exceed ten feet above the building surface on which they are located. An additional one (1) foot of height may be added for every 10 feet the antenna is set back from the building parapet, to a maximum height of fifteen feet above the surface on which it is located. Building mounted antennas shall be architecturally integrated with the building design in such a manner as to be visually unobtrusive. Building mounted antennas shall be painted to match the existing building. Building mounted antenna equipment facilities shall be screened from public view. Distributed, Repeater, or Microcell Antenna Systems Distributed, repeater, or microcell antenna systems mounted on buildings within non-residential zones shall conform to the height limit of the zone within which the subject building is located. Distributed, repeater, or microcell antenna systems mounted on utility poles or other public utility facilities within the public right-of-way in any zone shall be limited in height to the height of that particular structure. Distributed, repeater, or microcell antenna systems shall be designed to minimize their visibility on utility poles or other structures. Distributed, repeater, or microcell antenna systems’ equipment facilities shall be screened from public view. 9.37.6. Standards for Approval. A permit for a wireless telecommunications facility may be approved by the Planning Commission only upon determination that the application and evidence presented clearly indicate that all of the following standards have been met. A. Location and Facility Height Permissible locations and facility heights are shown in Table 9-1. Table 9-1 Location and Facility Height (Wireless Facilities)        Zoning Districts E-1, R-1, WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS A-R, R-R, | R-2, FACILITIES PRD, PMD B-1 O-I, B-2 M-1 Alternative support structures Permitted Permitted Permitted | Permitted Co-location antennas Permitted Permitted Permitted | Permitted Use of concealment techniques (antenna support structures of any height) Permitted Permitted Permitted | Permitted Antenna support structures up to 60' in height Permitted Permitted Permitted | Permitted Antenna support structures 61’ to 200° in height Prohibited Prohibited | Permitted | Permitted Antenna support structures 201° to 260' in height Prohibited Prohibited | Prohibited | Prohibited Antenna support structures 261' in height or more Prohibited Prohibited | Prohibited | Prohibited     Towers and/or antennas utilizing alternative support structures shall not exceed 15 feet in height above the existing structure on which they are placed. “Whips,” “panels,” cornucopia horns, and parabolic “dishes” placed on alternative support structures shall not exceed 100 sq. ft. in size. B. Area and Dimensional Regulations. Lot size must conform to the minimum lot size required for the underlying zoning district. City of Chelsea Zoning Code -70-   The minimum lot size for any new freestanding wireless telecommunications facility shall be large enough to allow for the antenna support structure and ground-mounted accessory structures of the applicant and the ground-mounted accessory structures at least one additional co-locating service provider. If only a portion of a parcel is being leased for a wireless telecommunications facility, the lease parcel must be situated within the parent parcel so that the wireless telecommunications facility complies with the applicable antenna support structure setback requirements. C. Setbacks. Wireless telecommunications towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum yard requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. The use of concealment techniques does not exempt a wireless telecommunications facility from any minimum yard requirements. Towers (but not guys and accessory facilities) must adhere to additional setbacks indicated in the following table. Tower setbacks do not apply to alternative support structures. Table 9-2 Tower Setback Requirements TOWER SETBACKS When the property on which the tower is located is zoned... The setback from all property lines is... A-R, PRD, PMD 50' (for towers of any height)...(Additional setback applies if tower is adjacent to a residentially-zoned property - see (c) below.) R-R, E-1, R-1, R-2, B-1 A distance equaling the height of the tower O-I, B-2 50' (for towers of any height)...(Additional setback applies if tower is adjacent to a residentially-zoned property - see (c) below.) M-1 30' (for towers of any height)...(Additional setback applies if tower is adjacent to a residentially-zoned property - see (c) below.) Towers must be placed no closer than a distance equal to the height of the wireless telecommunications facility from any residential structure on adjacent property. 9.37.7. Co-location. A. No new antenna support structure shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that no existing antenna support structure or other structure can accommodate the applicant’s needs. B. Documentation that reasonable efforts have been made to achieve co-location shall be submitted. Applications for new antenna support structures must include an affidavit from the applicant verifying that no existing sites are available for co-location. If the owner of an approved antenna support structure refuses to allow a co-location, an affidavit shall be required that states the reason for the refusal. C. Antenna support structures less than or equal to 200 feet in height shall have the ability to accommodate at least one additional antenna, unless they would cause the height of the antenna support structure to be increased. Antenna support structures greater than 200 feet in height, if permitted, shall have the ability to accommodate at least two additional antennas. D. Co-location is not required if the use of concealment techniques is prohibitive to co-location efforts. E. The City of Chelsea may request of the owner/operator of wireless telecommunications facility permission to place weather warning equipment, such as horns and sirens, on a tower of a wireless telecommunications facility, which request may be refused by the owner/operator should such warning equipment interfere with the operation of the wireless telecommunications facility. 9.37.8. Aesthetics. The aesthetic properties of each individual wireless telecommunications facility shall be approved as City of Chelsea Zoning Code -71-  part of the site plan review process. A. Appearance. The design of the tower shall be of a type that has the least visual impact on the surrounding area. Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish so as to reduce the visibility of the structure unless other standards are required by the FAA. B. Towers and antennas shall be painted a neutral or blending color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness, unless subject to any applicable FAA standards. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting telecommunications facilities must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure. C. No signage, symbols, or advertisements may be attached to the pole, tower, or antenna. D. Camouflaged Towers. Concealed towers on developed property must be disguised to appear as either a part of the structure housing a principal use or an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed towers developed on unimproved property must be disguised to blend in with existing vegetation. Example: A tower of such design and treated with architectural material so camouflaged to resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches on its upper part (also known as a “monopine”). Towers camouflaged to resemble woody trees or indigenous vegetation in order to blend in with the native landscape will be subject to administrative review, as are other types of concealment techniques. 9.37.9. Accessory Structures. A. The design of the compound and its accessory structures shall, to the extent possible, maximize use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. B. In or adjacent to developed properties, accessory structures must be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment. Materials such as wood, brick, and stucco should be used as appropriate. The use of metal or metallic-looking materials shall be avoided in as much as shall be practical. 9.37.10. Non-vegetative Screening. A. Non-vegetative screening will be required when it is necessary to reduce the visual impact of a wireless telecommunications compound on adjacent public ways, properties or the neighborhood in which it is located. In or adjacent to developed properties, non-vegetative screening shall be provided in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding character of development, buildings, natural vegetation, and landscaping. Such screening, as required and subject to site plan review, shall have a minimum height of eight (8) feet, and may consist of one of the following: brick masonry walls, solid wood fencing, berms, or opaque barriers. All non-vegetative screening shall be properly maintained by the property owner or lessor. B. In isolated non-residential areas, alternative non-vegetative screening methods may be accepted, such as the use of earth-toned, vinyl-coated steel security fencing. C. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote, agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the non-vegetative screening requirement may be reduced or waived. D. Wireless telecommunications facilities utilizing underground vaults rather than aboveground equipment buildings may be exempted from any buffer requirements. 9.37.11. Landscaping. A. A landscaped buffer shall effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways and residential properties. B. The standard buffer shall consist of a minimum eight (8) feet wide landscaped strip outside the dark vinyl coated steel security fencing of the perimeter of the compound. The buffer strip shall be planted with an attractive combination of trees, shrubs, vines, and/or ground covers that can achieve the full height of the fence at maturity and enhances the outward appearance of the security fence. For sites City of Chelsea Zoning Code -72 -  within 1,000 feet of a residence, the site review by the Planning Commission may impose increased buffer standards to include a decay-resistant, solid wood fence, earth berms, and brick or masonry walls in addition to the security fencing. All fencing and landscaping shall be maintained by the lessor/owner. C. In isolated non-residential areas, alternative landscaping methods may be accepted, such as the use of earth toned colored, vinyl-coated steel security fencing in combination with four (4) feet of evergreen trees, shrubs, vines and/or other plantings. D. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote, agricultural, or rural locations, or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived by the Planning Commission. E. Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers located on large, wooded lots, preservation of substantial natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. F. Cellular facilities utilizing underground vaults in lieu of above ground switching gear buildings shall be exempted from any buffer requirements. G. Security Devices. The facility shall be fully secured. A minimum eight feet (8’) high, dark vinyl coated steel fence shall be installed around the entire perimeter of the compound (measured to the top of the fence or barbed wired, if applicable). Security fencing shall require screening in accordance with landscaping requirements, as defined above. Other security measures shall include locks and alarms. Approved barbed or razor wire and lighting of the compound shall be permitted, if deemed necessary to fully secure the tower compound. H. Access. Driveways and parking shall be provided to assure the operator’s access to the facility for maintenance or emergency services. In some cases, parking/access may be from an adjoining alley, public street or off-street parking area. |. Co-Location. No new tower shall be established if space is structurally, technically, and economically available on an existing tower, which would serve the area that the new tower would serve. Documentation that reasonable efforts have been made by the applicant to achieve co-location shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of this section. Towers shall be designed to maximize shared use to the greatest extent possible, given the structural and technical limitations of the type of tower proposed. In any event, co-location shall be encouraged. If feasible, each tower shall, at a minimum, be designed for double its intended use for all transmitting and receiving antennae other than microwave dish antennae. J. Removal of Obsolete Towers. Any tower that is no longer in use for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owners’ expense. The owner shall provide the building inspector with a copy of the notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations, which shall be given 90 days from the date of ceasing operations, and to remove the obsolete tower and accessory structures. In the case of multiple operators sharing use of single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations. 9.37.12. Lighting. A. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other authority for safety purposes. If lighting is required, “dual lighting” (red at night/strobe during day) shall be preferred unless restricted by the FAA. Lighting must be shielded or directed inward to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount of light that falls onto nearby properties, particularly residences. B. Basic security lighting for the compound may be permitted but shall not include any flashing lights or lights greater than 20 feet in height. This lighting shall be focused only on the compound itself and shall be directed away from any adjacent property. 9.37.13. Environmental Impact. All wireless telecommunications facilities shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act. If an environmental assessment is required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a copy of the assessment, as well as documentation of the FCC’s subsequent approval thereof, must be submitted at the time of application. 9.37.14. Safety. City of Chelsea Zoning Code -73-  A. Radio Frequency. The applicant shall be required to submit documentation that the proposed wireless telecommunications facility complies with Federal Communications Commission standards for radio frequency emissions, as adopted by the FCC on August 1, 1996. B. Structural. A professional engineer shall certify that all antenna support structures and wireless telecommunications equipment are erected and/or installed so as to comply with wind loading and other structural standards contained in the Standard Southern Building Code and the applicable technical codes established by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA/TIA 222-E “Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures”) or the Telecommunications Industry Association. This shall apply to new and modified structures and facilities. C. Security of Site. Fencing shall be required to ensure that antenna support structures and their accessory buildings are fully secured. Sufficient anti-climbing measures must be incorporated into each facility, as needed, to reduce potential for trespass and injury. A sign shall be discretely placed on the outermost structural element that indicates the name and telephone number of a person responsible for the safety and maintenance of the facility. D. Access. Provisions shall be made to provide access clearances for emergency vehicles. 9.37.15. Maintenance. A. Towers must be properly maintained. Estimated life of structure must be included in submittal information. B. Obsolete towers. In the event the use of any wireless telecommunications facility has been discontinued for the period of 180 consecutive days, the wireless telecommunications facility shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of the abandonment shall be made by the city engineer who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the wireless telecommunications facility owner regarding the issue of telecommunications facility usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the wireless telecommunications facility shall have an additional 180 days within which to reactivate the use of the wireless telecommunications facility or transfer the wireless telecommunications facility to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the wireless telecommunications facility, or dismantle and remove the wireless telecommunications facility. At the earlier of 180 days from the date of abandonment with reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any variance approval for the wireless telecommunications facility shall automatically expire. The applicant shall sign an affidavit to this effect, to be placed on file with the City of Chelsea. Section 9.38. Other Supplementary Uses Supplemental uses not covered elsewhere in this ordinance and which are generally of a nature to be incompatible with most permitted uses may be allowed in any district except the "R" and “E” districts. The location shall be approved by the Planning Commission. In addition, a complete development plan and any other information pertinent to the development or use shall be included at the discretion of the Planning Commission. Such uses may include but are not limited to the following: A. Airport or landing field. B. Commercial, recreational, or amusement development for temporary or seasonable periods. C. Sanitary landfill operation. D. Practice golf driving ranges, par three golf courses, or miniature golf courses. Section 9.39. Building Material Standards Review (Approved CCC 9/15/2017) A. The standards set out in Article 5 Section 5.74 Material Standards by District may be reviewed and modified by Chelsea Planning and Zoning Commission on an individual project. New materials are continually coming to the market place and the ability to adapt is important to developing good design. B. Requests for modification must be accompanied with accurate plans and material samples. C. A single project approval does not set a new standard for the building materials percentages set in Section 5.74. Section 9.40.

City of Chelsea Zoning Code -79-  City of Chelsea Zoning Code Intentional Blank Page - 80 -  Article 11. Sign Regulations Section 11.1. Intent The purpose of this article is to provide the minimum control of signs that ensures the protection of the public safety and general welfare. These provisions are intended to reduce the hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, prevent unsightly and detrimental development which has a blighting influence upon the community, prevent signs from reaching such excessive size or numbers that they obscure one another to the detriment of all concerned, preserve the general character and aesthetic quality of the city, and promote a positive city image which reflects order, harmony, and pride. Section 11.2. Measurement Determinations 11.2.1. Number of Signs. In general, the number of signs shall be the number of non-contiguous sign faces. Multiple non-contiguous sign faces may be counted as a single sign if all the sign faces are included in the geometric figure used for determining the sign area. A. Sign Face Area. Individual Signs. The sign face area of individual signs shall be computed by using the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. This does not include the supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets applicable regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. Multifaced Signs. The sign face area of a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are no more than 36 inches apart, the sign face area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the parcel, whichever is lower. Distance between Signs. The minimum required distance between signs shall be measured along street rights-of-way from the closest parts of any two signs. Facade Area. The facade area shall be measured by determining the area within a two-dimensional geometric figure coinciding with the edges of the walls, windows, doors, parapets, marquees, and roof slopes of greater than forty-five (45) degrees that form a side of a building or unit. Section 11.3. Exempt Signs The following signs are exempt from the requirement that a permit be obtained and shall not be counted toward any restriction regarding the number or area of signs permitted on a parcel provided they conform to the standards enumerated in this section and provided they are not placed or constructed so as to create a hazard of any kind. 11.3.1. Signs that are not designed or located to be legible from any street or adjoining property. 11.3.2. Signs of 216 square inches (1.5 sq. ft.) in size or less and signs that include no letters, symbols, logos, or designs in excess of two (2) inches in vertical or horizontal dimension, provided that such sign, or combination of such signs, does not constitute a sign prohibited by these regulations. Combination of such signs shall not exceed 10 sq. ft. at any one location or any one parcel. City of Chelsea Zoning Code - 81-  11.3.3. Signs necessary to promote health, safety, and welfare, and other regulatory, statutory, traffic control, or directional signs erected on public property with permission as appropriate from the City of Chelsea, the State of Alabama, or the United States. 11.3.4. Legal notices and official instruments. 11.3.5. Decorative flags and bunting for a celebration, convention, or commemoration of significance to the entire community when authorized by the City of Chelsea for a prescribed period of time. 11.3.6. Holiday lights and decorations. 11.3.7. Merchandise displayed behind storefront windows so long as no part of the display moves or contains flashing lights. 11.3.8. Memorial signs or tablets, historical markers, name of a building and dates of erection when cut into any masonry surface or when constructed of bronze or other incombustible materials and attached to the surface of a building. 11.3.9. Signs incorporated into machinery or equipment by a manufacturer or distributor, which identify or advertise only the product or service dispensed by the machine or equipment, such as signs customarily affixed to vending machines, newspaper racks, telephone booths and gasoline pumps. 11.3.10. Advertising and identifying signs located on taxicabs, buses, trailers, trucks, or vehicle bumpers. 11.3.11. Public warning signs to indicate the dangers of trespassing, swimming, animals, or similar hazards. 11.3.12. Works of art that do not constitute advertising. 11.3.13. Signs carried by a person. Section 11.4. Prohibited Signs It shall be unlawful to erect, cause to be erected, maintain or cause to be maintained, any sign not expressly authorized by, or exempted from, these regulations. The following signs are expressly prohibited unless otherwise exempted or expressly authorized by this article. 11.4.1. Any sign with a sign face area greater than 200 sq. ft. 11.4.2. Signs that are in violation of the building code or electrical code adopted by the City of Chelsea. 11.4.3. Any sign that, in the opinion of the city engineer, does or will constitute a safety hazard. 11.4.4. Portable signs 11.4.5. Signs with visible moving, revolving, or rotating parts or visible mechanical movement of any description or other apparent visible movement achieved by electrical, electronic, or mechanical means, except for traditional barber poles. 11.4.6. Signs with lights or illuminations that flash, move, rotate, scintillate, blink, flicker or vary in intensity or color except for "time and temperature” signs. 11.4.7. Strings of light bulbs used on commercially developed parcels for commercial purposes, other than traditional holiday decorations. 11.4.8.

City of Chelsea Zoning Code - 93 -  Article 14. Board of Zoning Adjustment Section 14.1. Appointment A Board of Zoning Adjustment is hereby established. Such Board shall be appointed as provided by Section 11-52-80, Code of Alabama, 1975, or as such may be amended, and it shall have all powers granted therein. Section 14.2. Procedure The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct of its affairs and in keeping with the provisions of this ordinance. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman or, in his absence, the acting chairman. He may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings shall be open to the public. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be public record and be immediately filed in the official records of the board. Section 14.3. Administrative Review The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that an error exists in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Planning Commission in the enforcement of this ordinance. Section 14.4. Variances To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. Section 14.5. Justification Variances to the terms of this ordinance may be granted on an individual, case-by-case basis upon a finding by the Board of Zoning Adjustment that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. Another essential factor is that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. More specifically, the board shall determine all of the following criteria have been considered. 14.5.1. The board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship, even to the extent of authorizing non-conforming uses. Where the board authorizes a non-conforming use in a district to prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors, when taken together, must indicate that the plight of the premises in question is unique in that they cannot reasonably be put to a conforming use because of the limitations imposed upon them by reason of their classification in a specific zone. 14.5.2. Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. 14.5.3. Variances should be permitted only if the ordinance has created an unnecessary hardship. Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship for approval of variances. 14.5.4. Mere financial loss of a kind, which might be common to all of the property owners in a district, is not an unnecessary hardship. 14.5.5. When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for a claim that a variance should be granted. 14.5.6. Variances should be granted sparingly and should be carefully preserved to the end that the structure of this ordinance would not disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Section 14.6. Application for a Variance An application for a variance shall be filed with the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent of the property owner on a form made available by the city clerk and shall include the following: 14.6.1. Name, Signature and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, if any. 14.6.2. Address of the property under consideration. 14.6.3. Zoning and land use of the property under consideration. City of Chelsea Zoning Code - 94 -  14.6.4. Justification for the variance in accordance with all of the criteria in Section 14.5. 14.6.5. A vicinity map showing the location of the subject property. 14.6.6. A plat, drawn to scale, showing all dimensions, property boundaries, and proposed development layout with the variance noted or highlighted. 14.6.7. The names and addresses of adjacent property owners as shown on the most recent records of the Shelby County Tax Assessor’s Office. 14.6.8. A $50.00 administrative fee is required from the applicant or agent at the time the application for a variance is made, plus the cost incurred in notification and publication. Section 14.7. Public Notice Required At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Board of Zoning Adjustment public hearing, the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall give written notice of the variance request to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States Mail, first class, postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at the addresses as submitted with the variance application by the applicant, as well as publication in a newspaper of general publication throughout the city and/or posting of such notices in four (4) conspicuous places within the city (if there is no newspaper of general circulation). Any error in the address of such notices shall not invalidate the giving of notice, provided that no more than five percent (5%) of the total number of notices given contain any such error. Such notice shall state the following: 14.7.1. The name of the applicant. 14.7.2. The location of the property. 14.7.3. The nature of the variance and applicable zoning provisions. 14.7.4. The time, date, and location of the Board of Zoning Adjustment public hearing at which said application is to be heard and considered. Section 14.8. Action on Appeals In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this ordinance, reverse or affirm (wholly or in part) or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as to what should be made and, to that end, shall have powers of the Planning Commission from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Planning Commission or other administrative official; to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance; or to affect any variation in the application of this ordinance. Section 14.9. Appeals - How Taken 14.9.1. Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be filed by any person aggrieved by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the administrative official. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days or such lesser period as may be provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the city clerk or other administrative official and the Board of Zoning Adjustment, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The code enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action was appealed. 14.9.2. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or attorney. Section 14.10. Stay of Proceedings An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the city clerk or other administrative official certifies to the Board of Zoning Adjustment (after the notice of appeal is filed by him) that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, caused imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the city clerk or other administrative official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

A-1  INDEX  CITY OF AUBURN ZONING ORDINANCE  AN ORDINANCE in pursuance of the authority granted by Title 11, Chapter 52, Articles 1 through 4 inclusive, of the 1975 Code of Alabama, to provide the establishment of districts within the corporate limits of the City of Auburn, Alabama; to regulate within such districts the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards and other open spaces, the density of population and the use of buildings, structures, and land; to repeal all existing Zoning Ordinances and to provide methods of administration of this Ordinance and penalties for the violation thereof. THE PUBLIC WELFARE REQUIRING IT, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Auburn, as follows:  ARTICLE I. TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION. Section 100. Title. This Ordinance shall be known as and may be referred to as the “Auburn Zoning Ordinance,” and includes maps of the City that depict the boundaries of zoning districts. Section 101. Legislative Intent. In enacting the Zoning Ordinance, special notice has been taken of the fact that the goals of citizens and landowners of Auburn often conflict or compete. In the light of this situation, the first consideration has been to devise technical solutions, which minimize or eliminate conflicts. This Ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate both competing interests. This has inevitably, and properly, led to some form of compromise. In arriving at these compromises, every possible consideration has been given to the public interest, individual property rights, and externalities. While compromise implies mutual concessions or losses, it also implies – and this Ordinance has been designed to provide – mutual gains and benefits. It is the goal of this Ordinance that both the burdens and the benefits it implies are rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property owners of Auburn. Every effort has been made to make uses a matter of right subject to performance criteria capable of nondiscretionary, objective administrative evaluations, thus reducing the number of times that rezoning decisions need be made. This greatly increases the potential uses or choices available to individual property owners. The rezoning decisions that conventional zoning ordinances frequently necessitate appear to reduce the certainty of protection to neighbors and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to Auburn. This Ordinance contains performance criteria intended to insure that neighbors are protected from adverse impacts. The Ordinance also contains performance criteria to protect the community’s general welfare. Zoning districts are few in number, and each has a clearly different purpose. Distinctions among zoning districts are based upon the City’s Comprehensive Plan. The districts are sized to be adequate to handle Auburn’s long-term needs and must be regularly updated as time passes. Where performance criteria severely limit the use of properties, the Ordinance has gone to considerable extremes to provide the landowners with a range of choices, flexibility, and options for development. Section 102. Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is the promotion of the health, safety, and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of Auburn by:  I-1 102.01. Giving effect to the policies and proposals set forth in the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 102.02. Providing methods to preserve and maintain a healthful environment for the benefit of present and future generations by providing standards to control the amount of open space and impervious surfaces within a development; to control the intensity of development in areas of sensitive natural resources or natural features in order to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts. 102.03. Controlling and regulating the growth of Auburn, concentrating development in areas where adequate sewerage facilities, roads, and schools can be provided, and limiting development in areas where these facilities are not and should not be provided. 102.04.

Section 304. Statement of Purpose and Intent of Zoning Districts. The following sections specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance. 304.01. Urban Core District (UC). This District is intended to serve as the retail, financial, service, historical and religious focal point of Auburn. In general, the UC provides for uses of regional, as well as local, importance. It is intended to be an area of high intensity use in which a full range of public facilities are available. Approval of proposals/applications may require collaboration between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. Occupancy in the UC is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.02 College Edge Overlay District (CEOD). This District provides additional regulations for properties within Urban Core zoning along the College/Magnolia corridors* for purposes of assuring development consistency in meeting building requirements for setback, step back, glazing, cladding materials, signage, balconies, awnings, and canopies. *Parcels fronting on College Street between Thach Avenue and Mitcham Avenue, as well as parcels fronting on Magnolia from Wright Street to Gay Street will be included in the CEOD. 304.03. Urban Neighborhood East (UN-E). This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at medium to higher densities to meet the demands exerted by downtown Auburn and Auburn University and to promote the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of a wide range of residential, commercial, and institutional uses adjacent to the urban core of the City of Auburn. The UN-E District is a development and redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character with permitted uses to serve a broad range of community needs. The nature of the UN-E District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District, requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. Occupancy in the UN-E is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.04. University Neighborhood West (UN-W). This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at high densities to meet the demands exerted by Auburn University, and to accommodate the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of residential, commercial, and institutional uses adjacent to the University campus and the urban core of the City of Auburn. The UN-W District is a development and redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character with permitted uses which serve a range of student and community needs. The nature of the UN-W District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District, requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as  III-3  parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. Occupancy in the UN-W is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.05. Urban Neighborhood South (UN-S). This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at medium to higher densities to meet the demands exerted by downtown Auburn and Auburn University and to promote the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of residential, commercial, and institutional uses adjacent to the urban core of the City of Auburn and the University campus. The UN-S District is a development and redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character. Of the three (3) Urban Neighborhood Districts, the permitted uses in this District are geared to the community as a whole, but focused on preserving and complimenting the character of the single-family residential areas adjacent to this District. The nature of the UN-S District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District, requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. Occupancy in the UN-S is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.06 Neighborhood Conservation District (NC). The Neighborhood Conservation (NC) District is intended to preserve the character of existing neighborhoods and developments under construction at the time of adoption of this Ordinance. It is designed to prevent these neighborhoods and subdivisions from becoming nonconforming under the terms of this Ordinance. This District is also intended to provide for future development of land where a NC District is deemed the most appropriate zoning classification, and a preliminary or final plat for development of the land has been approved by the Planning Commission. It is also intended to provide for in-filling of existing neighborhoods on vacant lots with single family detached dwellings as defined in Section 203 of this Ordinance. Because there are a number of different lot sizes in the Neighborhood Conservation District, the Zoning Map depicts these various areas with the letters “NC” sub-designated by a number. The number indicates the minimum lot size in thousands of square feet. For example, NC-20 indicates that 20,000 square feet is the minimum lot size for the District so designated. Occupancy in NC zones is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 304.07 Development District Housing (DDH). The Development District – Housing (DDH) is a District that is designed to promote conventional and performance single family housing and/or provide a transition between the NC and the CDD. Permitted uses in this District will be limited to conventional residential uses of low to moderate densities, outdoor recreation uses, and public service uses. Performance residential uses are permitted conditionally. At the time of enactment of this Ordinance, the DDH consisted largely of vacant or undeveloped land, but it is the intent of this Ordinance that this District have a residential character. Occupancy in the DDH is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 304.08 Medium Density Residential District (MDRD). The Medium Density Residential District (MDRD) is a District that is designed to promote redevelopment of residential properties to provide more diverse housing types at higher densities than the DDH district. The district is intended to provide a transition between the DDH and the UN and CRD districts. Permitted uses will be limited to performance residential housing types, and limited institutional, special residential, and public service uses. III-4  Occupancy in the MDRD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses 304.09 Neighborhood Redevelopment District (NRD). The Neighborhood Redevelopment District is designed to promote infill and renewal of existing neighborhoods by allowing a variety of residential uses while preserving and complimenting the character of the single-family residential areas adjacent to this District. Permitted uses include conventional and most performance residential uses with the intention of accommodating moderate densities and providing a transition between CRD-W and NC. Occupancy in the NRD, west of North Donahue Drive, is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. Occupancy in the NRD, east of North Donahue Drive, is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.10 Redevelopment District (RDD). This District is intended to promote the renewal of those transitional areas of the City of Auburn that have undergone extensive changes in land use type and density/intensity. Transition from generally low density residential land use to higher residential densities and small-scale commercial, office and institutional use has occurred in a haphazard manner, much of it prior to enactment of current zoning regulations. This District provides regulations that permit redevelopment of an urban character. It provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses. The RDD is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize transitional neighborhoods, thereby reducing the cost of growth in Auburn. The RDD may not accommodate a substantially larger population as a result of redevelopment, but the character, stability and vitality of the District are projected to improve immensely. Like the CDD, this District allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. This Ordinance, therefore, imposes standards to resolve any possible problems and eliminate negative impacts. Occupancy in the RDD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.11 Large Lot Residential District (LLRD). The Large Lot Residential District (LLRD) is a one-acre minimum single-family residential zoning district designed with the intent to provide a transition from the Rural (R) zoning district (three acre minimum lot size) to a higher intensity zoning district(s). The LLRD is a low density residential district and is more restrictive in terms of the uses permitted than the Rural (R) District. Occupancy in the LLRD is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 304.12 Rural District (R). This District is intended to protect and preserve areas of Auburn which are presently rural or agricultural in character and use. The standards developed for these areas are designed to permit development compatible with the preservation of their rural character and agricultural use, while not permanently foreclosing future development. 304.13 Limited Development District (LDD). The Limited Development District (LDD) is intended to accommodate mainly low to moderate density residential development, supported by commercial uses serving the local residents. Such commercial uses will be limited in range, scale and location; and will be subject to design standards intended to promote low-intensity commercial development that is consistent in character and appearance with surrounding residential areas. Occupancy in the LDD is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. III-5  304.14 Comprehensive Development District (CDD). This District is intended to accommodate most of the growth expected in the undeveloped areas of Auburn. It is to be provided with all public facilities (schools, sewers, water, and highways) and will allow most uses by right. It is intended to provide the zoning and capital improvements that attract development. It consists of the areas where development should logically locate as a consequence of planned public facilities and associated capital expenditures. This District provides regulations that permit development of both urban and suburban character. It provides for low- to moderate-density residential development and for necessary commercial and institutional uses. The CDD is designed to minimize the costs of extending or expanding public services. It is a planned, logical accommodation of growth and is intended to serve areas suitable for development and to avoid unsuitable areas. Uses that are so large as to be of regional importance are not permitted by right, because these uses require specialized and different evaluation and have special locational considerations, which may make a separate zoning district appropriate. Major uses, such as a regional shopping center, will be considered as conditional uses. Manufactured home parks, commercial support uses, and road service uses are permitted conditionally, and industrial uses are not permitted. The CDD allows many and varied uses while placing the emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. Segregation of uses has never provided adequate protection, especially at the boundaries of use districts. This Ordinance anticipates the likelihood – and desirability – of considerable mixing of land uses and imposes standards to resolve any possible problems and eliminate the negative impacts of juxtaposing unlike land uses. Occupancy in the CDD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.15. Corridor Redevelopment District (CRD). This District is intended to promote the renewal of the traditional auto-oriented commercial corridors of the City of Auburn. The areas with this designation were developed prior to the current zoning regulations and suffer from poor aesthetics and lack of economic diversity. This District provides regulations that permit redevelopment of a more urban or mixed-use character while protecting the economic viability of the corridor. It provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses. The CRD is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize commercial corridors, thereby reducing the cost of growth in Auburn. The CRD is not intended to accommodate a substantially larger population as a result of redevelopment, but the character, stability and vitality of the District are projected to improve. Like the CDD, this District allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. This zone, therefore, imposes standards to alleviate conflicts and eliminate negative impacts. The CRD is divided into four unique sub-districts: Corridor Redevelopment District - Urban (CRD-U), Corridor Redevelopment District – East (CRD-E), Corridor Redevelopment District – Suburban (CRD-S), and Corridor Redevelopment District – West (CRD-W). The Urban and East designations promotes more compact growth in those areas closer to the Urban Core. The Suburban and West designations promotes growth with strong aesthetic and increased design guidance. Occupancy in the CRD-U, CRD-E and CRD-S is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses Occupancy in the CRD-W, west of North Donahue Drive, is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. Occupancy in the CRD-W, east of North Donahue Drive, is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 304.16 South College Corridor District (SCCD). This District is intended to accommodate commercial, entertainment, and services uses that not only serve the local community but also the greater region due to  III-6  the proximity to the interstate highway. The district is provided with public facilities (sewer, water, and highways) and will allow most commercial uses by right. This District is not intended to accommodate residential or industrial uses. The District is intended to provide zoning and capital improvement that attract development that provides goods and services to a broad market beyond the community. The SCDD is designed to accommodate growth of commercial uses that require a higher need of access and visibility for the regional shopping and hospitality markets. In addition to the commercial uses that are permitted by right, road service uses that are geared toward a retail consumer are permitted, whereas, most other road service uses are considered as conditional uses. Since the SCDD is a primarily commercial use district, there is less need for minimizing impacts and nuisances within the district and more emphasis on access and circulation between properties and uses. 304.17. Industrial District (I). This District is intended to accommodate industrial areas that must be segregated, because of negative impacts that cannot be made compatible with other uses through the application of performance standards. The creation of this separate District for industrial use recognizes not only nuisances, but also infrastructure and operational incompatibilities between its permitted uses and those of other districts. Accordingly, the standards for this District are designed to accommodate intensive industrial uses that generate nuisances, which either cannot be handled by technology or which are nearly impossible to police. Locational criteria for this district focus on transportation, requiring that sites have access to a railroad, an airport or a major expressway. 304.18 Planned Development District (PDD). This District is intended to provide an opportunity for a land development process with the greatest flexibility available to the developer, consistent with the provisions of these regulations, and the provisions included in the master development plan for the subject property. The PDD designation may be requested and considered for application only to those properties already zoned DDH, MDRD, NRD, CDD, LDD, RDD, CRD, and SCCD. Approval of a Planned Development District (PDD) shall be based upon the approval of a master development plan (Section 505) for the site in question. The approved master development plan shall establish the allowable uses, densities, street and building configuration, open space, amenities and buffering. Uses shall be selected from those listed conditionally in Table 4-1 following a thorough evaluation of the propose location of any PDD. Following the acceptance of the master development plan, the property shall receive the PDD zoning designation. 304.19. Conservation Overlay District (COD). This District is intended to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by encouraging the conservation and enhancement of the City’s source of water supply and natural resource environment. The purposes of the district are:  1. To protect water quality in the Lake Ogletree Subwatershed;  2. To permanently preserve unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, and woodlands within the City of Auburn;  3. To offer developers and landowners alternatives to standard development of land;  4. To provide flexibility to allow for creativity in development;  5. To foster less sprawl and more efficient use of land, streets, and utilities; and  6. To permit clustering of buildings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils in order to reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential and commercial development. 304.20. Holding District (HD). This District encompasses those land which are owned or operated by governmental entities and are exempt from the regulations of this code and those lands which are set aside  III-7  for public institutional uses and the protection of vital natural resources. The purpose of the Holding District in relation to government-owned lands is to acknowledge their presence within the City Limits while recognizing that such areas are not subject to local zoning requirements. If and when any HD-designated property comes under private ownership, the Planning Commission shall assign the appropriate zoning designation. ARTICLE IV. GENERAL REGULATIONS Section 400. Introduction. The purpose of the regulations contained in this Article is to allow maximum utilization of land while insuring against detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public interest. This insurance is provided by separating the incorporated area of the City of Auburn into 20 zoning districts and permitting specified land uses within each, provided that a use meets all the additional criteria specified in this Ordinance. This regulatory approach has been termed “performance zoning,” because it permits a use to be developed on a particular parcel only if that use meets “performance” standards, which have been enacted to insure against the use causing, or having the potential to cause, the negative impacts mentioned above. The format of the regulations in this Ordinance, and particularly in this Article, differs somewhat from that of traditional zoning ordinances, because performance zoning requires that consideration be given to site parcel characteristics and the range of impacts that any land use may have. Section 401. Use Regulations. Section 402 through 407 identify the category of use and define the specific uses shown in Table 4-1 - Table of Permitted Uses. Section 408 and Table 4-1 indicate which land uses may locate by right, by conditional use, or are not permitted in each zoning district. In addition, Section 408 provides special developments standards for uses that are permitted or conditional permitted in each zoning district. Section 402. Use Categories Defined. The categories of uses utilized by this Ordinance are defined in Sections 403 through 407. The uses not enumerated in these sections are not necessarily excluded.

Nurseries are distinguished from more intensive garden center uses. 406.09. Commercial support. This use category includes uses, which support the City’s retail economy by providing merchandise distribution, storage, and repair services. These uses include beverage distributors; blacksmith shops; bulk materials or machinery storage (fully enclosed); large equipment rental/sales/service; contractors’ offices and equipment storage yards; dry cleaning and laundry plants serving more than one (1) outlet; fuel, oil, ice, coal, and wood sales; furniture cleaning plants; furniture refinishing shops; manufacturing (including the production, processing, cleaning, testing, and distribution of materials, goods, foodstuffs, and products in plants with less than 30,000 square feet of floor area or fewer than 100 employees on every shift); mirror supply and refinishing shops; monument works; ornamental iron workshops; printing plants; publishing plants; trade shops (including cabinet, carpentry, planing, plumbing, refinishing, and paneling); small engine repair as a principal use; veterinary offices with open or partially enclosed runs, yards, pens; and/or kennels; wholesale business and storage; warehouses and mini- warehouses; and all other commercial support uses. 406.10. Neighborhood Shopping Center. A commercial development site containing one or more commercial buildings, together with all required parking, landscaping, buffering, signs, drainage facilities, and other design features to accommodate the uses permitted on the site. The purpose of the neighborhood shopping center is to serve the limited commercial needs of nearby residential development. It is not intended to provide commercial services to customers from other areas of the City. Permitted uses shall include banks; garden supply stores; grocery stores or supermarkets; ice cream stores; laundries and/or dry cleaners; light mechanical repairs such as cameras, watches, or tv’s; barber or beauty shops; standard sit- down restaurants, not fast food establishments; gasoline service stations; and similar retail stores and service businesses. 406.11. Community Shopping Center. A commercial development site, which may include outparcels, containing one or more commercial buildings, together with all required parking, landscaping, buffering, signs, drainage facilities, and other design features, to accommodate the uses permitted on the site. The purpose of the community shopping center is to serve a larger market area than a neighborhood shopping center with certain categories of commodities that are less likely found in a regional shopping center, such as garden and building supplies. Permitted uses shall include office; garden supply stores; grocery stores; clothing stores; specialty food stores; dry cleaners; electronic repairs such as cameras, watches, or televisions; barber or beauty shops; standard sit-down restaurants; and similar retail stores and service businesses. (See Table 4-1). Some uses are allowed by conditional use approval such as gasoline service station and bank with a drive-thru (See Section 803). 406.12. Regional shopping center. This category includes commercial land development consisting of 500,000 or more square feet of gross floor area on one (1) lot. Section 407. Industrial Uses. 407.01. Industry. This use category includes asphalt or concrete mixing plants; bulk material or machinery storage (unenclosed); fuel generation plants; grain elevators; meat packing plants or slaughterhouses; resource recovery facilities; truck, motor, or rail terminals; dyeing plants; food processing and packing plants; lumber yards; pilot plants; scientific (e.g., research, testing, or experimental) laboratories; also, those uses listed above as commercial support, any industrial use having 30,000 or more square feet of floor area or having 100 or more employees on any shift, and all other industrial uses. IV-3   This group contains uses that have severe potential for negative impact on any uses that would locate relatively close to them. This group differs from commercial support uses in that it includes uses that require enclosed structures, which are large, tall, and unsightly, such as concrete batching plants. These uses also have severe potential for generation of odor and may involve large amounts of exterior storage; because of their scale, they are likely to have a regional impact. 407.02. Extraction and junkyard uses. This category includes junk, scrap, or salvage yards and all extraction uses. These uses create major disruptions to the area’s environment, even when carefully regulated. Dust, dirt, noise, and unsightly conditions can be anticipated. None of these areas is an acceptable neighbor in an urban environment. 407.03. Airports, Landing Strips and Heliports. This category includes any facility used for take-off, landing, storage, maintenance, and/or repair of aircraft. It also includes aviation-related activities, such as radar and communications facilities, flight schools, and cargo loading and storage areas. (Also see Section 516 Airport Overlay District)  Section 408. Uses Permitted by Right, Uses Permitted with Conditional Use Permits, and Uses Not Permitted. Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Ordinance, no building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied except in the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in this Section. The general use categories specified by Table 4-1 are defined in Sections 403 through 407. Uses permitted by right or as a conditional use shall be subject, in addition, to use regulations contained in this Ordinance, to all performance criteria, and other regulations governing yards, lot size, lot width, building area, easements, provisions of off-street parking and loading, and to such other provisions as are specified in other Articles herein. In particular, the laws of the State of Alabama and the regulations of the Lee County Department of Health regarding water supply and waste disposal shall be adhered to. Further, no permits shall be issued until approval is obtained from the Lee County Department of Health for water supply and sewage disposal, unless the premises are served by public water and/or sewage facilities. 408.01. All permitted uses and uses requiring conditional use approval pursuant to Section 803 are listed in Table 4- 1. In addition, the table notes uses for which special development standards apply, regardless of whether such uses are designated as permitted or conditional. Special development standards are listed in Section 408.02. A use listed in Table 4-1 in any district denoted by the letter “P” is a use permitted by right, provided that all other requirements of State law and this Ordinance have been met and provided that a zoning certificate has been issued in accordance with Article IX. A use listed in Table 4-1 may be permitted as a conditional use in any district denoted by the letter “C”, provided that the requirements of Article VIII have been met.

Section 409. Zoning District Performance Standards. Sections 417 and 418 delineate the standards for open space, density, impervious surface coverage, and lot area that apply in each zoning district. The purpose of these performance standards is to provide detailed regulations and restrictions by means of minimum criteria, which must be met in order to protect neighbors from adverse impacts of proposed land uses and to protect the general health, safety and welfare by limiting where uses may be established, insuring that traffic congestion is minimized, controlling the intensity of use, and prescribing other such performance criteria as necessary to implement the goals and objectives of this Ordinance. This Ordinance depends on a comprehensive performance evaluation process to insure compatibility between neighboring land uses. Section 410. Compliance. All uses and activities shall comply fully with the provisions of the following standards as a precondition of development approval. Section 411. Performance Standards. This section contains the basic standards applicable to the districts and uses allowed by this Ordinance. The standards of Tables 4-2 and 4-3 shall apply to each district and use therein. All standards must be met. Some development standards shown in Tables 4-2 and 4-3, particularly maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and impervious surface ratio (ISR), may differ from standards provided in Table 4-4 or elsewhere in this Ordinance; in all cases, the strictest standard shall apply. All tracts of land within a district may be developed to the same density factor. However, the number of units permitted per gross acre will vary from site to site due to differences in the amounts of resource protection land, but will in no case exceed the maximum gross density established in Table 4-2. The floor area ratio is the maximum amount of gross floor area of all floors of a building permitted on the site. Impervious surface ratios are calculated separately for areas and/or parts of a development site that are separated by a public road, railroad, or other feature that affects surface drainage. The base-zoning district from which they were rezoned shall govern densities, and open space ratios for uses in Planned Development Districts. When a Planned Development District encompasses property with more than one original zoning designation, the density, and open space ratio shall be derived from the calculated average figure based on the acreage within each original zoning designation. This average may be applied across the overall site, without regard for the original designation. 411.01. Building Setbacks. A. Minimum Setbacks. 1. Residential Buildings. Residential setbacks are found in Section 502, Residential Use Regulations. IV-30   2. Non-Residential Buildings. To calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure adequate light, air and privacy to abutting properties, multiply the height of the proposed building by the Angle of Light Exposure Factor for the zoning district as shown in Table 4-3. The product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the property line. If, based on this calculation, the setback required is greater than the minimum width of the required bufferyard, the setback according to the angle of light exposure factor must be used. B. Maximum Setbacks. Where lots have double frontage, the maximum setback shall apply to the frontage upon any designated corridor (Section 429). For corner properties, the maximum setback shall be measured from the property line of both rights-of-way. This setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements. Recessed portions of any proposed structure, designed for outdoor seating, dining or events shall be allowed under the requirements of this section following the review and approval of the Planning Commission. Such recesses shall be clearly illustrated on the site plan. (The rest of this page left blank intentionally.)

meeting the minimum size requirement in any district, see Section 705. 4ISR, FAR and minimum lot width shall be set by the base district from which the Planned Development is rezoned. Minimum site area for all Planned Development is ten (10) acres (See Section 203). 5 In cases where side lot lines are not parallel because the lot fronts on a curved right-of-way, minimum width at road frontage shall be as follows: 1. Curved right-of-way: 75 percent of normal width requirement 2. Subdivision cul-de-sac: 50 percent of normal width requirement. Width at road frontage shall be measured along a straight line connecting the foremost points of side lot lines. 6Uses that apply in a PDD only (refer to Table 4-1, Table of Permitted Uses and Section 503, Planned Developments) IV-35   Section 412. Natural Resource Protection Standards. A. All residential and nonresidential development shall be preceded by the identification of any environmental or natural feature described in Sections 413 through 416 and shall meet the specified standards of environmental protection. B. Site alterations, regrading, filling and clearing or planting vegetation prior to approval of the subdivision plats and/or site plans for development shall be a violation of this Ordinance. Reference in this section to “open space” is intended to mean the term as it is defined by Article II and described in Section 417. Section 413. Stream Buffer. 413.01. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of buffers to ensure that the stream and adjacent land will fulfill their natural functions; to reduce land development impacts on stream water quality and flows; and to provide for the environmentally sound use of Auburn’s land resources. 413.02. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following words or phrases shall be defined as specified below. A. Perennial stream: See Article II, Definitions—Stream, Perennial  B. Intermittent stream: A stream that flows at least six months out of a year but does not flow during part or all of the summer and may carry water during or after a rainstorm. C. Ephemeral stream: A stream channel or reach of stream channel that carries surface water runoff for short durations as a result of precipitation events. The channel bottom is always above the groundwater table. D. Best Management Practices (BMPs): Conservation practices or management measures that control soil loss and reduce water quality degradation caused by nutrients, animal wastes, toxics, sediment, and runoff. 413.03. Streams Determination. Perennial and intermittent streams are identified through site inspection by the Water Resource Management Department and/or US Geological Survey (USGS) maps. Perennial streams are those which are normally depicted on a USGS map with a solid blue line. Intermittent streams are normally depicted on a USGS map with a dotted blue line. Perennial and intermittent streams not identified on the USGS map as described herein may be added to a development site plan by the Water Resource Management Department based on the determination by a qualified professional that the stream satisfies the USGS definition for said streams. Ephemeral streams are streams assessed and determined by the Water Resource Management Department through stream delineation done on the development site as reported by a qualified professional. 413.04. Buffer description, width, and permitted uses. Stream buffers shall be required on each side of all perennial and intermittent streams as defined in Section 413.02 and further described in Section 413.03. Stream buffers width shall vary based on the size of the upstream drainage basin. Table 4.31 specifies the buffer required based on the drainage area for a particular stream above the most downstream point on the development being considered. The USGS 7.5 minute 1”:2000’ quadrangle maps, in conjunction with the Soil Survey Maps of Lee County and the City of Auburn Geographic Information System (GIS), will serve as tools to delineate the size of drainage basins and specify the corresponding buffer width. The stream buffer is comprised of three zones: Streamside Zone, Managed Use Zone, and Upland Zone. Buffer zones’ function, vegetation and permitted uses vary by zone as described in the Table 4.32. IV-36   TABLE 4.31 Stream Buffer Width Based on Drainage Area Drainage Area (Watershed) Designation Streamside Zone Managed Use Zone Upland Zone Total Buffer Width on each side of Stream < 100 acres 25 feet None 10 feet 35 feet > 100 acres 25 feet None 20 feet 45 feet > 300 acres 25 feet 20 feet 10 feet 55 feet > 640 acres 25 feet 50 feet 25 feet 100 feet  If an ephemeral stream remains after construction has been completed, and all or a portion of that stream falls within the stream buffer of an intermittent or perennial stream, then that ephemeral stream shall be revegetated on both sides of the stream in accordance with the targeted vegetation of the corresponding buffer zone. Appropriate stream bank stabilization measures shall be designed if warranted by excessive velocities in the ephemeral stream. If the ephemeral stream remains after construction and falls outside of an intermittent/perennial stream buffer, then that ephemeral stream shall be grassed and/or revegetated in accordance with the surrounding vegetation at a width of 25 feet on each side of the ephemeral stream. Ephemeral stream channels and banks shall be stabilized as appropriate for the predicted stream velocities. These measures are performed in order to preserve and protect water quality. TABLE 4.32 Stream Buffer Description and Permitted Uses Characteristics Streamside Managed Use Zone Upland Zone Function Protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem Protects key components of the stream and provides distance between upland development and the streamside zone Prevents encroachment and filter runoff from residential and commercial development Vegetative Target Undisturbed natural vegetation Mature vegetation and native trees; exotic vegetation and underbrush may be removed and maintained Lawns, gardens, shrubs, and pervious landscaping features Uses Very restricted- Permitted uses limited to: flood control structures, utility easements*, natural footpaths, crossings and approaches for paved roadways, and pedestrian paths and bikeways. Restricted- Permitted uses limited to: all uses allowed in the Streamside Zone as well as storm water best management practices (BMPs), biking and hiking paths (with natural or pervious surfaces), greenway trails, and limited tree clearing approved by the Water Resource Management Department. Restricted- Permitted uses limited to: all uses allowed in the Streamside and Managed Use Zones, as well as, grading for lawns, gardens, and gazebos and accessory structures. No septic systems, principal structures or impervious surfaces are allowed. *As deemed necessary and approved by the Water Resource Management Department  413.05. Applicability. The buffer requirements shall apply to all perennial and intermittent streams defined in Section 413.02. Buffer widths for streams are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water, landward from the top of the bank on each side of the stream. The top of bank is the landward edge of the stream channel during high water or bank full conditions at the point where the water leaves the stream channel and begins to overflow onto the floodplain. IV-37   All properties shall be subject to the buffer width requirements except those properties that are an existing lot of record and/or included on an approved preliminary subdivision plat and the lot or lots cannot meet the requirements described in this Section. (Effective date 5/02/06 pursuant to Ordinance Number 2389) 413.06. Minimize Intrusion. Any uses allowed in Table 4.32 shall be designed and constructed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the stream buffer and to minimize clearing, grading, erosion, and water quality degradation. 413.07. Land in the Stream Buffer. Land in stream buffers shall not be used for principal structures. All new platted lots shall be designed to provide sufficient land outside of the stream buffer to accommodate primary structures. Stream buffers should be delineated before streets and lots are laid out to minimize buffer intrusion and to assure adequate buildable area on each platted lot. Land within the stream buffer can serve to meet the minimum lot size requirements. 413.08. Setback Requirements. For all lots within a development requiring a stream buffer, setbacks can be 100% within the stream buffer. 413.09. Buffer Impact. When the application of the buffer zones would result in the loss of buildable area on a lot (See Section 203 for definition of “lot”) that was recorded prior to the amendment of this ordinance, modifying the width of the buffer zones may be allowed, through an administrative process, as determined by the Water Resource Management Department. Modification and mitigation of the stream buffer width are also available to landowners or developers of newly platted lots or subdivisions where there are exceptional situations or physical conditions on the parcel that pose practical difficulty to its development and restrict the application of the regulations of this ordinance. There must be proof of such circumstances by the landowner. The landowner or his designated representative proposing any of the impacts shall prepare and submit for approval a written request and a site plan showing the extent of the proposed impact and must specify a proposed mitigation technique. Mitigation techniques are included in Section 413.10. The Water Resource Management Department and other appropriate city staff members shall review and render a decision on any buffer encroachment and mitigation technique with regard to the stream buffer requirements. Amendment to the stream buffer width may be allowed in accordance with the following criteria:  A. The proposed encroachment and mitigation is in accordance with the purpose and intent of this section of the ordinance. B. The proposed lot and structure conforms to all other zoning and development regulations. C. Encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utility. D. The landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable written statement justifying the need for the buffer impact. E. The landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable mitigation plan in accordance with cited mitigation techniques. F. Attention has been given to maintaining natural vegetation and eliminating run-off. In no case shall the reduced portion of the buffer area be less than the width of the Streamside Zone (25 feet). IV-38   413.10. Stream Buffer Mitigation Techniques. The following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation of buffer impact. A. Installation of Structural BMPs. The installation of an on-site structural BMP (i.e. bioretention, extended detention/retention, rain gardens, stormwater wetlands, etc.) will allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site. The structural BMP shall be designed to achieve pollutant (nutrients, herbicides, pesticides, sediment and other illicit discharges) removal to the maximum extent practicable. The BMP shall remain outside the Streamside Zone. A detailed BMP design plan must be submitted to the Water Resource Management Department for approval along with a long-term maintenance plan. B. Controlled Impervious Surface. The landowner may commit to and provide a specific site development plan that limits the overall site impervious surface ratio equal to or less than 25%. C. Open Space Development. The landowner may submit a specific site development plan which preserves an undisturbed, vegetative area on-site or near the development site as open space equal to 200% of the buffer encroachment area. The open space preserved must promote water quality protection. D. Stream Restoration: The landowner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area the condition of which is determined to be qualified for restoration by the Water Resource Management Department on a 1:1 basis in linear feet of stream. This restoration shall include stream bank improvements and Streamside and Managed Use Zone re-vegetation. E. Stream Preservation: The landowner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments within the city limits at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple and absolute title of the land to the City. F. Wetland Restoration: On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (2 acres of wetland for each acre of disturbed area), the landowner may provide a combination of the preservation and/or restoration of wetlands with protective easements, and the implementation of structural or non- structural BMPs to achieve pollutant removal to the maximum extent practicable. G. Greenways: The landowner may allocate and donate open space within the city limits through fee simple to the City of Auburn for preservation and use as common open space. H. Wider Buffer Widths: A developer may add additional widths to buffer areas where encroachment occurs in other areas on a development site and may obtain an acre for acre credit based on the stream buffer zone impacted. A 2:1 credit could be obtained by determination of the Water Resource Management Department in the event additional streamside buffer is set aside for encroachment of the managed use and upland stream buffer zones. I. Other Mitigation Techniques: Other creative mitigation techniques and plans may be considered by the Water Resource Management Department. 413.11. Vegetation Preservation. The buffer shall provide for the preservation and enhancement of natural vegetation or planting. No live vegetation may be removed from the Streamside and Managed Use Zones for preparation of land for uses permitted in Table 4.32 unless approved by the Water Resource Management Department. The Water Resource Management Department may grant approval of the removal of exotic vegetation (i.e. privet, kudzu, etc.) provided that a vegetation restoration plan is submitted and approved prior to the disturbance of the vegetation. The purpose of such plan is to ensure that native vegetation is restored to the Streamside Zone. Where a developer or lot owner removes live vegetation from the buffer strip, in violation of this section, the Water Resource Management Department shall require native vegetation of reasonable diameter in size to be planted so as IV-39   to create a buffer area which is in compliance with this section. A vegetation restoration plan must be submitted and approved by the Water Resource Management Department prior to restoration. 413.12. Vegetation Restoration Plan. A vegetation restoration plan shall include the following information:  A. Scaled map of lot showing buffer delineation (copy of the survey is acceptable). B. Square footage of the actual area disturbed or proposed disturbed area. C.  Proposed vegetation to be removed from the buffer. D.  Proposed location, number, and species of plants to be planted in the disturbed area (See list of plant species). E.  Type of ground cover to be placed in the disturbed area (i.e. mulch, pine straw, etc.). F. Proposed planting schedule and deadline for completion of restoration activities. 413.13. Buffer Delineation. The following buffer delineations are required:  A. Stream boundaries including each buffer zone must be clearly delineated on all grading plans, subdivision plats, site plans and any other development plans. B. The outside boundaries of the Managed Use Zone of the stream buffer must be clearly marked on- site by flagging or fencing prior to land disturbing activities. C.  The outside boundary of the Managed Use Zone must be permanently marked at highway stream crossings. D.  Stream and buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all surveys and recorded plats and noted on individual deeds. E.  Stream buffer requirements must be referenced in homeowners association documents. 413.14. Approved Permits. Where a landowner or his representative obtain permits from Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) or the U. S. Army Corp of Engineers for proposed impact to the stream or stream buffers then these approved mitigation impacts and plans would supersede the applicable requirements of these sections of the ordinance. The regulations that these permits do not affect shall be applicable to the proposed development site. Section 414. Reclamation of Undeveloped Land. In the event that construction of a development has not begun in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, or has not been completed within one year of initiation, said development shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission at its next regular meeting following the expiration of the one-year period. At this meeting, the Planning Commission shall determine whether or not reasonable progress toward completion of the development is being made. Evidence of reasonable progress toward completion may include, but shall not be limited to, installation of streets, utility lines and stormwater management facilities; laying structural foundations; and completion of any stage of a development approved under a staging plan pursuant to Section 802.09(A). However, the clearing and grubbing of land, in the absence of other improvements, shall not by itself constitute evidence of reasonable progress. Upon a determination that reasonable progress is not being made, the Planning Commission may require the owner of the development site to restore the land to the same condition that existed prior to the initiation of the development. If such restoration is not feasible, the City Engineer and the Planning Director shall determine and prescribe an acceptable condition or degree of reclamation; at the very least, the site shall be sodded or planted in grass, and appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent or eliminate soil erosion. In all cases, restoration activities shall be consistent with appropriate Best Management Practices as recommended by the Alabama Forestry Commission, the IV-40   Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and/or the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Section 415. Floodplains. Development within or affecting a floodplain shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 7.5, FEMA Requirements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 415.01. Permanent open space. All such areas shall be permanent open space. No uses or improvements other than those permitted herein shall be permitted in any area consisting of floodplain as defined by this Ordinance. 415.02. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted within the floodplain as a matter of right:  A. All uses that are permitted in designated open spaces. B. All uses that are classified as agriculture, nurseries, and outdoor recreation. C. Piers, bridges and bridge approaches, and picnic shelters, so long as the building permit application shows that a licensed engineer has certified that such structures are designed to withstand the forces exerted by the 100-year flood event at that location. Section 416. Steep Slopes. Development on steep slopes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 4.3.1.1 – Review and Approval of Construction Best Management Practices Plans of the Auburn Water Resource Management Design and Construction Manual. All steep slope areas, as determined by the Water Resource Management Department, shall be identified on the Construction Best Management Practices Plan and on any subdivision plats. Section 417. Open Space. The open space requirements of Table 4-2 and this Section shall apply to residential development only. Land that is required by this Ordinance to remain as open space may be used for the recreation, agriculture, resource protection, amenity and other purposes specified in this Section. Open-space land shall be freely accessible to all residents of a development, with the exception that agricultural land uses shall be permitted to restrict access to that land to those solely engaged in agricultural pursuits. Open space shall have qualities making it useful to residents of the development for either passive or active recreation, and will be developed to serve that purpose; or shall serve an important visual role in separating the development from existing public ways or from other existing or potential developments; or shall be of value in dividing the development into coherent sub-areas. Non-recreational buildings, except those related to agricultural uses permitted under Section 417.01(C) shall not occupy open-space land. 417.01. All developments required by this Ordinance to provide open space shall meet the following requirements. A. Land designated as open space shall be maintained as open space and may not be separately sold, subdivided, or developed, and no structures shall be built on such land, except as provided below. All such properties shall be owned and maintained by the developer, owner of the development site, homeowners association, or other private entity. B. An open-space plan shall be submitted as a part of the application for a site plan or subdivision approval. This plan shall designated and indicate the boundaries of all open-space areas required by this Ordinance. The plan shall:  1. Designate areas to be reserved as open space. The specific design of open-space areas shall be sensitive to the physical and design characteristics of the site. 2. Designate the type of open space, as established in this Section that will be provided. 3. Specify the manner in which the open space shall be perpetuated, maintained, and administered in accordance with Section 417. IV-41   C. The types of open space that may be provided to satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance, together with the maintenance required for each type, are as follows:  1. Natural areas are areas of undisturbed vegetation or areas replanted with vegetation after construction. Woodlands and wetlands are specific types of natural areas. Natural watercourses are to be maintained as free flowing and devoid of debris. Stream channels shall be maintained so as not to alter floodplain levels. 2. Agricultural uses specified in Section 403.01. 3. Garden plots are the division of open space into plots for cultivation as gardens. 4. Recreational areas are areas designed for specific, active recreational uses having minimal requirements for structures, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, softball fields, and golf courses. An enclosed structure shall be permitted in a recreational area only where it directly supports a specific facility and does not require off-street parking. Recreational areas shall be accessible to all residents of the development. 5. Greenways are linear green belts linking residential areas with other open-space areas. These greenways are encouraged to designate developed bicycle paths, footpaths, bridle paths, fitness trails, or other similar development. Inter-connecting the greenway system between residences and recreational areas in encouraged. 6. Commonly owned lawns consisting of grass with or without trees. D. Open space shall be appropriately located and large enough to address the open space characteristics cited throughout Section 417. 1. No dwelling unit shall be located more than 750 feet from designated open space. The Planning Commission may waive this distance requirement where the developer proposes a major recreational facility which will occupy at least 50 percent of the required open space for the development. No more than ten (10) percent of the dwelling units in the development may be occupied before this facility is completed and available for use. Where intervening non-recreational properties separate a dwelling unit from an open space area, the Planning Director may require an easement or other means of access for non- motorized traffic to avoid the need for pedestrians to cross or travel on roads carrying vehicular traffic. 2. No parcel of property, or portion thereof, less than 40 feet wide and 7,500 square feet in size shall be counted toward the designated open space requirement. Open space areas containing paved or stabilized paths for pedestrians and/or bicycles shall be exempt from this requirement if such paths are part of a comprehensive circulation system serving a portion of the development. 3. All open space shall be easily visible and freely accessible. 4. The following shall not count toward fulfillment of designated open space requirements:  a) Platted lots for residential use or designated sites for manufactured homes or recreational vehicles;  b) Easements for roads, driveways or any other use which is not consistent with the purposes of open space as established in this Section;  IV-42   c) Required bufferyards in subdivisions where such bufferyards are located inside residential lots;  d) Parking areas, including planter islands, planter strips, and peninsulas, containing required landscaping; e) Public or private right-of-way; f) Private roads and driveways; g) Areas of required spacing between structures, manufactured homes or recreational vehicles; h) Areas which have been cleared of vegetation, excavated, filled, or otherwise altered from their natural state unless such alteration is consistent with the proposed use of the open space parcel;  i) Any development site (as established by a site plan) containing a clubhouse or a non-recreational use including, but not limited to, office, restaurants, gift shops, and groundskeeper storage buildings;  j) Any other areas which the Planning Director finds to be inconsistent with the intent of this Section. In addition, no lake, pond, or other permanent water body shall constitute more than 25 percent of the total open space required for the development. No golf course shall constitute more than 60 percent of the total open space required for the development. 417.02. Preservation of open space. Open-space areas shall be maintained so that their use and enjoyment as open space is not diminished or destroyed. Where open space is to be provided within a subdivision, such areas shall be designated by creating separate parcels within the perimeter of the plat. These parcels shall be labeled as to their intended use, and the plat shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility. Where open space is provided within a development site, which is the subject of a site plan, and is under different ownership than the rest of the site, it shall nevertheless remain part of the development site pursuant to Section 802.11. Unless the site plan is modified or terminated in accordance with Section 802.08, the open space areas shall be used only as provided in Section 417. The site plan shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility. Open-space areas may be owned, preserved, and maintained as required by this Section by any of the following mechanisms or combinations thereof:  A. Common ownership of the open space by a homeowner’s association, which assumes full responsibility for its maintenance. B. Deed-restricted private ownership that shall prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision of the open-space land and provide the maintenance responsibility. This arrangement shall be noted on the site plan and/or subdivision plat. Full and proper legal documentation shall be submitted to the Planning Director prior to commencement of development activities. Section 418. Land Use Intensity Classification and Bufferyards and Structure Height. All land uses that are permitted by this Ordinance have been assigned a land use intensity class designation. This classification system separates uses on the basis of the type and degree of “nuisance” or negative impact they are likely to impose on land uses adjacent to them. IV-43   Bufferyards are required to protect one class of use from adverse impacts caused by a use in another class or to ameliorate the impact two uses in the same class may have on one another. Bufferyards between two uses in the same land use intensity class are not required in this Ordinance for Classes V-XI, because the principal intent is to buffer residential uses (found only in Classes I-IV) from nonresidential uses. However, the Planning Commission may require bufferyards between two uses of the same intensity in Classes V-XI or between two uses of different intensity where bufferyards are not required by the Ordinance if it appears that problems will result from placing unlike land uses side by side without a bufferyard. This regulation benefits both the developer and the adjoining landowner(s), because it allows the developer several options from which to choose in developing the property, while insuring each neighbor adequate protection regardless of the developer’s choice. Each land use is listed in one or more use intensity classes. A use must meet all the standards specified for that use in Table 4-4. The standards that apply to the highest intensity class for a use shall be the maximum intensity permitted for that use. There are standards that set maximum density, impervious surface ratio, floor area, and height. Steeples, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, and similar ornamental/architectural features may exceed structure height by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning district. Chimneys, ventilators, utility service structures, solar panels, flag poles, fire escapes, stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit by 12 feet. Exclusions from structure height are parapet walls, (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend. Exclusions shall not exceed in cross sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building. Exclusions from structure height shall not include accessory rooftop structures such as greenhouses, pigeon houses, enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and similar structures. Un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools and jogging tracks shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does not exceed the height limit of the respective zoning district. Section 419. Land Use Intensity Class Standards. In keeping with the concept that performance should be the relevant measure of any land use regulations the following Section classifies uses according to their respective impacts (all uses within a use class are considered to have an equal impact on neighboring uses). A developer may develop at an intensity that will minimize nuisances to neighbors or provide a denser bufferyard, if the land is developed at greater intensities. The impacts of greater intensity may include greater impervious surface coverage, with associated increased runoff, heat generation, reduced percolation, and open space, increased bulk and height of buildings, increased traffic with associated noise and congestion, signs and exterior lighting visible from neighboring property, late hours of operation, and other nuisances. Thus, for example, an office use on any lot may meet the standards of Intensity Classes V, VI, VII, VIII, or IX (See Table 4-4). The range of intensity classes open to a use does not affect whether it can locate on its lot, but only how it can develop on that lot. Performance standards are specified for each intensity class; exceeding any single standard in an intensity class moves a use to the next higher intensity class. In the event that a use does not appear in the next higher intensity class, it may not exceed any single criterion in the highest intensity class in which it is listed.

Towers for mechanical equipment or smoke, which shall not exceed 16 feet above roof line of principal building. f. Water tanks and standpipes. g. Steeples, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, and similar ornamental/architectural features may exceed structure height by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning district. Chimneys, ventilators, utility service structures, solar panels, flag poles, fire escapes, stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit by 12 feet. Exclusions from structure height are parapet walls, (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend. Exclusions shall not exceed in cross sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building. Exclusions from structure height shall not include accessory rooftop structures such as greenhouses, pigeon houses, enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and similar structures. Un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools and jogging tracks shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does not exceed the height limit of the respective zoning district. Section 420. Bufferyards. 420.01. Purpose of Bufferyards. The bufferyard is the buffer together with the planting required thereon. The bufferyard requirements of this Ordinance are designed to minimize nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public road. The purpose of the buffer is to separate different land uses from each other in order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions. In addition to creating a separation, a buffer determines the building setback for all performance developments, except where other setbacks are more restrictive. A structure in a performance development may require a setback greater than the width of the bufferyard, depending on the height of the structure. This determination shall be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 502.03. IV-47   The purpose of the planting is to create a visual separation between uses and to enhance the beauty of the City. This is accomplished through preservation, protection, and planting of trees, particularly those trees recognized herein as canopy and understory trees. The intent is to derive all the benefits of having trees, shrubs, and other plant materials. Among the benefits are: minimizing temperature elevation, reducing noise and wind reduction, reducing stormwater runoff and flooding, preventing soil erosion, producing of oxygen, fostering air quality through carbon dioxide absorption, providing shelter and food for birds and other wildlife, and softening the visual impact of development from public view and adjacent property. All these benefits contribute to a higher quality of life and enhance the appeal and economic value of both residential and business properties of the City. 420.02. Bufferyard Application. This Ordinance requires that bufferyards be provided between uses in all districts except in the Urban Core (UC) District, Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) District, Neighborhood Redevelopment District (NRD), the Industrial (I) District, and the Neighborhood Conservation District. Bufferyards between uses in these zones are not required except in cases where single-family residences occur on land abutting development in UC, UN-E, UN-W, UN-S, NRD, or I zoning districts (See Tables 4-5 and 4-7). In addition, property located in an Industrial District that has frontage along a designated corridor (See Section 429) must comply with the thoroughfare frontage bufferyard requirements (Section 429.06) and a 10-foot wide bufferyard with two (2) canopy trees per 100 linear feet is required for all development adjacent to all streets in the Industrial District. Planting materials are specified in Section 426. Conventional subdivisions shall also be exempt from bufferyard requirements. Where bufferyards are required between uses and zoning districts, they shall adhere to the buffer width requirements shown on Tables 4-5 through 4-7 and the number and types of planting specified in Section 426. The requirements of this article shall be met for all development sites and developments as defined in Article II. This includes vacant, redeveloped or developed sites that require a zoning certificate, that involve changes in land use category as defined in Sections 404 through 408, or that are subject to a conditional use permit. Sites that are nonconforming as per Article VII of this ordinance and cannot physically meet the requirements of Article IV will be subject to Minimum Acceptable Bufferyard requirements of Section 707. 420.03. Location of Bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or right-of-way, but may include easements, at the discretion of the Planning, Water Resource Management, and/or Engineering Services Departments. 420.04. Use of Bufferyards. A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation; it may contain unpaved walkways or trails, provided that: (a) no required plant material is eliminated; (b) the specified width of the bufferyard is maintained; and (c) all other regulations of the Ordinance are met. In no event, however, shall the following be permitted in bufferyards: playing fields, stables, swimming pools, basketball courts, tennis courts, parking spaces or merchandise display. No accessory structures other than signs authorized under Article VI shall be permitted in the bufferyards. No impervious surfaces shall be permitted in a bufferyard except sidewalks, paved driveways or access roads that may cross a bufferyard in providing vehicular or pedestrian access to a public street. In approving such access points, the Planning Director shall determine: (a) that no more are proposed than necessary for the safety and convenience of persons entering and leaving the development site; and (b) that the access points have been designed so as to minimize the interference with the purposes of the bufferyard. 420.05. Ownership of Bufferyards. Bufferyards constitute an integral part of a development site, and may not be subdivided, sold, dedicated, or otherwise conveyed separately from the development site of which they are a part. The City shall not approve any development plan in which a required bufferyard or any portion of a required bufferyard lies on land, which is not part of the development site. 420.06. Responsibility for Bufferyard. All bufferyards, in their entirety, are the responsibility of the owner(s) of the development site on which they are located. No required bufferyard shall be divided by a boundary between different development sites. Bufferyards within performance subdivisions shall be dedicated to and maintained by a homeowners’ association or equivalent organization; such dedication shall be indicated on the final plat prior to recording. Where a required bufferyard is located on common property, said common property shall be owned by the homeowners’ association. IV-48   Where a required bufferyard crosses a privately owned lot, a bufferyard easement of the required width shall be created on the lot, said easement being held by the homeowners’ association. Where required bufferyards are absent, destroyed or in need of maintenance, and a homeowners’ association does not exist or is inactive, individual property owners shall be responsible for their respective shares of the bufferyard. Fines assessed under Section 909 may be used by the City to provide the required landscaping. Bufferyards on common property are the joint responsibility of all property owners within the development site, who shall be assessed equal shares of any City expenses incurred in restoring such bufferyards. 420.07. Maintenance of Bufferyard Areas. All buffer areas and plant materials shall be maintained by the owner, occupant, tenant, and/or respective agent of each such bufferyard, so that the purpose and effect of the bufferyard is not diminished. The following minimum maintenance activities are required:  A. Replacement of plant materials destroyed by any cause. In the case any trees or shrubs are destroyed by natural causes, plant size, in terms of caliper, height, and gallon, as the original planting must be used as a replacement. If trees are removed or destroyed by the willful act of the property owner, occupant, tenant, contractor, and/or respective agent of each, replacement trees of a greater caliper than the original planting may be required as determined by the Planning Director. B. Repair and/or replacement of fences and walls that deteriorate or are damaged by any cause. C. Restoration of bufferyards that are altered by erosion, construction, or other causes. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section shall be deemed a violation of the Ordinance. Violators will be given written notice of the violation and permitted 15 days to correct the violation or submit a landscape plan and planting schedule before a citation is issued. Thereafter, each day shall be considered a separate offense and shall be punishable by the maximum fine established by the City Council of Auburn. The Planning Commission, as part of Conditional Use Approval may select a more restrictive bufferyard than the one required in Table 4-5, 4-6, or 4-7. 420.08. Bufferyard Requirements. Bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the buffer and type and quantity of planting materials. The type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard and structure type option are specified in Sections 426 through 428. A structure type is a wall, fence or berm erected to satisfy bufferyard requirements. The structure type requirements of a bufferyard requiring such may be satisfied by any of the options illustrated. The options within any bufferyard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness in attenuating the impact of adjoining uses. Figures 4-2 and 4-3 graphically indicate the structure type options for certain types of bufferyards (See Tables 4-5 through 4-7). Sections 426 and 427 specify species and size of plant materials and recommended minimum planting areas. Plant materials identified in Section 426 shall satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance. Any variation from plantings in Appendix A will be reviewed by the Planning Department staff in conjunction with consultation with the City Arborist. Appropriate landscaping materials for bufferyards include but are not limited to, turf grass, trees, shrubs and seasonal color, as well as stone, rocks and mulch. Where mulch is used, the area must be kept free of weeds. Section 421. Determination of Buffer Width. To determine the width of a buffer required between two (2) adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed:  A. Identify the land use category of the proposed use by referring to Sections 404 through 408. B. Identify the use category of the land use(s) adjacent to the proposed use by on-site survey. C. Identify the land use intensity class of all adjoining land uses by referring to Table 4-4. The City will supply this information. IV-49 http://www.auburnalabama.org/planning/ZoningOrdinance/Figures%204.pdf  D. Determine the buffer required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by referring to Tables 4-5 through 4-7. E. Determine the street classification of adjacent streets by using Appendix K and Appendix L in the Engineering Design and Construction Manual, for use in Table 4-7. F. Calculate the required setback based on the building height in accordance with Section 502.03. Tables 4-5 through 4-7 specify the widths of the buffer required between adjacent existing land uses and streets. Buffer width averaging shall be permitted along individual property lines as long as the overall width is maintained. The width of the buffer shall not be less than five (5) feet in any location. The buffer widths cited constitute the total buffer required on the subject property based on the nature of the adjoining land use. The Planning Commission, as part of Conditional Use Approval may select a more appropriate buffer than the one(s) required in Table 4-5, 4-6 or 4-7.

Structure Type Option 1 is required for this bufferyard; however, the structure type may be waived in exchange for a 20% increase in required understory and shrubs. 6. A 10-foot bufferyard with two (2) canopy trees per 100 linear feet is required in the Industrial District for all development adjacent to all streets. Section 422. General Landscaping Requirements. 422.01. Landscaping Requirements. This Section details the general planting required on a particular development site. A tree inches per acre system shall be used to determine the number and types of trees required on a development site. Table 4-8 specifies the required inches per acre and the required number of shrubs based on the size of the development site. The procedure for calculating the number and types of trees required on a development site is as follows:  A. Determining the Total Tree Inches Required on a Development Site. To obtain the required number and type of planting materials, find the tree inches that correspond with the acreage of the development site. If the acreage of the development site is not a whole number, round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the total tree inches. Multiply the tree inches by the actual acreage of the development site. Round all numbers to the nearest whole number. This number is the total inches of trees to be planted on the development site. If the property abuts a conventional residential subdivision, see Section 426.03 for additional tree inches to be added to the total inches of trees calculated. B. Determining the Minimum Number of Canopy and Understory Trees. Before determining the number of canopy and understory trees, a 60:40 ratio (canopy tree inches to understory tree inches) shall be applied to the total tree inches. Once tree inches for each type have been determined, the tree inches will be converted into the number of trees to be required on the site. Canopy trees: Multiply the total inches of trees by sixty percent (60%) to get the tree inches to be devoted to canopy trees. To convert the tree inches to actual tree count, the inches for canopy trees should be divided by 2, which is the minimum caliper for canopy trees. The quotient is the number of canopy trees to be planted on the development site. IV-51   Understory Trees: Take the total tree inches and multiply it by forty percent (40%) to get the tree inches to be devoted to understory trees. To convert the inches to actual tree count, the inches for understory trees should be divided by one (1), which is the minimum caliper for understory trees. This number is the actual number of understory trees to be planted on the development site. Again, this number may be diminished by any applicable tree preservation credits (see Section 427). EXAMPLE: 1.5 Acres × 53 inches (tree inches for 2 acres) = 79.5  round to 80 inches of trees  80 × 60% = 48 inches 48 ÷ 2.0 caliper = 24 canopy trees  80 × 40% = 32 inches 32 ÷ 1.0 caliper = 32 understory trees  The owner would be required to plant 24 canopy trees and 32 understory trees for a total of 56 trees. If the owner decides to plant all canopy trees, he would plant 40 canopy trees and no understory trees on the development site. C. Minimum Standards. An owner shall be allowed to exceed the minimum number of trees on a development site as long as the total required tree inches have been met. The total tree inches required on a development site may be met by planting all canopy trees, but not by planting all understory trees. The maximum number of understory trees shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the total tree inches. D. Shrubs. The number of shrubs to be planted on the development site is found on Table 4-8. The number of shrubs is determined by the size of the development site. If the acreage of the development site is not a whole number, round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the number of shrubs per acre. Then multiply the number of shrubs per acre by the actual acreage of the development site. The product is the number of shrubs to be planted on the development site. Example: 1.5 × 84 (shrubs for 2 acres) = 126 shrubs  E. Landscaping Near Utilities. Canopy trees shall not be placed within 10 feet of existing or proposed underground utilities or on designated utility easements. 422.02. Street Frontage Landscaping Requirements. Required buffer width (See Table 4-7) Canopy Trees inches (per 100 feet) Understory Trees inches (per 100 feet) Shrubs (number of) (per 100 feet) 10 feet 3 inches 3 inches 8 15 feet 4 inches 4 inches 10  Sites with narrow street frontages, in proportion to the total acreage, may be granted a waiver by the Planning Director or his designee. The applicant is required to request the waiver in letter form with the submitted landscape plans. Existing trees located in the street frontage buffer area may receive credits if the trees are protected in accordance with Section 429. The required number of canopy tree inches must be installed, unless the Planning Director, or his or her designee, deems that the canopy tree will conflict with utilities. In such cases, the total number of tree inches may be installed using understory trees. Example: A street has a linear frontage of 250 feet and requires a 15 foot buffer. Using the table above, they would be required to have at least five (5) 2-inch canopy trees, ten (10) 1-inch understory trees and 25 shrubs. This would equate to 20 tree inches in the bufferyard including 10 canopy and 10 understory tree inches. Using the tree inch IV-52   method the applicant could use larger trees to reduce number of total trees required. If the applicant used 4-inch canopy trees and 2-inch understory trees he or she could install three (3) canopy trees and five (5) understory trees. Furthermore, the applicant could install five (5) 4-inch canopy trees and not be required to install any understory trees. Should a street master tree plan be implemented for a particular street which the development site fronts; the plantings from the street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for that particular frontage. 422.03. Residential Buffer Landscaping Requirements. Additional planting materials shall be added to the landscaping requirements for property that abuts a conventional subdivision. Twenty (20) tree inches per 100 linear feet of buffer area shall be added to the inches per acre requirements for any property lines abutting conventional residential development. The 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to determine the number of canopy versus understory trees to be planted. Shrubbery shall be provided between plantings at thirty-five (35) shrubs per 100 feet. Planting materials for a residential buffer shall be installed in the buffer area along the property line(s) abutting a conventional residential subdivision. Under no circumstances, can these inches be allocated to other areas on the development site. Development sites which are separated from conventional subdivisions by the railroad right-of-way are exempt from this requirement. 422.04. Off-Street Parking Landscaping Requirements. Wherever a bufferyard required under Section 420.08 overlaps or coincides with a parking area as defined in this Section, the bufferyard shall take precedence; planting required under this Section shall be placed in another location. Existing canopy, understory, and shrub species may be counted as contributing to the total landscaping required, provided they are located within areas addressed by this Section. The type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this Section are specified in Section 426, Plant Materials. Landscape areas shall be provided in the interior parking area to break the expanse of pavement, provide visual relief and minimize temperature elevation from the expanse of asphalt. Landscape areas shall consist of planter islands, planter strips, or peninsula types. In order to count toward the off-street parking landscape requirements, a planter island, planter strip, or peninsula shall have a minimum area of three-hundred four (304) square feet with a minimum width of nine (9) feet (hereafter referred to as contributing landscape areas). Peninsulas may be designed within or adjacent to the interior parking area. The square footage of each planter island, planter strip or peninsula within the parking lot must be shown; all contributing landscape areas should be designated on the landscape plan by shading or otherwise differentiated from any non-contributing landscape area. Foundation landscaping (landscaping immediately adjacent to building) shall not be considered interior parking area landscaping. Figure 4-1 graphically illustrates the area that constitutes the interior parking area and the landscape area types. The total area provided for off-street parking landscaping shall comply with one of the following options:  Option 1: One (1) contributing landscape island is required for every sixteen (16) parking spaces in a parking lot. The requirements of this Section shall apply to all off-street parking areas containing twelve (12) or more paved parking spaces. If an existing parking lot is expanded or improved to add twelve (12) or more spaces, it shall comply with the off-street parking landscaping requirements of this ordinance within the expanded or improved portion. Option 2: A minimum of 10% of the interior parking lot shall be landscaped. The boundary of the interior parking area must be shown on the landscape plan. The interior parking lot area is that area inside of the parking lot curb or edge of pavement consisting of parking spaces, drive aisles, driveways and immediately adjacent areas including all landscape areas. The maximum distance in any direction between islands and peninsulas shall be one hundred eighty (180) feet and one hundred twenty (120) feet for planter strips measured from the closest landscaped planting area curb edge. IV-53   A minimum of one (1) canopy tree shall be required for and must be planted in each contributing landscaped island or peninsula regardless of the tree credits received. Larger contributing landscape areas shall require one (1) additional canopy tree for each additional three hundred four (304) square feet of area (i.e. a six hundred eight (608) square foot contributing landscape area requires two (2) canopy trees. Any additional landscaped areas, beyond the required number, may be planted with understory trees and/or shrubs. One (1) canopy tree per one-hundred (100) linear feet shall be planted in continuous planter strips. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs and/or other ground covering. In some instances, these requirements of Section 420.07 may require planting materials in excess of those required by Section 422.05. Existing canopy trees located elsewhere on the development site shall not count as contributing to the landscaping requirement for parking areas. All planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion by the installation of curbing or other wheel stops. Parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more than two and a half feet, as long as curbing or other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of the landscaped area. The City of Auburn Planning Department and/or Planning Commission may vary the minimum off-street parking landscaping requirements if specific circumstances and/or site conditions warrant such action. Under no circumstances can the landscaped areas be less than ninety (90) square feet, with a minimum width of five (5) feet. The type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this Section are specified in Section 426, Plant Materials. 422.05. Placement of Plants and Structures. The exact placement of required plants and structure types shall be the decision of each user; however, no less than 40% of the ‘general landscape’ material installed on a development site must be located in a buffer area when bufferyards are required. Per the International Fire Code, Section 507.05, ‘a 3- foot clear space shall be maintained around the circumference of fire hydrants.’ There should be no obstruction preventing easy coupling of fire hoses or turning on the hydrant. The hydrant should be visible from all approaches. Items such as shrubs, brush, posts and fences should not be placed or kept near fire hydrants. Any remaining landscaping outside of the required bufferyards and parking landscaping should be placed to soften the facades of buildings. The plantings should be placed near the foundations of the buildings, if possible. Additionally, all developments must submit a Landscape Plan showing landscaping required by this Ordinance. See Figures 4-2 and 4- 3 for structure types. 422.06. Structures. The Planning Director may waive a structure (Type 1 or 2) requirement on a performance residential development in the Redevelopment District (RDD), Comprehensive Development District (CDD) and Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) zoning districts. The waiver will be considered where structures are required to abut certain outdoor recreational uses, specifically parks, picnic areas, play fields and playground. The waiver request must be accompanied by a letter of justification from the applicant. 422.07. Reuse of an Existing Site. For landscaping requirements for the reuse of an existing building, refer to Section 707 of this Ordinance. The landscape requirements will be determined by the adjacent land uses and the location of the proposed new use.

Tree Preservation Credit. In order to encourage the conservation of existing trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, credit will be given for specimen trees and any other trees that are successfully preserved and protected in accordance with tree protection methods specified in Section 425. In order for a tree to qualify for tree credit, it must be identified on the Landscape Plan, protected during land disturbance as required in Section 425 and meet the all minimum standards outlined in this Ordinance. The credit allowed for a freestanding tree shall be the actual Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of the tree saved. Only trees with a DBH measurement of four (4) inches or greater and spaced appropriately for future growth shall be eligible for tree credit. Tree credit shall only be given to trees with main trunks located on the development site. No tree credits shall be applied toward meeting the tree inches allocated to the Street Frontage and Residential Buffers, unless the trees are located in these buffer areas. If during construction, trees that are shown on the Landscape Plan to be preserved are cleared or removed, then replacement trees shall be required equal to the total inches of credit given for the trees in accordance with this Section. Section 424. Specimen Trees or Stands of Trees. When making a determination on the identification of specimen trees, the following standards shall be adhered to:  A. Any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: (1) Large Hardwood Trees: 24-inch DBH or larger, such as oaks, hickories, poplars, etc. (2) Large Coniferous Trees: 30-inch DBH or larger, such as pines, cedars, etc. (3) Understory Trees: 4-inch DBH or larger, such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc. B. A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum health standards:  (1) A life expectancy of greater than 15 years. (2) A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than 20% radial trunk dieback. (3) No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). (4) No major insect or pathological problem. C. A tree of a lesser-size than specified in this Section can be considered a specimen tree if it is:  (1) A rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. (2) Specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project. (3) A contiguous grouping of trees, which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the City. Determination is based upon the following criteria: (a) A relatively mature, even-aged stand. (b) A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature. (c) A stand of historical significance. (d) A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. IV-59   In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional credit will be given for specimen trees which meet the standards outlined in Section 428. In addition, the specimen tree must be successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved shall be twice the normal credit. Section 425. Tree Protection. 425.01. Purpose. The purpose of this section shall be to establish methods of protecting trees and their root systems during the land development process. 425.02. Methods of Tree Protection. Root space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the land development process. The root system of trees easily goes beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. Disturbances within the critical root zone can directly affect a tree’s chances for survival. To protect the root zone, the following methods are suggested:  A. Tree Protection Area – A tree protection area for all trees within the R.O.W., and any trees proposed to remain within 25 feet of any proposed grading, clearing, tree removal or construction shall be established by physical barriers prior to any land disturbance and maintained until such work is completed. All tree protection areas shall be defined by at least a concentric circle centering on the trunk with a radius equal in feet to the number of inches of the tree’s diameter at breast height. In no cases shall the radius be less than 8 feet. Example: A 12” DBH tree would have a 12’ radius (24’ diameter) tree protection area. B. Protective Barriers – Protective tree fencing shall be installed at the edge of the tree protection area prior to any land disturbance. Where feasible, fencing should extend beyond the drip line of the trees being protected. Fencing shall be a minimum of 4 feet in height, consisting of orange polyethylene laminar or chain link fabric secured with metal T-posts, or other means approved by the City Arborist. C. Signage – The placement of “Tree Protection” and/or “Keep Out” signage shall be attached to the physical barrier at all times. The location and quantity of signage shall be on all sides and convey the intent of the tree protection area and barriers. D. Construction Activity – Construction activities (such as grading, parking, storing equipment or materials, trenching, digging, washing or rinsing, etc.) shall not be allowed within the tree protection area. Utilities, irrigation lines or any underground fixture shall be routed around the tree protection areas. Necessary installation through the tree protection areas shall be accomplished by boring under the root system at a minimum depth of 24 inches. E. Other acceptable Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Tree Protection (See BMPs for Trees found in the Appendix). Section 426. Plant Materials. Sections 426 and 426.01 specify the plant materials and standards that must be met in order to satisfy the requirements of Sections 420 through 421 (bufferyards), 422 through 422.03 (general landscaping), 422.04 (off-street parking), and 707 (nonconforming bufferyards). 426.01. Plant Material Specifications. A plant materials matrix designating the breakdown of the tree types (Appendix A of this Ordinance) shall be used to determine which plant materials may be used to satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance under specified conditions. Any variation from plantings in Appendix A will be reviewed by the Planning Department staff in conjunction with consultation with the City Arborist. The vertical axis of the matrix classifies plant materials by type: canopy trees, understory trees, evergreen trees, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs. These plant types correspond to the plant types specified by the sections of this Ordinance which require planting. IV-60   It shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or property owner to select species from Appendix A that are appropriate to the locations in which they will be planted, and to maintain them so as to meet the intent of this Ordinance. All plant materials shall meet minimum standards of caliper, fullness of form, height, root ball and vigor as described by the American Association of Nurserymen standards published in the current edition of American Standards for Nursery Stock. In the event of inclement weather or mitigating circumstances, landscape material may be bonded in accordance with procedures established by the City of Auburn Planning Department. 426.02. Minimum Plant Size. Unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this Ordinance, all plant materials shall meet the following minimum size standards:  MINIMUM PLANT SIZE AND TYPE Plant Material Type All Plantings Canopy Tree       Single Stem 2 to 2 ½ inch caliper and 12’ height      Multi-Stem Clump 25 gallon AND 8’ height      Evergreen Canopy 25 gallon AND 6’ height Understory Tree*       Single Stem 15 gallon AND 6’ height      Multi-Stem Clump 15 gallon AND 6’ height Shrub 3 Gallon AND 18 inches high Ground Cover 1 Gallon AND 6 inches high  Notes: Unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this Ordinance, all plant materials shall meet the following minimum size standards: All plants should meet American Standards for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1-1996). All minimum height requirements listed shall be planted height. Balled and burlap or field grown materials that meet caliper and height requirements and ANSI standards are acceptable. *No more than 50% combined may be crepe myrtle and/or Bradford pear in any landscape. Section 427. Minimum Planting Areas. In order to provide sufficient growing areas for planted urban trees, the following minimum planting areas are recommended:  1. Canopy Trees – 304 square feet of pervious root zone 2. Understory Trees – 90 square feet of pervious root zone  Section 428. Landscape Plan Submission Requirements. In the interest of improving the landscape design, approval, installation and inspection process, landscape plans shall be required as part of the site plan approval process. If tree credits are desired, the Landscape Plan shall consist of a three phase plan: a Tree Survey Plan (Section 428.A), a Tree Protection Plan (Section 428.B) and a Tree Replacement Plan (Section 428.C). If tree credits are not desired, the landscape plan shall consist solely of the Tree Replacement Plan (Section 428.C). A preliminary landscape plan showing bufferyard widths and items 2 and 3 from the Tree Replacement Plan is required with the Development Review Team (DRT) submittal. Unless otherwise stated, the final landscape plan shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit. Order of Submittal: Prior to issuance of a clearing and grubbing permit: 1. Tree Survey Plan 2. Tree Protection Plan IV-61   With Development Review Team (DRT) submittal, a plan showing: 1. Bufferyard widths 2. An outline of the parking area used for calculating 10% of the parking area, if using Option 2. 3. The size of the landscape islands, planter strips and peninsulas (if applicable) and their distances from the nearest planted areas. Prior to issuance of a building permit: 1. Tree Replacement Plan A. The Tree Survey Plan. The Tree Survey Plan shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan noting the following information:  (1) A survey plan showing all trees, including specimen trees and specimen stands of trees, that shall be preserved and shall count toward meeting the tree inches requirements. The plan shall indicate the location, size and species of all trees to be preserved. Only trees with a DBH of four (4) inches or greater are eligible for tree credit and shall be inventoried. (2) Sampling methods may be used to determine inventory data for forested areas over two acres. (3) All critical root zones must be shown on the Survey. The critical root zone will typically be represented by a concentric circle entering on the tree’s trunk with a radius equal in feet to one (1) times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. B. The Tree Protection Plan. The Tree Protection Plan is a detailed plan designed to protect and preserve trees before, during, and for a period of two years after construction. The Tree Survey and the Tree Protection Plans shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a clearing and grubbing permit, preferably with the engineering certificate. The Plan shall include the following specifications:  (1) The location, size, species, and critical root zone of all trees to be preserved on site or within the R.O.W. (2) All tree protection areas and methods of protection including, but not limited to, tree fencing, retaining walls, signage, etc. ; details of all permanent tree protection methods. (3) Locations of all existing and proposed structures, paving, driveways, detention areas, etc. (4) Locations of all existing and proposed utility lines and/or easements, including the locations for any boring sites for underground utilities. (5) Limits of clearing and grubbing, grading, and any other land disturbance that may affect tree protection areas. (6) Calculations showing proposed credit for existing trees to be preserved, including any credit proposed to apply to specific bufferyard requirements, if any. (7) Additional information as required on a case-by-case basis or as requested by the Planning Director or City Arborist. C. The Tree Replacement Plan. The Tree Replacement Plan (otherwise referred to as a Landscape Plan) is intended to fill the gap between the preserved trees and the remaining tree planting requirements of the bufferyards. The Tree Replacement Plan shall include the following:  (1) The project name, street address, date, scale, North arrow and the name and phone number of the person preparing the plan, IV-62   (2) An outline of the parking area used for calculating 10% of the parking area, if using Option 2. (3) The size of the landscape islands, planter strips and peninsulas (if applicable) and their distances from the nearest planted areas. (4) The location, size, species, and critical root zone of all trees to be preserved and replanted on the development site or within the R.O.W. Location of shrubs is also required. Unless otherwise approved by the City Arborist and/or Planning Director, all trees selected for replanting must be on the City’s Permitted Plant List (see Appendix A). Plants selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders, or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. Standards for transplanting should be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication Tree and Shrub Planting Manual or similar publication; for plant material quality specifications, reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60, 1973); for information on tree species site requirements, reference the Manual of Woody Landscape Plants (Michael Dirr, Stipes Publishing). (5) Locations of all existing and proposed structures, paving, driveways, sidewalks, detention areas, etc. (6) Locations of all existing and proposed utility lines and/or easements, including the locations for any boring sites for underground utilities. (7) Calculations showing proposed credit for existing trees to be preserved, including any credit proposed to apply to specific bufferyard requirements, if any. (8) The planting schedules along with proposed plant names (botanical and common), quantity, size, spacing, any special planting notes, and planting details. This shall include a matrix showing the required and provided tree and shrub quantities by type (canopy, understory and shrub) and size. (9) Large shrubs may be included in the Tree Replacement Plan, but should not be used for the purpose of meeting the tree inches requirement for the development site. (10) The plan shall especially respect sight triangles and sight distances at all intersections. 428.01. Certified Landscape Plan. Landscape plans shall be prepared and certified by a Landscape Architect, Certified Landscape Professional, Licensed Landscape Designer or Urban Forester with specifications for such plan contained therein. Other licensed professionals (e.g. architects, engineers, etc.) may be authorized by the Planning Director to prepare the landscape plans, provided that they demonstrate competence to the satisfaction of the Director. Where necessary, these plans can be drawn in a conceptual manner to maintain conformance with the Zoning Ordinance, while omitting the specifics of placement until final landscape plan approval. Section 429. Corridor Overlay Area Regulations. 429.01. Purpose and Scope. Recognizing the special nature of certain thoroughfares and the direct and indirect impacts of the appearance of these roadways and their importance to the local economy, this Section sets forth regulations that will help insure that development in these critical areas is visually pleasing and economically viable. Henceforth, as parcels are developed or redeveloped along designated corridors, the following bufferyard and landscape requirements shall apply. IV-63   429.02. Areas of Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all lots, parcels and tracts that have any frontage upon the rights-of-way of any street with a classification of arterial or collector, as designated in Appendix K and Appendix L in the Engineering Design and Construction Manual. Property located in the Rural (R) District and Industrial (I) District are exempt from these regulations, except for the bufferyard requirements for Industrial (I) zoned property, as specified in Section 429.06. In addition, any property developed as single-family residential shall be excluded from the requirements of this Section. 429.03. Submission Requirements. All design elements required by this Section shall be illustrated or described within the application materials prepared for the review of staff and the Planning Commission. Any submission made without such requirements shall be deemed incomplete. Incomplete submissions shall not be considered for inclusion on Planning Commission agendas. 429.04. Site Considerations. All site plans shall be developed so as to preserve, where possible, any existing significant vegetation. 429.05. Building Materials and Design Review. The Planning staff shall review submissions for their general compatibility with existing conditions and public improvements according to the process for conditional uses outlined in Article VIII. A. Exterior Building Materials. All building cladding materials shall be described in the application and shown on elevation drawing submitted with the site plan. Building facades and accessory buildings visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic shall consist of natural materials such as wood, stone, and manufactured products such as brick, stucco, architecturally decorative concrete block, single-lap horizontal cemetitious siding with offsetting vertical joints (maximum seven (7) inch exposure), cemetitious simulated cedar shake (exposure on shake), or other such materials as may be approved after the review by the Planning Commission. All structural supports (i.e., columns) for vehicular canopies shall be clad in one or more of the same materials as the building facades. Exposed metal with architectural metal finishes (i.e., Alucobond or similar type of materials) may only be used as architectural trim and accents. B. Sign Design. The location of freestanding signs shall be illustrated on the site plan. Sign materials shall be coordinated with the exterior cladding of the structures. 429.06. Bufferyards and Setbacks. On all developments, the owner or developer must provide the required setback and the required buffer area (see Section 502.02 and Section 422) or minimum buffer areas described below, whichever is greater. In cases where adjoining developments have the same land use intensity classifications, the minimum buffer area shall be provided except where developments share common walls or otherwise result in zero- lot line construction. The planting materials installed in the buffer areas must meet the specifications referenced below. In those cases where a conditional use is requested for an existing structure, only the required frontage bufferyard shall be required. Developments in the Urban Core (UC) District and the Urban Neighborhood West (UN- W) District east of North Donahue Drive are exempt from the bufferyard requirements. A. Bufferyard Requirements. When there is no conflict with the required front setback, a 15-foot buffer shall be installed along the entire thoroughfare frontage. The minimum side and rear buffers shall be five (5) feet wide. These buffer areas shall contain planting material in accordance with Section 422, General Landscaping Requirements. The development site is also subject to Sections 422 through 428. For property within an Industrial district, the thoroughfare frontage buffer area shall contain 16 tree inches per 100 feet of corridor frontage. The 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to determine the number of canopy versus understory trees to be planted. Shrubbery shall be provided between plantings at twenty (20) shrubs per 100 feet. The Planning Director may grant waivers to portions of the side and rear buffer areas, in terms of square footage and planting materials, to be relocated to other areas on the development site. The IV-64   applicant shall submit a request along with a landscape plan showing how the proposed buffer areas will be relocated. See Section 422.04 for Off-Street Parking Landscaping requirements. B. Garages, Car Washes and Service Bays. All garages, car washes or other service bays shall be located at least 40 feet from the front property line and all garage/car wash/service bay openings shall be oriented at not less than right angles to the primary public street frontage. C. Dumpsters and all other refuse collection devices shall be located behind the front plane of the primary structure and shall be fully screened from public view. 429.07. Fences and Screening. A. Lot areas within which repair of vehicles of any type occurs shall be screened from public view. Storage areas of vehicles that are visibly damaged or under repair shall be similarly screened. B. Utility meters, air conditioners and other mechanical units shall not be located on any plane of the primary structure that faces a designated corridor and shall be screened from public view. Screening shall be architecturally designed or of a material similar in quality and appearance to other areas of the building façade. For example, a parapet wall may be used to screen rooftop equipment. Effective screening should not call attention to itself, but quietly complement the building. C. No type of wire fabric fencing material shall be used forward of the front plane of the primary structure. Fences in the front yards shall not exceed four (4) feet in height. 429.08. Awnings and Canopies. Rigid or fixed awnings and canopies must be maintained and kept free from dirt, mildew and tears. Worn, faded or torn awnings and canopies shall be replaced. Section 430. Transportation Impact Report. Transportation impact reports shall be prepared in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 4.1, Traffic Impact Study Requirements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. Section 431. Clear View of Intersection Streets. Development at intersecting streets shall provide a clear view and be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 5.3, Intersection Design Elements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. Section 432. Traffic Management. 432.01. Curb Cuts. Design and construction of curb cuts shall be in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 5.2, Roadway Design Elements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 432.02. Access for Lots of Record and Redevelopment. In the interest of public safety, lots of record, as defined by this Ordinance, shall be afforded vehicular access at the direction of the City Engineer. This access may take the form of a curb cut directly onto a public right-of-way or may be limited to cross-access via an adjoining lot. The City reserves the right to adopt access plans for thoroughfares in rapidly redeveloping areas in order to facilitate traffic management and public safety. The Planning Commission and City Council shall approve such plans. 432.03. Acceleration/Deceleration Lanes. Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be provided by the developer at the direction of the City Engineer. Such improvements must be designed and constructed to city, county or state standards. Design and construction of deceleration lanes shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.3 Intersection Design Elements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. IV-65   432.04. Cross-Access Requirements. Adjoining lots with frontage upon collector or arterial roads may be required to provide cross-access to adjacent properties in the interest of accommodating the curb-cut requirements, public safety and facilitating vehicular traffic. Such access shall be required at the discretion of the City Engineer. Shared driveways, cross access driveways, connected parking lots, and service drives shall be recorded as an access easement and shall constitute a covenant running with the land. Operation and maintenance agreements for these facilities should be recorded with the deed. 432.05. Median Cuts. Center medians are designed and constructed both for traffic safety and aesthetic considerations. Such public improvements are constructed at great expense to the public and, therefore, any alteration of the existing or planned roadway medians shall be allowed solely at the discretion of the City Council and only where such alteration is in the interest of public safety. Where such alterations are allowed, the entire cost shall be borne by the applicant. The improvement of other medians or similar traffic control devices in proximity to the proposed development may be required in consideration for any allowed median alteration. 432.06. Additional Right-of-way. Additional right-of-way required by a specific governmental plan for the improvement of a given existing or proposed roadway shall, where possible, be divided equally between adjoining property owners on both sides of the existing roadway, and shall be dedicated to the City. IV-66   ARTICLE V. DETAILED USE REGULATIONS Section 500. Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to specify the detailed regulations, including bulk, layout, setbacks and lot area, which apply to specific land uses. Standards over and above those imposed by other sections of this Ordinance are necessary for certain land uses which, although permitted as of right in certain districts, have characteristics that might have negative impacts on nearby uses without these additional regulations. This Article also specifies the regulations applicable to temporary and accessory uses, and it details the off-street parking and loading requirements of permitted land uses. Section 501. Standards Applicable to Certain Uses. In addition to compliance with other regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the following standards are required of the specific uses enumerated below. 501.01. Renovation, Adaptive Reuse, and Preservation of Structures. Because there may be value to the community in the renovation, reuse and preservation of structures, and because these actions serve the public interest, renovation, reuse, and preservation of structures are encouraged in all zoning districts. A. In addition to a site plan required pursuant to Section 802, each proposed renovation, reuse or preservation of an existing structure shall include a floor plan showing the internal use of the structure. B. It is anticipated that the renovation, reuse, and preservation of existing structures will involve difficulties with maximum densities in some zoning districts, bufferyard requirements and off-street parking. Where these conditions occur, the Planning Director may impose such standards as fencing, screening, and planting as he/she deems appropriate to buffer existing adjacent properties. The Planning Director shall, in the case of higher densities and off-street parking, make such recommendations to the Planning Commission as he/she deems reasonable in supporting the concepts of renovation, reuse, and preservation of structures in the City of Auburn. 501.02. Voluntary Dedication of Property for a Public Purpose. No existing lot shall be reduced in area or dimension below the minimum requirements applicable to such lot under the provisions of this Ordinance, except that when a lot is reduced in dimension or total area by 20 percent or less by the voluntary dedication by the owner and acceptance of a portion of such lot by the City for a public use, the lot shall be considered to contain the dimensions and area it contained prior to such dedication. However, for purposes of measuring compliance with setback requirements of this Code, the dimensions and area of such lot as it exists after the voluntary dedication shall apply. 501.03. Limitations on Animals. A. No person shall keep or maintain in connection with any residential dwelling unit more than three (3) dogs aged six (6) months or older, except in the Rural (R) District. B. The keeping or maintaining of horses, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, fowl or any other such animal shall be prohibited within the stock district. The stock district shall be established by the governing body and shown on a map on file in the Planning Department. Inside and outside of the stock district, the keeping of chickens is allowed, provided:  1. the minimum lot size of the property is 10,000 square feet  2. the principal use of the property is a single-family dwelling  3. the number of chickens does not exceed:  V-1   a. four (4) on lots 10,000 square feet to 19,999 square feet  b. six (6) on lots 20,000 square feet or greater  4. the chickens are kept in an enclosure or fenced area such as a henhouse, chicken coop, chicken tractor, etc. at all times  5. the chicken enclosure or fenced area is a minimum of six (6) square feet per chicken  6. the chickens are not kept in any location on the property other than in the backyard (the rear yard of the principal structure)  7. the covered enclosure or fenced area is a minimum of 10 feet to any property line of an adjacent property and 30 feet from neighboring dwellings, church, school, or place of business  8. the enclosures are kept in a clean, dry, odor-free, neat, and sanitary condition at all times  9. the chicken owner takes necessary action to reduce the attraction of predators and rodents and the potential infestation of insects and parasites  Roosters and the slaughtering of chickens are strictly prohibited inside of the stock district. It shall be unlawful to engage in the breeding of chickens or the production of fertilizer for commercial purposes. It is unlawful for the owner of any chicken to allow the animal(s) to be a nuisance to any neighbors, including but not limited to: noxious odors from the animals or their enclosure; and noise of a loud and persistent and habitual nature. Prior to construction of the chicken enclosure, a site plan shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to Section 804. Outside the established stock district, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, fowl or any other such animal may only be maintained on lots of three (3) acres or more in the Rural (R) District. Horses may be maintained only outside of the established stock district on lots of two (2) acres or more with a limit of one (1) horse per acre. C. No person shall breed or maintain any wild animal or reptile that, in the opinion of the Environmental Services Director, poses a threat to human safety in Auburn. Excluded from this restriction are zoos, pet shops, animal shelters, medical or scientific facilities, or other locations where the showing or maintenance of such animals is a permitted use under the provisions of this Ordinance. 501.04. Moving of Buildings. No structure shall be moved from one development site to another unless such structure shall, at the new location, comply with all applicable provisions of this Ordinance. 501.05. Broadcast/TV/Radio Tower Use Regulations. A. General Regulations and Requirements. All requirements for site plan approval, as set out in Article VIII, shall be met at the time of application for site of new broadcast towers. B. Safety/Structural Design of Towers. All broadcast towers must comply with requirements as set out in the latest edition of the EIA-222 code “Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures,” as amended, published by the V-2   Electronic Industries Association and all other applicable structural safety standards, building and technical codes having jurisdiction, so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. C. Security. A chain link fence shall be installed around the perimeter of the compound, with a minimum height of eight (8) feet as measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire, if applicable). Such fence is to be located on the perimeter of the compound unless otherwise approved as part of the site plan submitted with the application of site plan approval. Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound. Climbing pegs shall be removed from the lower 20 feet of all broadcast towers. D. Lighting Restrictions. There shall be no lighting on any tower except when required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In cases where the FAA or FCC does require a tower to be lighted, any such lighting shall be the minimum necessary to comply with federal regulations. Written documentation of any FAA or FCC directives to light a tower differently than provided herein must be submitted with the site plan application. Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity, shall not be directed or reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than ten (10) feet. E. Maintenance. The owner of a broadcast tower shall be responsible for maintaining the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening, buffers, security and other installations required by this Section, and by any other applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, statutes or conditions of approval imposed by the City of Auburn or its authorized representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site. F. Landscaping. Broadcast towers constructed in conjunction with a principal structure (i.e. radio/TV station) shall comply with all bufferyard and landscape requirements as set out in Article IV. Towers constructed as stand-alone facilities shall, in addition to the bufferyard and landscape requirements set out in Article IV, provide the following general landscaping directly outside the required fencing:  1. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of eight (8) feet tall when planted, placed a minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 20 feet apart. 2. A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches high at planting placed in front of the tree line. 3. All plant material shall be xeriscape tolerant. 4. Preservation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fenced area may be substituted for the bufferyard and landscape requirements if it screens the compound from the view of adjacent development and rights-of-way. The Planning Director shall make determination of appropriate screening. G. Abandoned Facilities. Any broadcast facility that ceases to be used for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense. The owner of the facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the FCC of the intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing to remove the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural condition. In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required V-3   to remove its facilities within the one hundred and twenty (120) day period prescribed above. At such time as all providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their facilities located thereon, the owner of the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process as set forth herein. H. Area and Dimensional Requirements. The following area and dimensional regulations shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section:  1. Minimum Lot Area: Determined by setback requirement. 2. Minimum Setbacks: Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger parcel, setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site). Maintenance/equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed. 3. All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence. Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound. 4. Bufferyard Requirements: See Article IV, Section 420.08. I. Height and Location Restrictions. In regard to the height and siting of all broadcast facilities and their associated structures the following regulations shall be observed:  1. No broadcast tower site boundary shall be located closer than 200 feet to any residence. 2. No tower shall be located less than a distance equal to its height, as measured from the base of the tower, from any Neighborhood Conservation (NC) zoning boundary. Any new towers so located shall further be restricted to a monopole or self-supporting design. 3. No tower shall exceed a height of 300 feet. 4. Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it shall be sited behind the front plane of said structure. Property located in the Rural District (R) shall be exempt from this provision. 501.06. Telecommunications Towers. A. Application and Justification. All requirements for site plan approval, as set out in Article VIII, “Development Approval Process”, shall be met at the time of application for siting of new telecommunications towers. In addition to meeting the general requirements for site plan approval, the following information shall be provided when applying for approval of a communication tower:  1.

Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity shall not be directed or reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than ten (10) feet. G. Maintenance. The owner of a telecommunications tower shall be responsible for maintaining the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening, buffers, security and other installations required by this Section, and by any other applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, statutes or conditions of approval imposed by the City of Auburn or its authorized representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site. H. Landscaping. In addition to the required bufferyards as determined by standards set out in Article IV, Section 420.08, the following general landscaping shall be provided directly outside the required fencing:  1. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of eight (8) feet tall when planted, placed a minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 20 feet apart. V-6   2. A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches high at planting placed in front of the tree line. 3. All plant materials shall be xeriscape tolerant. 4. Preservation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fenced area may be substituted for the bufferyard and landscape requirements if it screens the compound from the view of adjacent development and rights-of-way. The Planning Director shall make determination of appropriate screening. I. Abandoned Facilities. Any wireless telecommunications facility that ceases to be used for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense. The owner of the facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the FCC of the intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing to remove the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural condition. In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required to remove its facilities within the 120-day period prescribed above. At such time as all providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their facilities located thereon, the owner of the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process as set forth herein. J. Area and Dimensional Requirements. The following area and dimensional regulations shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section:  1. Minimum Lot Area: Determined by setback requirement. 2. Minimum Setbacks: Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger parcel, setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site). Maintenance/Equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed. 3. All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence. Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound. 4. Bufferyard Requirements: See Article IV, Sections 420.08. K. Height and Location Restrictions.

Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it shall be sited behind the front plane of said structure. This provision shall not apply in the Rural (R) District. L. Pre-Existing Towers. Any telecommunications tower or telecommunications antenna for which a permit has been properly issued shall hereafter be considered a non-conforming use subject to the provisions of Article VII of this Ordinance. The purpose and intent of this Section is to minimize the proliferation of new towers and promote the co-location of new antennas onto existing towers. Any communications antenna locating on a pre- existing properly permitted telecommunications tower subsequent to adoption of this Section shall be exempt from the restrictions of Article IV of this Ordinance when the provisions below are met:  1. If structural strengthening is necessary to accommodate co-location, the tower type shall remain the same as previously permitted. 2. There will be no increase in the total height or type of lighting of the facility, including the tower, antennas and all other associated facilities. 3. All setback and buffer requirements applicable to the existing tower, at the time its permit was issued will continue to be applicable to such tower. The Planning Department shall permit such facilities through administrative review and approval. M. Exemptions. The following wireless communications facilities shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section:  1. Amateur radio antennas and receive-only antennas not more than 60 feet in height, and satellite earth station antennas two (2) meters or less in diameter, shall be exempt as provided for in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 when no supportive tower is to be constructed. 2. Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by public emergency agencies or government agencies. 3.

The Planning Director shall make determination of exemption of any such facilities exceeding the foregoing dimensions. Section 502. Residential Use Regulations. This Section specifies the minimum lot dimensions and other requirements for each type of residential unit permitted by this Ordinance, except in the Neighborhood Conservation District (NC). The following structures shall be allowed to project into or be constructed in any minimum required yard as follows: awnings and canopies, roof overhangs and balconies not to exceed three (3) feet; bay windows, not to exceed two (2) feet; clotheslines; driveways and their curbs, fences, walls, and hedges may be constructed in minimum yard areas, provided that their installation does not violate any other provision of this Ordinance. Uncovered decks of no more than 30 inches in height may extend to within five (5) feet of the property line. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to allow encroachment of any feature into a required bufferyard. V-8   When a lot size exceeds the minimum permitted area, all other standards applicable to the minimum lot area shall nevertheless apply. The figures specified in the tables of this Section are expressed in terms of square feet, feet, or a ratio, whichever applies. 502.01. Conventional subdivisions. A conventional subdivision consists of single-family dwellings on individual lots and requires no public or community open space. A conventional subdivision is characterized by division of the entire subject parcel into lots. Table 5-1, Lot Area, Setbacks and Maximum Impervious Surface and Parking Requirements for Conventional Subdivisions, specifies the minimum standards for conventional single-family subdivision lots of various sizes.

The minimum lot size of a Neighborhood Conservation (NC) District varies and is a function of the character of that district as of the date of enactment of this Ordinance. The subscript following the "NC" in each row of this tables designates the minimum lot size in thousands of square feet (as the district is designated on the official zoning map). Thus, the minimum lot area in a district designated NC-80 is 80,000 square feet. 2For lots fronting on a curve, see the City of Auburn Subdivision Regulations, Article IV, Section (E)(2). Width at road frontage shall be measured along a straight line connecting the foremost points of the side lot lines. 3Maximum impervious surface ratio. See Section 517 for minimum standards for flag lots      502.02. Performance Residential Developments. The purpose of a performance residential development is to provide innovative development types that make efficient use of land and public facilities, and/or to protect natural features addressed in Sections 412-417. Performance residential developments may contain one or more of the housing types that are specified in this subsection subject to the overall density standards established in Table 4-2. For purposes of calculating density, the development site shall include all platted lots, together with road, drainage facilities, utility sites and any other common property within the perimeter of the subdivision plat, regardless of whether or not such facilities will ultimately be dedicated to the City. Such developments shall contain the minimum amount of open space specified in Table 4-2. Prior to approving the final plat, the Planning Director shall verify that all parcels or tracts not intended for use as residential lots are clearly delineated on the plat as to size and dimension. The purpose, ownership, and responsibility for maintenance for each parcel or tract shall be noted on the plat. Unless specifically accepted by the City Council, the City of Auburn shall not be responsible for maintenance and/or repair of any common facility or properties. Performance residential developments shall be self-contained in terms of meeting the requirements of this Ordinance. In addition to other relevant requirements, site plans and subdivision plats shall designate and establish maintenance responsibility for all required recreation, resource protection, and other open space and common properties within the development site. Where a performance residential development is to be built in stages or will contain a mixture of land uses, a Master Development Plan shall be required.

Section 503 Building Setbacks. A. Minimum Setbacks. To calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure adequate light, air, and privacy to abutting properties, multiply the height of the proposed building by the Angle of Light Exposure Factor for the zoning district as shown below:  District Angle of Light Exposure Factor  DDH 1.0 NRD 0.75 MDRD 0.5 RDD 1.0 LLRD 1.0 R 1.0 LDD 1.0 CDD 1.0 SCCD 1.0 V-22    The product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the property line. If, based on this calculation, the setback required is greater than the minimum width of the required bufferyard, the setback according to the angle of light exposure factor must be used. Also, note that the setback required by this calculation may further restrict the setback requirements of Section 502.02 for performance housing types. In all cases the most restrictive setback requirement must be used. This section shall not apply to conventional subdivisions in any district. B. Exceptions. The following structures shall be allowed to project into or be constructed in any minimum required yard as follows: awnings and canopies, roof overhangs and balconies not to exceed three (3) feet; bay windows, not to exceed two (2) feet; clotheslines; driveways and their curbs, fences, walls, and hedges may be constructed in minimum yard areas, provided that their installation does not violate any other provision of this Ordinance. Uncovered decks of no more than 30 inches in height may extend to within five (5) feet of the property line. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to allow encroachment of any feature into a required bufferyard. C. Maximum Setbacks. Where lots have double frontage, the maximum setback shall apply to the frontage upon any designated corridor (Section 429). For corner properties, the maximum setback shall be measured from the property line of both rights-of-way. This setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements. Recessed portions of any proposed structure, designed for outdoor seating, dining or events shall be allowed under the requirements of this section following the review and approval of the Planning Commission. Such recesses shall be clearly illustrated on the site plan. D. Building Setback and Height Requirements for the Industrial District. Setbacks (ft) Building Height Zoning District Front Rear Total Side Minimum Side1 Side Yard On Street Maximum Height Feet I 10 25 30 151 10 75 1INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT: Where a four (4)-hour firewall is used, no side yard is required. Otherwise, the side wall of the principal structure shall be set back at least 15 feet from the side property line or 25 feet from any adjacent structure, whichever is greater, provided that the distance shall be increased by three (3) feet for each story of each structure in excess of two stories. E. Building Setback and Height for the Urban Core (UC), College Edge Overlay District (CEOD), and Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts. For building setbacks in the Urban Core (UC) district see Section 507. For building setbacks in the College Edge Overlay District (CEOD) see Section 508. For building setbacks in the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) districts see Section 509. Section 504. Planned Developments. A planned development is intended to encourage flexibility in siting, mixtures of housing types and land uses, open space, and the preservation of significant natural features. The goal is a development in which buildings, land use, transportation facilities, utility systems and open spaces are integrated through an overall design. A planned development shall be permitted in a Planned Development District (PDD) overlay district. The PDD overlay district is an additional zoning requirement that is placed on a geographic area already zoned. The PDD designation can be requested and considered only for properties already zoned as DDH, MDRD, CDD, LDD, NRD, RDD, CRD, and SCCD. V-23   Property receiving a PDD designation shall be subject to the provisions of both the base zoning district and the PDD. The base zone, which is the underlying zone, shall regulate the lot area, setback, bulk regulations, parking, the maximum FAR and ISR, maximum gross density and the minimum open space ratio for performance residential uses; and the minimum site area and lot width for nonresidential uses. The PDD overlay zone shall regulate the permitted and conditional uses allowed; the mixed-use development components; and the maximum percentage of allowable dwelling units in a mixed commercial/residential development. Where provisions of the PDD and the zoning districts are in conflict, the provisions of the PDD shall govern. 504.01. Minimum Size and Ownership. A planned development shall consist of a minimum of ten (10) acres. At the time of the application for PDD zoning, the entire tract of land for which rezoning is requested shall be under unified control of a single individual, partnership or corporation. 504.02. Uses Permitted on Approval. All conditional uses set forth on Table 4-1 for PDD are allowed if approved by City Council. Mixed-use developments are allowed within the Planned Development District (PDD) and according to the following requirements:  A. The maximum gross density, minimum open space ratio and maximum density factor for all planned developments shall be the same as the base district from which the site was rezoned. The allowable figures for the Limited Development District (LDD) shall serve as the minimum standard in all cases. B. A mixed-use development in the Planned Development District may consist of: 1) any commercial uses permitted in this district as set forth in Sections 402 and 408 of this Ordinance, and 2) one or more dwelling units on the same development as the commercial uses. A Master Development Plan shall be required in connection with any request for PDD zoning. 504.03. Connection between uses and adjoining development. Connection between mixed use and residential areas is required in order to provide cohesiveness in the overall development site. Cohesiveness shall be provided through connectedness of land uses, streets, utilities, pedestrian and bicycle paths, greenways, and signage. The design of any planned development or mixed-use development should reflect effort by the developer to plan land uses so as to blend harmoniously not only within the development site, but with adjacent land uses to ensure compatibility, cohesiveness, and connectivity. 504.04. Changes to zoning ordinance. No amendments to this zoning ordinance relative to planned development shall be effective to any PDD approval issued prior to such amendment, it being intended that the PDD shall continue to be developed in accordance with the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of such prior approval. (Amendments dated 5/02/06 pursuant to Ordinance Number 2389) 504.05. Development Incentives. Development incentives shall be provided to developers of qualified planned development upon the written request. Incentive is the granting by the approving authority of additional development capacity in exchange for a public benefit or amenity. Providing incentives is not just beneficial for the developer, but to adjacent development, and the public. The need for incentives will vary for different planned developments. Therefore, the allocation of incentives shall be determined on a case-by- case basis. Incentives may include any of the following:  Incentive Density Bonus: 10% increase in base zone density. Density Bonus: 20% increase in base zone density* V-24   Floor Area Ratio: An increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) for individual performance single-family residential lots not to exceed 20% above the allowable FAR. Reduced Setbacks: Reduction in front and side setback requirements for single-family residential uses as long as the minimum front yard setback is at least ten (10) feet and no porch encroaches into this 10-foot front setback. The side yards shall not be less than five feet. The request for setback incentives shall not result in encroachment of any structures into a required landscaped bufferyard, stream buffer or other environmentally sensitive areas. Reduction in Minimum Lot Width: A reduction up to 20% in the minimum lot width for single-family detached and zero lot line residential lots. No reduction shall be allowed for lots located in a cul-de-sac or along the curvature of a street. Master Signage Plan Approval: To expedite the sign permitting process, a Master Sign Plan can be submitted depicting all proposed signage, in accordance with Section 606, for the planned development. Flexibility may be granted by the Planning Director in the number, size, location, and height of the signs. Once approved, no signs shall be erected on the site, except as shown on the approved Master Signage Plan. A Master Development Plan may be amended by filing a new plan. Accelerated Preliminary Plat Approval Process: To expedite the approval process, preliminary plats for residential developments shall be approved administratively by staff. This incentive shall be contingent upon findings by the staff that the preliminary plats are consistent with the approved Master Development Plan. A public hearing for the preliminary plat will be held in conjunction with the public hearing for the PDD/Master Development Plan approval process. In this case, the Master Development Plan will be referred to as the Preliminary Master Development Plan. A Preliminary Master Development Plan shall be required to contain more detailed information relative to the lot size and lot width of each residential lot. Increase in ISR: An increase in the impervious surface ratio (ISR) for residential uses not to exceed 20% above the allowable ISR. This incentive is not applicable to developments in the Lake Ogletree/Martin-Marietta watersheds and any areas zoned for conservation subdivisions. *The exchange for this incentive is predetermined. See asterisk* under Exchange. Exchange Open Space Improvements: Improvements to greenway/open space such as pedestrian paths, bike trails, and street lighting along pedestrian paths and bike trails. Improvements must be approved by the Planning Director and the Parks and Recreation Director. *Housing for the Elderly and/or Low and Moderate Income: Provision of housing qualifying as elderly housing or low- and moderate-income families in accordance with federal guidelines (See Economic Development). Vegetated Buffer Along the Perimeter: A 20-foot wide undisturbed natural or landscaped buffer along the perimeter of the development site. An undisturbed natural buffer/open space is an unimproved area that has retained its natural character of trees, shrubs and ground covering. A landscaped buffer must meet the standards for residential buffer landscaping requirements as cited in Section 422.03 of this Ordinance. Increased Open Space: A 25% increase in open space beyond the minimum required open space for the development site (required acreage of open space X 25%). The additional open space shall be comprised of undisturbed natural open space. Vegetated buffers along the perimeter cannot count toward the increased open space requirement. In addition, stream buffers, utility easements and other easements required by the City of Auburn shall not count as open space under this incentive. Moreover, this exchange can be offered twice for two incentives. For example, a developer can offer a 50% increase over the minimum required open space for his development site in exchange for two incentives of his choice. V-25   Park and Recreation Areas: A minimum of five acres of useable park space to be developed and maintained primarily for both active and passive recreational pursuits, including but not limited to tot-lots, playgrounds, neighborhood parks, and play fields. These five acres can be dispersed throughout the development site, as long as the total acreage of park and recreational areas is equivalent to five acres. Improvements shall not be permitted in the increased open space cited above but shall be permitted on the land allocated to meet the minimum open space requirement under the base zone designation. Proposed improvements must be approved by the Planning Director and Parks and Recreation Director. This exchange cannot be offered in conjunction with the open space improvement unless approved by the Director of Parks and Recreation. The parks and recreation areas must be owned and maintained by the developer and/or a homeowners’ association. Parking in the Rear for Multi-Family: Parking for multi-family development shall be located in the rear of the buildings. Parking in the Rear for Commercial/Office Use: Parking for commercial and office developments shall be located in the rear of the buildings. Limited Access: Access to single-family attached and detached dwellings shall be provided from alleys and/or shared driveways. Low Density Along the Edge: Lower density residential development along the perimeter of the development site or adjacent to existing single-family residential development on adjoining properties. For the purpose of this exchange, lower density residential is defined as a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet. Dedicated Open Space: Land allocated and dedicated to the City for future parks and public greenways in accordance with the City’s greenway/future park plan. The land must be dedicated after the PDD rezoning is approved by the City Council and prior to the first preliminary plat submission. No request for an incentive shall be accepted unless an exchange is offered. An exchange is a public benefit or amenity provided by an applicant or developer for additional development capacity. The developer shall have the option of choosing from the list the exchange to offer for the incentive. A planned development shall be allowed only two development incentives. The entire area shown on a Master Development Plan shall constitute a planned development site for the purpose of allocating incentives and exchanges. Requests for incentives and the reasons therefore shall be set forth by the applicant in the application for PDD approval. The applicant shall explain in his request how each incentive would benefit, and not be detrimental, to the public interest. The benefits derived from the exchange may not necessarily impact the development itself. No incentives may be allowed when the proposed modification would result in:  (1) Traffic volume exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity of the planned development. (2) An undue burden on community facilities, such as schools, fire and police protection, utilities, and other such facilities. (3) Detrimental impact on surrounding land uses. (4) Incompatibility with the goals of the Land Use Plan. (5) Negative impact on the local watersheds. V-26   Staff will review each request for incentive as requested and address the above findings in the staff report. The burden of proof that these criteria are not being violated shall rest with the applicant and not the staff. Development incentives, if granted, shall supersede the applicable regulations of the base and PDD zoning districts of the planned development. All incentives requested and exchanges offered relative to density bonuses, minimum lot width, open space, perimeter buffer, parking and low density must be reflected on the proposed Master Development Plan as presented to the Planning Commission or City Council for approval. Incentives shall become a component of the Master Development Plan and shall be binding upon all future development on the site. Incentives shall be subject to requirements pursuant to Sections 504.03 and 504.04. Section 505. Master Development Plan. A Master Development Plan is a conceptual drawing that provides for the coordinated development of a specific area. A Master Development Plan shall be required if one or more of the following is proposed:  A. When any development site is to be developed in stages or phases, no plat or phase plan for any fraction of the site shall be accepted for review which has more than the maximum gross density or less than the minimum required open space pursuant to Table 4-2, unless a Master Development Plan is submitted (See Section 802.09)  B. When a request is made for Planned Development District (PDD) zoning. C. For any development containing a mixture of residential and non-residential land uses over five (5) acres in size or containing more than ten (10) dwelling units. D. For any rezoning request relative to the village concept and activity centers. E. For any development site comprising five acres or more in the Urban Neighborhood (UN), Medium Density Residential District (MDRD), Neighborhood Redevelopment District (NRD), and Corridor Redevelopment (CRD) districts. Master Development Plans required for developments described in Subsections (A), (C), and (E) above shall be submitted with the site plan, preliminary plat, or conditional use request. The Master Development Plan shall depict the entire project. Such plan shall be subject to review by the Planning Commission and shall not be referred to the City Council unless a conditional use approval is requested. A written report shall be required unless all or parts of the report are waived by the Planning Director (See Section 504.01). The applicant shall submit a master development plan map, drawn at a scale of either 50, 100, or 200 feet to one inch, or at a scale approved by the Planning Director and including the following information:  1. Title of the development, parcel number(s), name of the developer and registered land surveyor or engineer, date of the plan, a north arrow and scale. 2. A vicinity map showing the general location of the property, development and any incorporated city boundaries within 3 miles of the development. 3. Outer boundary lines or perimeter of the overall development site. 4. Proposed sizes of the various types of lots or parcels to be developed (acreage or square footage). 5. The type, number and approximate locations of all dwelling units. V-27   6. All streams, stream buffers, wetlands, and flood hazard zones. 7. All streets, including: existing major thoroughfares serving, traversing, abutting, or otherwise affecting or affected by the proposed plan area; proposed local, collector and arterial streets; points of ingress and egress; and existing easements and rights-of-way within the plan area. 8. If more than one zoning district is proposed, boundaries of the different zoning districts. 9. General location of utilities, easements, drainage facilities and other service facilities. 10. Overall gross density for the development site, as well as, density for each individual stage or phase. 11. Location and approximate acreage of all resource protection, recreation, greenways, open space lands, pedestrian circulation systems, bike trails, public facilities such as schools, and other common properties. 12. Required bufferyards. 13. Name or numbering of phases. 505.01. Written Report to Accompany the Master Development Plan. The master development plan map shall be accompanied by a written report, to be adopted as a part of the master development plan that includes the following information:  1. Methods of screening and buffering, where incompatible land use configurations necessitate protection for the proposed development or surrounding development. 2. Provisions for creation, use and maintenance of open space and recreation areas. 3. Significant natural topographical, natural features of the subject property and preservation of natural features of the land. 4. General provisions for pedestrian and bicycle circulation throughout the development. 5. A statement specifying how roads, waste disposal, water supply, fire protection, and utilities will be provided, with approximate timing and location, including closest sewer and community waterlines and capacity to serve this development. 6. A report or narrative assessing adequacy of water supply to serve the proposed development. 7. A statement specifying how amenities are to be provided (sidewalks, greenways, open space, parks, recreational facilities, streetlights, landscaping) including approximate timing and location. 8. A statement of the projected population and anticipated impact of the development upon existing utilities and community facilities and services including, but not limited to, water, electricity, sewer and solid waste disposal, schools and parks, police and fire protection. 9. Projected trip generation for the entire project at completion. If projected trip generation is of sufficient magnitude to significantly increase traffic, thereby reducing the level of service on one or more abutting or surrounding streets, or where existing demonstrable traffic problems have already been identified such as high number of accidents, substandard road design or surface; or the road is near, at, or over capacity, a traffic impact V-28   study is necessary. Refer to Section 435 of the City of Auburn Zoning Ordinance for the contents of the transportation impact report. 10. A statement on the type of commercial development proposed, including total square footage, setback, building coverage and height, impervious surfaces and off-street parking. 11. A development schedule including projected build-out date (see Section 504.02). 12. A valid legal description of the property of the total proposed site. 13. Design standards, if required. 14. Any other information the Planning Director or Planning Commission determines to be relevant to evaluate the character and impact of the proposed planned development. Certain informational requirements contained in this subsection may be waived upon a determination by the Planning Director that they are not applicable or necessary to the proposed application. Upon approval, the written report shall become a component of the Master Development Plan and shall be binding upon all future development on the site. 505.02. Phasing and Staging the Master Development Plan. Nothing within this Section precludes an applicant from delineating the development site into geographic areas called phases. Each phase of a development shall be able to exist as an independent stable unit. The phases shall be indicated by a numeric system or subdivision names. The phasing of a development site shall in no way indicate the stages of development. Staging is the timing and geographical sequence of development. The applicant may elect to develop the site in successive stages in a manner consistent with the Master Development Plan. The Planning Commission may require that the development be done in stages if public utilities are not adequate to service the entire development initially. The staging of a planned development shall consist of a development schedule indicating the approximate date when construction of the various phases can be expected to begin and be completed. This schedule shall show a steady progression toward completion of the project. If the planned development is expected to be constructed in stages or according to phases during a period extending beyond a single construction season (18 months), a development schedule shall be submitted with the Master Development Plan indicating:  (A) The approximate date when construction of the project can be expected to begin; (B) The order and timing in which the phases of the project will be built and the estimated time of completion of each phase; (C) The land area, density, the approximate location of common open space and facilities, and public improvements that will be required at each stage. (D) The Planning Commission may require a planting schedule for landscaping and bufferyards, which assures that these amenities are provided at substantially the same rate as residential dwelling units. The development schedule is a required component of the Master Development Plan that is not binding upon the applicant but shall be used for informational purposes. The Planning Commission may waive a development schedule upon submission of written justification by the applicant. V-29   505.03. Process for PDD and Master Development Plan Approval. Pre-Application Conference. The applicant and/or his or her representatives are required to confer with the City’s development staff prior to the submission of a PDD application, a mixed-use development plan or a development plan involving stages of development. Representatives from the Planning Department, Water Resource Management, and Engineering Services Departments shall attend. The purpose of the conference is to exchange information and receive guidance concerning the process for approval and the provision of the PDD zone. Submission of the Application. An application for approval for a development site requiring a Master Development Plan shall include: the application, the Master Development Plan (Section 504), the written report (Section 504.01), staging of development schedule (Section 504.02) and required fees. Planning Division Review and Recommendation: After the receipt of the application and all pertinent attachments, the Planning Department shall prepare a staff report to the planning commission containing their findings:  A. As to the suitability of the site for the planned development zoning proposed and the relation of the proposed development to the surrounding areas as it relates to existing and probable future development;  B. As to the suitability of proposed streets to adequately carry anticipated traffic, and whether increased densities will generate traffic in such an amount as to overload the street network outside the development site. C. As to access to utilities and proposed utility services that will be adequate for the population densities proposed. D. As to proper justification for the development proposed, including commercial, and its consistency with the Land Use Plan and adopted development policy of the City of Auburn. E. As to the impact the proposed development would have on local natural resources in the general area. F. As to whether the applicant submitted the application and all relevant materials and adequately addressed all the information required in the written report. The applicant’s written report shall be submitted as part of the Planning Department’s staff report. G. As to the proposed development compliance with this Ordinance, the Land Use Plan and other plans, maps, and ordinance adopted by the City to guide its growth and development. Based upon such findings, the Planning Department shall recommend to the planning commission approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of the Master Development Plan and the rezoning, if the application is a request for a PDD. Action by the Planning Commission. Following the receipt of the Planning Department staff report, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing and review staff’s report along with the Master Development Plan. The Planning Commission shall recommend to the city council either approval of the Master Development Plan as proposed, approval subject to conditions and modifications, or denial with reasons therefor. City Council Review and Approval. After receipt of the recommendation from the Planning Commission, the City Council shall hold a public hearing and render a decision on any Master Development Plan and any request for rezoning, if the application is a request for a PDD. The City Council shall approve, approve with V-30   conditions set forth by the Planning Commission, approve with conditions or modifications imposed by City Council, or deny the Master Development Plan. 505.04. Reapplication if Denied. If a request for Master Development Plan approval is denied, the matter cannot be reopened or be the subject of a new request for at least one year unless the conditions have changed significantly from the first time it was heard. A request for re-hearing less than one year from the date of the initial hearing must include evidence that the conditions pertinent to the case have changed significantly. If after reviewing the request, the Planning Commission is convinced that there has been significant change, then a new application shall be filed. 505.05. Conditional Use Approval and the Plan. Approval of the Master Development Plan shall constitute conditional use approval for performance residential uses as set forth in the Master Development Plan and in accordance with the PDD zoning district on Table 4-1. Nonresidential uses in a planned or mixed-use development are subject to a separate conditional use approval process by the Planning Commission and City Council prior to an application for a zoning certificate. 505.06. Density and Open Space Standards for Individual Stages. A Master Development Plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission prior to or simultaneously with any regular site plan or subdivision plat submitted. Upon approval of the Master Development Plan, the developer may submit and the Planning Commission may approve subdivision plats or site plans for individual phases or stages. Where any development site is to be developed in stages, no plat or phase plan for any fraction of the site shall be accepted for review which has more than the maximum gross density or less than the minimum required open space as shown in this section. No individual stage shall exceed the following density or fail to meet the minimum open space percentage:   Zoning District Maximum Density* (Units/Acre) Minimum Open Space (Percent) CDD 14 15 LDD 7.5 20 DDH 8 15 MDRD 16 10 NRD 12 15 RDD 24 10 CRD-U 20 10 CRD-S 14 15 CRD-W 14 10 CRD-E 16 10   *Refer to Tables 4-1, 5-1, 5-2 and Section 502.02 for   density requirements for other zoning districts not listed When submitting a plat for individual stages or phases of development, the applicant must submit a boundary survey for that stage of the development. 505.07. Changes or Modification to the Plan. Once approved, the Master Development Plan shall become a binding condition of development on the site, and subsequent stages or phases of the development shall be V-31   substantially consistent with it. Approval of such plan shall bind the applicant, owner and mortgagee or any subsequent ownership interest, if any, with respect to the contents of such plan. If the Planning Director finds that any stage or phase plan substantially deviates from the approved Master Development Plan, a new master plan shall be required for Planning Commission review prior to approval of further site plans or subdivision plats within the development. Any of the following changes shall constitute a “substantial deviation:”  A. An increase or reduction in land area of the development. B. An increase in the total number of dwelling units. C. Provision of less than the required percentage of recreation, resource protection, or open space land. D. Proposal of single family attached, duplex, multi-family or zero lot-line development in place of approved single family detached housing. E. Any significant addition, removal or rearrangement of land uses or streets. 505.08. Termination of Approved Plan. Implementation of the Master Development Plan must commence within the 24 months following approval. Commencement of a Plan shall mean the recording of a final plat covering at least a portion of the development site. Recognizing that conditions may change during extended periods of time to such an extent that approved plans for a planned development may not be in the public interest, failure to actively pursue an authorized planned development shall automatically reverse the rezoning and the property shall revert to its prior zoning designation, and the Master Development Plan will no longer be valid. In cases where the PDD approval was accompanied by a base zone rezoning (i.e., from Rural to any eligible PDD base zone, for example), the base zone shall also revert to its prior zoning designation. Section 506. Mixed-Used Developments. 506.01. Purpose. Developments, other than those within a Planned Development District (PDD), which include more than one use on the same site, and in which the uses fall into two or more different use categories, shall be treated as mixed-use developments; and are required to meet the standards of this Section in addition to any other regulations imposed by this Ordinance. 506.02. Treatment of Mixed Developments. All uses proposed within a mixed-use development must be permitted under Table 4-1 in the district in which the development is to be located. Uses shown in Table 4- 1 as conditional must be approved under the provisions of Section 803. For review purposes, a separate development site for each land use category shall be delineated within a mixed-use development wherever possible. For shopping centers and any other case in which the different land uses occupy a single structure, the most restrictive requirements relating to any of the individual uses will be applied to the entire site. 506.03. Residential Uses in the Urban Core District. Residential uses are allowed in the Urban Core District only in accordance with the restrictions listed below. A. A mixed-use facility in the Urban Core District may consist of:  1. Any commercial, retail, office, or institutional use permitted in this District as set forth in Table 4-1 of this Ordinance; and  2. One dwelling unit within the same structure as the commercial use in the case of a townhouse development; or. V-32   3. Three or more dwelling units within the same structure as the commercial use in the case of multiple unit development. B. Each living unit shall have a minimum floor area of 400 square feet. C. As many dwelling units may be constructed in a mixed commercial/residential facility as would be permitted if the floor area ratio for the Urban Core District (Table 4-3) were applied to the entire mixed commercial/residential facility. D. No off-street parking will be required for nonresidential uses in the Urban Core District (Section 513.02). E. Prior to construction of new structures or expansion of existing structures, a site plan shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to Article VIII. 506.04. Mixed Uses in the Urban Neighborhood District (UN-E, UN-W and UN-S). Mixed uses are allowed in the Urban Neighborhood District only in accordance with the restrictions listed below. A. A mixed-use facility in the Urban Neighborhood District may consist of:  1. Any commercial, retail, office, or institutional use permitted in this District as set forth in Table 4-1 of this Ordinance; and  2. One dwelling unit within the same structure as the commercial use in the case of a townhouse development; or. 3. Three or more dwelling units within the same structure as the commercial use in the case of multiple unit development. B. Each living unit shall have a minimum floor area of 400 square feet. C. As many dwelling units may be constructed in a mixed commercial/residential facility as would be permitted if the floor area ratio for the Urban Neighborhood District (Section 509) were applied to the entire mixed commercial/residential facility. D. Off-street parking will be required for residential and nonresidential uses in the Urban Neighborhood District (Section 513.01 and 513.02). E. Prior to construction of new structures or expansion of existing structures, a site plan shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to Article VIII. Section 507. Urban Core (UC) District. 507.01. Conflict with other Sections. Where this is conflict between these Urban Core (UC) District provisions and other sections of the Zoning Ordinance, regulations for the Urban Core (UC) District shall govern. V-33   507.02. Urban Core (UC) District Development and Design Standards. Table 5-3 prescribes development and design standards applicable to the Urban Core (UC) District. Table 5-3 Development and design standard requirements within the Urban Core (UC) District Setback All structures shall be set back no further than 10 feet from any designated corridor (see Section 429) or primary street frontage. Structure Height Structure height shall not exceed 75 feet measured from grade to the top of the roof structure.

Mixed Use Provisions Buildings 100 feet or greater must contain an active use at the ground story for no less than 70% of the length of any street frontage. No more than 50% of ground story street frontage shall be used as private amenity space for exclusive use by residents of the building. The Planning Director may reduce the V-35   minimum frontage of active use space required to accommodate for unique circumstances. Such reductions shall not exceed ten (10) feet. Corner lots shall locate any nonresidential uses at the intersection of the highest street classification. Garage entrances, mechanical rooms, blank walls, and areas inaccessible to the general public are prohibited on building corners. Garages, blank walls, service entries, or mechanical rooms shall not exceed 30% of the ground story street frontage. In addition to the requirements for conditional use approval in Section 803, applications for conditional use approval within the UC shall submit building elevations and covenants for the proposed development. Residential Use Provisions Ground story residential units shall be designed as independent living units with a primary entrance that takes access from the public right of way or nearest sidewalk. No more than four individual units may share said entryway. Units on the 3rd story and above shall take separate access interior to the building. Minimum unit width: 18 feet Maximum unit width: 50 feet Minimum front setback: 5 feet Minimum fenestration: 30% No more than 30% of ground story street frontage shall be used for residential uses in the UC zoning district, north of East Thach Avenue. * Ground story residential uses are prohibited on the following streets: 1.

For non-residential uses see Table 4-3 Impervious Surface Ratio (ISR) 0.75 for Mixed Use, Multiple Unit Development and Private Dormitory use. See Section 502.02 for all other performance residential use standards. For non-residential uses see Table 4-3 Building Mass The maximum street-facing building length is 240 feet. Buildings on corner lots shall locate at the corner of the highest street classification. Connections made from one building mass to another beyond the maximum building length are limited to hallways, breezeways, and overhead walkways not to exceed 25 feet in combined width per story. The minimum separation between buildings where connections are provided is 15 feet. Such connections shall be setback no less than 30 feet from the property line. Enclosed connections shall be permitted only at the second story and above and shall be fenestrated at 80% to provide transparency through the connecting structure. V-49   Articulation in Structure Height: For buildings 100 feet or more in length, the street-facing roof line must have a variation in height. On a corner lot, the variation in height must be located at the corner of the building that addresses both street fronts. Parapets and other prominent architectural details visible from the street which rise above the roofline may account for the required articulation in structure height. Articulation in Building Façade: Buildings 100 feet or more in length must use changes in the depth of plane to create variations in the building face along the street frontage. Forecourts: A portion of the building, not to exceed thirty percent (30%) of the street frontage but not less than ten (10) feet in width, may be used as a recessed area along the front plane for additional entrances and amenity space. Vehicular access shall be prohibited in this space. A maximum of one forecourt is permitted per structure. Façade Composition The maximum length of individual façade compositions along a required building line, generally running parallel to the street frontage, shall be 100 feet. Each façade composition shall be distinct by means of material changes, fenestration, and/or configuration of architectural elements. Fenestration The percentage of openings for glass fenestration of nonresidential uses at street level (ground story) visible from the street is required to be a minimum of 30% of the total façade area measured from floor to floor. The percentage of openings for glass fenestration at the second story visible from the street is required to be a minimum of 20% of the total façade area measured from floor to floor. The percentage of openings for glass fenestration at the third story and above visible from the street is required to be a minimum of 20% of the total façade area measured from floor to floor. The maximum bulkhead height of the ground story is four (4) feet above the grade level. Spandrel areas shall be no larger than six (6) feet in height for all ground story fenestration. Colored or mirrored glass is not permitted. Cladding Materials Building materials shall consist of stone, masonry, ceramic tile, terracotta tile, wood (not composite), precast concrete and traditional “hard coat” stucco or brick with accents of stucco, limestone, or wood.

Concealed Equipment and Prohibited Products  The following shall be located or screened so as not to be visible from any public street: air conditioning compressors, window and wall air conditioners, dumpsters, electrical and other utility meters, irrigation and pool pumps, permanent barbeques, satellite antennae, utility appurtenances, mechanical rooftop equipment or ventilation apparatus. Mixed Use Provisions Buildings 100 feet or greater must contain an active use at the ground story for no less than 70% of the length of any street frontage. The Planning Director may reduce the minimum frontage of active use space required to V-50   accommodate for unique circumstances. Such reductions shall not exceed ten (10) feet. Corner lots shall locate any nonresidential uses at the intersection of the highest street classification. Garage entrances, mechanical rooms, blank walls, and areas inaccessible to the general public are prohibited on building corners. Garages, blank walls, service entries, or mechanical rooms shall not exceed 30% of the ground story street frontage. Residential Use Provisions Ground story residential units shall be designed as independent living units with a primary entrance that takes access from the public right of way or nearest sidewalk. No more than four individual units may share said entryway. Units on the 3rd story and above shall take separate access interior to the building. Minimum unit width: 18 feet Maximum unit width: 50 feet Minimum front setback: 5 feet Minimum fenestration: 30% (See Section 502.02(A.) for fee-simple Single-family detached) Open Space Requirements* 0.15 open space shall be required for Performance Residential Developments on parcels greater than one (1) acre. On parcels less than one (1) acre, no separate platted open space lots shall be required, however the required 0.15 open space shall be calculated and subtracted from the parcel. The remainder of this calculation will be the basis for determining the total of units allowed. The open space calculation shall be divided equally among and attached to each lot. This minimum open space shall be designated on the subdivision plat and shall not be used for the placement of any structures, parking, or bufferyard. Example: For a single-family performance residential, the minimum lot size is 5,000 s.f. 22,000 s.f. x 0.15 = 3300  22,000 – 3300 = 18,700  18,700 ÷ 5,000 = 3.74 lots. The maximum number of lots allowed would be 3. The minimum amount of open to be added to each lot would be 1,100 s.f. Parking Requirement See Section 513 for parking requirement. A maximum of 20 percent of required parking spaces may be provided off-site at a public parking facility through a lease arrangement with the City of Auburn. Development approval is subject to availability of the needed number of spaces at a City-owned parking facility. Parking Lot Screening Grade level parking (surface or structured) must be located behind the front building facades. Grade level structured parking located at the perimeter of a structure must be screened so that cars are not visible from adjacent streets. Screening must use approved cladding material or vegetation to hide parked vehicles and shield lighting. Sloped ramps must not be discernable along the perimeter of the parking structure. In cases where the parking cannot be screened by a structure of the permitted use as determined by the Planning Director, parking adjacent to any street ROW must be separated with a planted buffer at least five (5) feet wide. V-51   The planting requirement shall be 1 canopy tree and 6 shrubs for every twenty- five (25) feet of ROW frontage. The planting requirements and buffer width may vary due to site conditions at the discretion of the Planning Director. Surface parking adjacent to any street ROW shall also be screened with a Type 1, Option A fence (see Figure 4-2) with support piers that are clad with stone, brick, stucco or architecturally decorative concrete block.

Parking Lot Screening Parking for non-residential and mixed-use developments must be located behind the front building facades. Parking adjacent to any street ROW shall be screened with a Type 1, Option A fence (see Figure 4-2) with support piers that are clad with stone, brick, stucco or architecturally decorative concrete block and landscaped with 1 canopy tree and 6 shrubs for every twenty-five (25) feet of ROW frontage between the fence and street. The planting requirements and buffer width may vary due to site conditions at the discretion of the Planning Director. It is also the desire of the Renew Opelika Road Corridor Plan and the Northwest Auburn Neighborhood Plan that residential use parking be V-54   located behind building facades. To achieve this, an increase in the impervious surface ratio (ISR), not to exceed 20% will be allowed. Landscaping Sites must meet the general landscaping requirements in Section 422 unless specifically excluded in this section. Bufferyards: Street-trees – Where a street tree master plan has been implemented for a particular street which the development site fronts; the plantings from the street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for that particular frontage. If the Planning Director determines that the requirements of the street tree master plan cannot be met, the general landscaping requirements of Section 422 must be met. Side and rear bufferyards may be reduced or waived by the Planning Director if the adjoining uses are similar in nature or if the buildings are built in a continuous urban form that would be interrupted by a greenspace. Decks, porches, balconies and pedestrian areas, including plazas, street arcades, courtyards, and outdoor cafes may extend into bufferyards. In no case shall the encroachment exceed 60 percent of the length of the property line of the particular bufferyard. Building Facade The development shall have primary entrances that face and open directly on to publicly accessible streets or public open spaces. Buildings may use an alternative entrance provided that there is outdoor dining or integrated display area between the building and public street. If the building is located on a corner lot, the building may face the corner. Development Sites with multiple buildings must only have the façade of the principal building facing the primary street. Additional buildings may face internal drives or secondary streets. Cladding Materials Sites must meet requirements of Section 429 Corridor Overlay Standards.

Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square feet can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade that has a sidewalk or entrance. A blade mounted sign is defined as an ornamental rod extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging sign suspended from it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street ROW. Blade signs are to be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above sidewalk level to the bottom of the blade sign. Text and graphics on either or both ends of an awning that are oriented perpendicular to the building face for pedestrian view and are no more than six (6) square feet may be provided in lieu of a blade sign. All building signs must be mounted between the first and second floor line, or between the second and third floor line or near the top of the wall. The Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate location for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause damage to architectural ornamentation of a building. In any case, building signs may not be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the primary sign is computed by measuring the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle, within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed. A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being advertised, and is generally two (2) sided. Sandwich board signs that meet all of the following criteria may be placed and displayed on a public sidewalk: a. A height of no more than four (4) feet; b. Maximum area of any side is eight (8) square feet; c. No illumination; d. Placed in front of the building or leased space during business hours respective to the use in the building or leased space; e. Maintains a clearance on the sidewalk of at least five (5) feet; and, f. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other sandwich board sign. Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side make it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich board spacing requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate designee, V-56   may approve an alternative location that maximizes distance between adjacent signs. Awnings and Canopies Sloped or flat awnings and canopies are allowed. Awnings fabricated of canvas or metal are allowed. Awnings may be placed above and extend the width of any door or window, or extend up to 75% of the width of the building façade along the street line, whichever is greater; and must be supported from the building façade with suspension rods. Support structures for awnings or canopies cannot extend from the sidewalk. Awnings slopes may be flat to 45 degrees maximum and may not exceed 5 feet in vertical height. Section 511.

For Class II bicycle facilities, there shall be some form of stable frame permanently anchored to a foundation to which a bicycle frame and both wheels may be conveniently V-76   secured using a chain and padlock or locker. An aisle five feet (5’) in width shall be provided in the front or rear of a bicycle parking space to provide for entering and leaving the parking area. G. “Inverted U” type bike rack is recommended although other racks may be used provided they meet certain performance requirements. Racks must be easily usable with both U- locks and cable locks. Racks should support the bikes in a stable upright position so that a bike, if bumped, will not fall or roll down. In cases where wave or loop type racks are used, each hump or loop shall count as one (1) bicycle space provided the parking area meets dimension standards in Item E of this Section. H. When providing Class I bicycle parking spaces in a room or common locker, all required bicycle spaces shall be located inside that structure or shall be located in other areas protected from the weather. Bicycle parking spaces in parking structures shall be clearly marked as such and shall be separated from auto parking by some form of barrier to minimize the possibility of a parked bicycle being hit by a car. If a room not divided by individual spaces is used to meet the requirements, twelve (12) square feet of floor area shall be considered equivalent to one (1) bicycle parking space. Where manufactured metal lockers or racks are provided, each locker or stall devoted to bicycle parking shall be counted as one (1) bicycle parking space. I. Bicycle parking shall be located in close proximity to the building’s entrance and clustered in lots. Racks must not be placed close enough to a wall or other obstruction so as to make use difficult. J. Signs shall be posted stating where bicycle parking spaces are located for each development site where bicycle parking spaces are required. The signs shall be located in a prominent place such as entrances to the building or structure. The sign shall have a white background, with black lettering. K. Paving of bicycle parking areas is required. Section 515. Lighting. Light or glare from any operation and all lighting for parking areas or for the external illumination of buildings or grounds shall be directed or located in such a manner that direct or indirect illumination from the source of light shall not exceed one (1) foot candle when measured from any property line adjoining a residential development or five (5) foot candles for any property adjoining a non-residential development. All lighting fixtures incorporated into non-enclosed structures (i.e. gas pump canopies, car washes, etc.) must be fully recessed into the underside of such structures. All lighting must be directed and/or shielded so as to focus lighting onto the use as established and away from adjacent property and areas of pedestrian and vehicular traffic including, but not limited to, sidewalks and streets.

Airport height notification zone and regulations. A. Establishment of zone. The airport height notification zone is hereby established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map. This zone is established to regulate the height of structures and natural vegetation for areas in proximity to the public use airports located within the City of Auburn. The airport height notification zone, consists of two subzones, is defined as:  Subzone A. The area surrounding each public use airport extending outward twenty thousand (20,000) feet from the ends and each side of all active runways. Subzone B. The area outside of Subzone A. B. Airport height definition. For the purposes of determining building height in the height notification zone, height shall be measured in feet above ground level, rounded to the highest foot. The total structure height shall include anything mounted on top of the structure, such as antennas, obstruction lights, lightning rods, etc. C. Height notification regulations. All applicants of development proposals for land within the height notification zone determined to be a potential airport obstruction shall forward a notice of proposed construction (form 7460) to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be reviewed for conformance with the obstructions standards detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77 Subpart C. (14 CFR Part 77), as may be amended from time to time. 1. A proposed development shall be determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" if the proposed development would result in a structure or natural vegetation having a height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the ends and sides of a public use airport active runway at a slope of one (1) foot vertical to one hundred (100) feet horizontal outward to twenty thousand (20,000) feet for Subzone A or two hundred (200) feet above ground level for Subzone B. Applicants of any development proposal determined by the City to result in a structure(s) that constitutes a "potential airport obstruction" shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction during the development proposal review process by the Planning Director or his designee. No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure which is determined by the City to be a "potential airport obstruction" unless a city airport construction permit is granted. 2. Any proposed development which is not determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" is exempt from any airport height notification zone permitting regulations contained herein. 3. Airport construction permit procedures and criteria for approval. Any applicant affected by a notice of potential obstruction may apply to the Planning Director for an airport construction permit. a. Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit. i. Applicants shall submit to the planning division a completed airport construction permit application form (as provided by the City) and a copy of the notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA for the project. Permit requests may be considered V-81   by the Planning Director concurrent with development plan approval consideration. ii. Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, applicants shall submit to the planning division the final determination issued by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's notice of proposed construction submitted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77.  b. Criteria for granting an airport construction permit. i. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would not exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the Planning Director shall grant a airport construction permit for the proposed development provided that a condition is attached to the permit approval to ensure that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (C.O.) if so required by Chapter 14-60, in accordance with the standards of Rules of the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, as amended. ii. Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined that the proposed development exceeds the obstruction standards of 14 CFR Part 77, no airport construction permit may be approved, and a City airport obstruction variance (see Section 907.04) must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed development to proceed. A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of these regulations or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 516.07. Airport runway protection zone and regulations. A. Zone establishment. There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map a runway protection zone for areas at each end of every active runway as may be amended from time to time. Within a runway protection zone, certain uses are restricted or prohibited to reduce incompatibilities with normal airport operations and danger to public health. B.  Runway protection zone regulations. 1. Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited within the runway protection zone:  a. Educational centers (including all types of primary and secondary schools, pre-schools, child care facilities). b.
