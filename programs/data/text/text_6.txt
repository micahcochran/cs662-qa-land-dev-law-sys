(2) The stub street requirement may be waived by the Planning and Development Di- rector, provided such waiver has received the approval of the Gwinnett County De- partments of Public Safety and Public Utilities. (b) Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modi- fied by the Director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modi- fication may be conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be condi- tioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the re- moval of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection. (c) Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the de- veloper shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of- way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a Final Plat. (d) Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds 1000 feet in length, a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the prop- erty boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2,000 feet in length unless approved by the Planning and Devel- opment Department due to unusual topographic conditions or property configuration. 906.05 Service Roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access high- way right-of-way or major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of- way. 906.06 Half-Streets. Half-streets (new boundary streets having one-half of the minimum required right-of-way or pavement width) shall not be allowed nor access to same be permitted should it exist. Section 907 Traffic Control Devices. City of Duluth UDC 9-12 906.07 Reserve Strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the City under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the City At- torney or acceptable to the Director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. 906.08 Alleys. An alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street pursuant to the standards con- tained in this Article. 906.09 Street Jogs. (a) Street jogs shall either directly align or have off-sets of a minimum of 125 feet for resi- dential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for non-residential subdivision streets, as measured between centerlines of said streets, unless approved by the Planning and Development Department due to unusual topographic conditions or property configu- ration. (b) All major thoroughfares shall provide off-sets as required by the Planning and Develop- ment Department, where alignment is not desirable or feasible, but in no case be space less than 600 feet apart as measured between centerlines of said streets. Section 907. Traffic Control Devices. 907.01 Traffic Control Signs. Street signs, traffic control signs, and devices such as striping and signalization, shall be provid- ed by the developer.

Street name signs shall have a green background with white legends mounted on channelized posts. Alternate post material shall be subject to the review and approval of the Gwinnett County Traffic Engineer. The posts and signs will be furnished and installed by the devel- oper at all street intersections. The developer (or homeowner’s association in the event an al- ternate signpost is chosen at a later date) shall pay the County’s and/or City’s costs. 907.03 Traffic Signals and Signs. All traffic signals and signs shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (no decorative traffic control devices will be allowed). 907.04 Striping Requirements. All newly constructed streets having four or more lanes (including auxiliary lanes) and existing streets being widened with one or more additional lanes shall be striped or the payment of said striping costs shall be required from the Developer by the Planning and Development De- partment prior to the approval of the Development Conformance Certificate for the project. Striping shall be accomplished with paint meeting Georgia DOT standards conforming to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The developer shall apply the final striping after application of the final topping after receiving approval of the Department. City of Duluth UDC Section 907 Traffic Control Devices. 9-13 907.05 Payment of Fees. The developer shall pay Gwinnett County Traffic Engineering for the installation and fabrica- tion of traffic control devices and street name signs prior to approval of the final plat. 907.06 Street Lights. Street lights shall be provided by the developer in new subdivisions which propose the con- struction of a new street to be dedicated to the City or which propose lot access to existing City streets. All fees, materials, labor, poles, fixtures and any other associated items shall be furnished, paid for and installed by the developer. Street lighting shall be installed and operat- ing prior to approval of the final plat. (a) This Section shall apply for all developments or phases of development which have not re- ceived a development permit as of the date of adoption of this ordinance. (b) In all cases, guidelines related to materials, distances between poles, height, and any other relevant specifications shall be adhered to as set forth in The American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting and the power provider for the project.

Prior to approval of the Final Plat, all fees associated with materials, labor, and installation shall be paid to the appropriate power provider for the project and proof of payment shall be provided to the City. (d) Street lights shall be provided by the owner/developer in any new development where the streets are proposed to be dedicated to the City or which propose lot access to exist- ing City streets. (1) Location and spacing shall be coordinated with the electric company with jurisdic- tion over the property and shall be installed at the time the streets are constructed. (2) The City shall take over payment of the monthly energy charges from the own- er/developer once the development is 95% complete based on issued Certificates of Occupancy and after a written request is received from the developer/builder to take over monthly costs. (3) In a residential development, street lights shall be installed prior to approval of the Final Plat. Electrification of the lights shall occur once the development or phase has achieved 50% completion via issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) (4) In a non-residential development, street lights are to be installed prior to issuance of a C.O. for the building(s). (e) All fixtures and poles shall meet the requirements of the City and all maintenance shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or homeowner’s association. Fixtures shall be mounted a minimum of 16 feet above the ground and each fixture shall have appro- priate arm length to illuminate the street.

Sidewalks. 908.01 Where Required. (a) Sidewalks shall be required along all minor collector streets and major thoroughfares with- in a 1-mile radius of all existing and proposed public school sites, except within (internal to) non-residential subdivisions. Any development located along such route or within the 1- mile radius shall provide sidewalks along its frontage in accordance with this Section. (b) Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of any new street, any road classified as a Minor Collector or Major Thoroughfare, where the Duluth Sidewalk Master Plan identifies that sidewalks are planned for construction or on streets that the City Council has allotted funds for the installation of sidewalks. (1) If sidewalks are established along portions of the roadway or on the same side of the street as the new development, the owner/developer must install sidewalks in ac- cordance with Section 914.01 on any new development(s) site in order to connect with existing sidewalks. (2) The owner/developer may deposit funds into an account held by the City of Duluth designated for sidewalk construction at the discretion of the Director, if sidewalks are under construction or planned for construction to begin within one year. Said funds shall be in the amount of 110% of the cost for construction of the sidewalk on the property proposed for development as calculated by the Department. (c) Sidewalks may also be required as a condition of zoning, special use approval or by this De- velopment Code. Said sidewalks shall meet the location and construction requirements contained herein, unless otherwise specified in the conditions of approval. (d) Sidewalks provided voluntarily by a builder or developer shall meet the location and con- struction standards contained herein. Decorative sidewalks may be permitted at the dis- cretion of the Planning and Development Director, however location and size requirements shall be followed as contained herein. 908.02 Location Requirements. (a) Sidewalks shall be located 24 inches from the back of curb except in Conservation Subdivi- sions, Planned Unit Developments, or subdivisions in which street trees are provided (bridges excepted). Where no curbing exists or future road improvements are anticipated, the sidewalks shall be placed in a location acceptable to the Department. All new side- walks shall match and provide smooth transition to any existing sidewalks. (b) Sidewalks in Conservation Subdivisions, Planned Unit Developments or in subdivisions in which street trees are provided shall be located at least 6 feet from the back of curb (bridges excepted). The area between the curb and the sidewalk shall consist of grassing or landscaping. Where no curb exists, or if road improvements are proposed for installa- tion by the City, County or State, sidewalks, including appropriate drainage facilities, shall be constructed in a location acceptable to the Department of Planning and Development and/or Georgia Department of Transportation. (1) Sidewalks shall be required adjacent to the perimeter of eyebrow turnarounds. (2) Sidewalks shall be required adjacent to perimeter of cul-de-sac turnarounds. City of Duluth UDC Section 909 Performance Guidelines. 9-15 (3) Where possible, sidewalks shall be woven through existing vegetation, trees, etc. to create a “meandering sidewalk.” Section 909. Performance Guidelines. 909.01 General. (a) Purpose. The sub-sections enumerated in this Section 909 are guidelines, and are intended to be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They are further intended to allow alternate designs which could produce results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the absence of an acceptable alternative. (b) Constraints. The alternative design solutions are constrained by the requirements of this Article and the grading, detention, and drainage Requirements of Article 10, as well as the purpose and in- tent of this Development Code. (c) Documentation Required. In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the State of Georgia will be required to be submit- ted to and approved by the Department. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the Department, it shall become a required standard applicable to the specifically approved Permit. 909.02 Lots. (a) Lots should be designed generally such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line, unless exempted by the Planning and Develop- ment Director. (1) The Department requires notation that a House Location Plan (HLP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on all residential lots. (2) The Department may require notation that a Residential Drainage Plan (RDP) is re- quired to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where ad- ditional (site specific) engineering will be necessary to properly grade the lot or locate the building or other improvements. Such lots include, but are not limited to: A lot containing floodplain where fill or other encroachment into the floodplain is planned or reasonably expected; A lot containing severe topographic features interdicting the building site; A lot containing a drainage easement with a pipe discharge or other facilities, or flow characteristics which may adversely affect the location of a building or oth- er site improvements. (3) The Planning and Development Department may require notation that a Residential Drainage Study (RDS) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit  Section 909 Performance Guidelines. City of Duluth UDC 9-16 on certain lots where particular attention to site grading will be necessary, but formal engineering is not needed. Such an RDS is conducted in the field where the effect of the site grading must be accomplished with adequate care so as not to create a drain- age problem on neighboring properties. (b) Side lot lines generally should be at right angles (90 degrees) to straight street lines or ra- dial to curved street lines as much as practical. Side lot lines should be radial to the radius points of all cul-de-sacs. Variations of more than 10 degrees shall require approval of the Department, but shall be approved when appropriate to the reasonable loading pattern of the subdivision, efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions, or provisions of improved building sites over those which would result without such variation. (c) Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger so that they have the same width between minimum side setback lines as an interior lot, but in no case shall more than 75 feet between side setback lines on a corner lot be required. 909.03 Blocks. (a) The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to: (1) Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated, (2) Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions, (3) Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic, and (4) Limitations and opportunities of topography. (b) In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the Planning and Development Director may, when existing or proposed pedestrian circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian ways or pedestrian access easements, as appropriate, through the block. 909.04 Access. A maximum number of 200 residential dwelling units shall be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet to an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, if in the opinion of the P l a n n i n g a n d D e v e l o p m e n t D i r e c t o r , a sec- ond access could induce non- residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and street im- provements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to engineering. 909.05 Roadway Design. (a) Street Grades and Design Speeds. (1) Minimum grade for all local and minor collector streets shall be 1.5%. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia D.O.T. practice. (2) Minimum grade of less than 1.5% on a local street may be approved by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where such grades cannot rea- sonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with these Regulations. City of Duluth UDC Section 909 Performance Guidelines. 9-17 Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. (3) Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in the City of Duluth by street classification shall be as shown in Table 9-B. Table 9-B: Minimum Design Speeds and Maximum Grades Street Category Maximum Grade Design Speed Principal Arterial 6% 60 MPH Major Arterial 8% 50 MPH Minor Arterial 10% 50 MPH Major Collector 10% 40 MPH Minor Collector 10% 30 MPH Local 15% 20 MPH Note: Grades between 12% and 14% shall not exceed a length of 150 feet and shall require an "as graded" survey prior to the installation of the curb and utilities. The distance shall be measured as the tangent length between points of curvature. (4) Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be 6%. (b) Vertical Street Alignment. (1) All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than 1% shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in% (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). (2) Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 9-C for both desirable and minimum ac- ceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in Table 9-C as “minimum”. Table 9-C: Constant (K) Values for Vertical Curves Street Category Crest Curves Sag Curves Minimum Desirable Minimum Desirable Principal Arterial 200 320 125 155 Major Arterial 100 170 80 110 Minor Arterial 55 80 55 70 Major Collector 55 80 55 70 Minor Collector 30 30 35 35 Local 10 10 20 20  Section 909 Performance Guidelines. City of Duluth UDC 9-18 (c) Horizontal Street Alignment. (1) All new streets shall adhere to the following standards governing horizontal curvature and superelevation shown in Table 9-D. Table 9-D: Horizontal Curves Street Category Minimum Radius (FT) Max Superelevation Principal Arterial 1333 0.06 Major Arterial 833 0.06 Minor Arterial 560 0.04 Major Collector 560 0.04 Minor Collector 300 0.04* Local 120 0.00 * No Superelevation will be allowed on Minor Collectors internal to residential subdivisions. (2) Superelevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula:  v = vehicle design speed, (MPH) e = rate of superelevation (decimal of a 1-foot rise of 2 per foot of road- way) f = side friction factor, as fol- lows:  R =  v2   15 (e + f)  Vehicle Design Speed (v)           30 40 50 Side Friction Factor (f)            .16 .15 .14  (3) Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curva- ture and superelevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specif- ic design by the City, County or Georgia D.O.T. which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. (4) Superelevation Runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent runout (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and superelevation runoff (from the end of tangent runout to the point of design superelevation) in accordance with design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation or other professional engi- neering standards. (5) Tangents and Compound Curves. City of Duluth UDC Section 909 Performance Guidelines. 9-19 Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in Table 9-E unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. The "desirable" lengths shall be provided unless the developer can show that hardship due to topography or configuration of the property will not allow these lengths to be achieved, in which case the "minimum" lengths in Table 9-E may be permitted. For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to 1. Table 9-E: Tangents Street Category Minimum Tangent Length (feet) Desirable Tangent Length (feet) Major Arterial 125 150 Principal Arterial 150 180 Minor Arterial 100 120 Major Collector 100 120 Minor Collector 75 90 Local 50 60 Note: Minimum tangents are based on the distance traveled in 1.7 seconds at the design speed for each category of street. Desirable lengths of tangents are based on the distance traveled in 2.0 seconds at the design speed. (d) Horizontal and Vertical Clearances. (1) Horizontal Clearances. A shoulder of no less than 11 feet from the back of curb or edge of pavement, appropriately graded and having gentle slopes of not more than ½ inch per foot and rounded cross-sectional design shall be maintained along all streets. Beyond the shoulder but within the right-of-way, slopes shall not exceed 1 foot of rise for each 2 feet of horizontal distance on a cut slope, and 1 foot of fall for each 3 feet of horizontal distance on a fill slope. Along all public streets, a clear zone shall be provided for a minimum distance of 6 feet from back of curb or edge of roadway pavement. Nothing may be located above ground level in this clear zone except traffic control and street signs, public utility structures, mail boxes, City approved street trees and City approved land- scaping. At selected locations, such as the outside of a sharp curve, a wider clear zone with greater horizontal clearances provided to any roadside obstruction may be required. The Department of Transportation, in accordance with Georgia Law 32-6- 51, is authorized to remove or direct the removal of any sign, signal, device, or other  Section 909 Performance Guidelines. City of Duluth UDC 9-20 structure erected, placed, or maintained on the right-of-way of a public road which because of its nature, construction, or operation, constitutes a danger to, or interferes with the vision of, divers of motor vehicles. (2) Vertical Clearances. Vertical clearance at underpasses shall be at least 14.5 feet over the entire roadway width. 909.06 Street Intersections. (a) Angle of Intersection. Intersections shall generally be at right angles and shall not be at an angle of less than 85 degrees unless approved by the Department, nor less than 80 degrees unless the intersec- tion is signalized in which case the angle of the intersection may be reduced subject to the review and approval of Gwinnett County Traffic Engineering. (b) Maximum Grade. Street intersections should be designed with a flat grade wherever possible, but in no case should the grade exceed 2% in normal situations (or 4% in topographical hardship situa- tions on local streets). (c) Intersection Approaches: Horizontal Alignment. (1) New local streets which approach an intersection with a street of higher classification on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet in length. Minor collectors intersecting a major thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30-foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be meas- ured along the centerline of the intersecting from the right-of-way line of the inter- sected street, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section. (2) New major thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets of equal or higher classification as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds. (d) Intersection Approaches: Vertical Alignment. (1) For intersections with local or minor collector streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding 2% shall be provided but no level approach distance is required for streets approaching at less than 7%, and a minimum 25-foot level approach distance shall be provided for streets approaching at a grade in excess of 7% or more. (See Standard Drawings.) (2) As a street approaches an intersection with a major thoroughfare, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding 2% and for a distance not less than those shown in Table 9-F.   City of Duluth UDC Section 909 Performance Guidelines. 9-21 Table 9-F: Approach Distances at Major Intersections Approaching Street Category Minimum Approach Distance* (feet) Principal Arterial 100 Major Arterial 100 Minor Arterial 100 Major collector 75 Minor Collector 75 Local 50 *Distance of the approach is measured from edge of pavement of the intersected street to the point of curvature in the approaching street. (e) Intersection Radii. Intersection radii for roadways, measured at back of curb, and right-of-way lines shall be as shown in Table 9-G. For intersecting streets of difference classification, the larger radii shall be provided. In all cases, adequate right-of-way shall be provided to maintain a mini- mum of 11 feet from back-of-curb. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at angles less than 90 degrees. Table 9-G: Intersection Radii Street Category Roadway Radii (feet) Right-of-Way Radii (feet) Arterial 40 20 Major Collector 40 20 Minor Collector – Residential 25 9 Minor Collector – Non-Residential 40 20 Local – Residential 20 9 Local – Commercial or Office 25 11 Local – Industrial 40 25 Note: Intersecting right-of-way lines may be joined by an arc having the minimum radius shown, or by a miter which cuts across the right-of-way lines connecting the points where the required radius would have otherwise been tangent. Section 909 Performance Guidelines. City of Duluth UDC 9-22 (f) Islands. Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the standard draw- ings. In no case shall anything in an island extend more than 3 feet above the street grade within the right-of-way, except traffic regulatory devices and other infrastructure erected or approved by the City of Duluth. No island shall be approved which contains less than 100 square feet. (g) Intersection Corner Sight Distance. (1) Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance for each street which approaches a street in an equal or higher street classification (except an intersection of two local streets). Where necessary, backslopes shall be flattened and horizontal or verti- cal curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance. (2) The minimum corner sight distance from the approaching street shall be equal to or ex- ceed 10 times the regulated speed of the intersecting street, as measured from the center of the approaching street in both directions along the right-of-way line of the intersected street. As an alternative, the minimum corner sight distance requirement may be calculat- ed using AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, Chapter 9 (at- grade intersections), latest edition. The sight distance shall provide clear visibility of an ob- ject 4 feet above the intersected street viewed from the centerline of the approaching street, at a height of 3.5 feet above the ground. (h) Obstructing Visibility at Intersections. On any corner lot, within an area formed by the lot lines on the street sides of such lot and a line (miter) joining points on such lot lines located at a distance of 20 feet from the point of their in- tersection, the following shall apply: (1) There shall be no fence, or wall or hedge higher than 3 feet in height above the estab- lished grade of the intersecting streets. (2) There shall be no obstruction to vision, other than a post, column or tree not exceeding 1 foot in greatest cross-sectional dimension, between a height of 3 feet and a height of 15 feet above the established grade of either of the intersecting streets. (i) Turning Lanes at Intersections. Left turning lanes shall be provided on all new internal project streets, classified as a minor col- lector or major thoroughfare, intersecting a major thoroughfare. Such turning lanes may be re- quired at other locations to meet traffic demand and safe operations. Right turning lanes may be required to meet traffic demands or safety concerns. When provided, turning lanes shall meet the following criteria: (1) Storage length - A minimum of 150 feet of storage length for turning lanes on any arteri- al street shall be required. A minimum of 100 feet of storage length for turning lanes on all collectors shall be required. (2) Taper Length - The minimum taper length shall be 50 feet. (3) Left turning lanes from arterial roads shall be subject to longer storage lengths and ta- pers an as determined on a case by case basis. City of Duluth UDC Section 909 Performance Guidelines. 9-23 909.07 Driveway Intersections. (a) Angle and Improvements. Driveways shall generally intersect streets at right angles. The portion of a driveway located with- in a public right-of-way, if any, shall be paved. Driveways providing access to parking lots which contain six or more spaces shall be paved in accordance with the parking lot requirements of the Parking and Loading Requirements Article of this Code. (b) Driveway Design Standards. (1) Residential Driveways. Driveways serving single-family detached or duplex residences shall meet the following requirements: Driveways shall be paved between the street and the principal building. Driveways shall be no less than 10 feet wide at the right-of-way line, no less than 22 feet in length measured from the back the sidewalk or from the back of curb or edge of pavement if there is no sidewalk, and shall provide a radius to the back of curb or edge of pavement of the roadway of no less than 5 feet. Any other driveway curb cuts shall conform to the standards below. Townhouse driveways for adjoining units shall be separated by at least a 4-foot wide landscaped strip. (2) All driveways and driveway curb cuts on State highways shall conform to Georgia DOT standards unless City requirements are more re- strictive. Driveway Detail 1 (32-foot width, 25-foot radius) for: 1. Service Stations; 2. Commercial Sites (over 800,000 square feet); 3. Office/Institutional Complexes (over 100,000 square feet); 4. Apartment/Condominium Complexes (over 200 units); 5. Mobile Home Complexes (over 200 lots). Driveway Detail 2 (28-foot width, 25-foot radius) for: 1. Commercial Sites (80,000 square feet or less); 2. Office/Institutional Complexes (100,000 square feet or less); Measure driveway length beginning at the back of sidewalk (above) or the back of curb (below) if there is no sidewalk. Section 909 Performance Guidelines. City of Duluth UDC 9-24 3. Apartment/Condominium Complexes (199 units or less); 4. Manufactured Home Developments (199 lots or less). Driveway Detail 3 (32-foot width, 40-foot radius) for: 1. Industrial Sites Driveway Detail 4 (Optional Design with Island) for: 1. Private Commercial/Office Street Entrances; 2. Private Entrances to Apartment/Condominium Complexes (over 200 units); and 3. Private Entrances to Manufactured Home Developments (over 200 units). (c) Auxiliary Lanes. Along any major thoroughfare, a deceleration lane or acceleration lane, larger turning radius, traffic islands, or other devices or designs may be required to avoid specific traffic hazards which would otherwise be created by the proposed driveway location. (d) Corner Sight Distance. All driveways approaching a minor collector or major thoroughfare shall provide adequate cor- ner sight distance. The minimum corner sight distance from the driveway shall be equal to or exceed 10 times the regulated speed of the intersected street, as measured from the centerline of the driveway in both directions along the right-of-way line of the intersected street. As an al- ternative, the minimum corner sight distance requirement may be calculated using AASHTO Pol- icy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, Chapter 9 (at-grade intersections), latest edi- tion. The sight distance shall provide clear visibility of an object four feet above the intersected street viewed from the centerline of the driveway at the right-of- way line of the intersected street, at a height of 3.5 feet above the ground. (e) Separation and Spacing. All driveways except those serving single family residential units on individual lots, shall meet the following criteria: (1) Minimum separation from a street intersection: 100 feet from centerline of driveway to nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. For any driveway on a major thorough- fare having a centerline between 100 feet to 200 feet from the intersecting street right-of- way line, access restrictions, such as “right turn only,” may be imposed to avoid traffic haz- ards. Greater separation may be required for safe operation of a free right lane, accelera- tion or deceleration lane, etc. (2) Minimum separation between driveways along the same side of a major thoroughfare: 100 feet between centerlines as measured along the roadway edge or back of curb. (3) Whenever possible, proposed driveways along one side of a street shall coincide with exist- ing or proposed driveways on the opposite side of the street. (4) Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each 400 feet of property frontage, or part thereof per street, along a major thoroughfare.

In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. (4) Installation of poles and other wire holding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise pro- vided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wire holding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or struc- tures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own ex- pense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. (i) Restoration of Property. A utility shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure thereon, thereunder or thereover or adjacent thereto that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construction or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the work performed by the [event] that caused such disturbance or damage. If utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same. City of Duluth UDC Section 915 Utilities and Easements. 9-37 (j) Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities. (1) A utility who has discontinued or is discontinuing operation of any facilities in the city shall:  Provide information satisfactory to the city that the utility's obligations for its facilities in the rights-of-way under this Code Section and any other provision in the codified ordinances or other laws have been lawfully assumed by another utility;  Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities; Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities. Said proposal must be ap- proved by the Planning and Development Director;  Remove its entire facilities within a reasonable amount of time and in a manner ac- ceptable to the city; or  Submit to the city, in good faith and within a reasonable amount of time, a proposal for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If a utility proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option do one (1) or more of the following: 1. Purchase the facilities; 2. Accept donation of some or all facilities; or 3. Require the utility to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities. (2) Facilities of a utility who fails to comply with the above provision shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nui- sance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prose- cuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise at law or in equity. (k) Termination of Registration. (1) The registration statement shall remain in place for one year and renew each subsequent year automatically unless the utility is in default. The Planning and Development Director shall give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has:  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a registration application or any law of the city, state, or federal government;  Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this Code Section; Practiced any fraud or deceit upon city; or Made a material misrepresentation of fact in its application for registration. (2) If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the approval of registration. If the Planning and Development Director decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the fol- lowing procedure shall be followed:  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed ter- mination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. Section 916 Street Cuts. City of Duluth UDC 9-38 If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the registration terminated. (l) Unauthorized Use of Public Rights-of-Way. (1) No utility shall use the rights-of-way to operate any facilities that have not been authorized by the city in accordance with the terms of this Code Section. (2) No utility shall place or have placed any facilities in, on, above, within, over, below, under, or through the rights-of-way, unless allowed under this Code Section. (3) Each and every unauthorized use shall be deemed to be a violation and a distinct and sepa- rate offense. Each and every day any violation of this Code Section continues shall consti- tute a distinct and separate offense. (4) No utility shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Code Section. Each and every failure to comply shall be deemed a distinct and separate offense. Each and every day any viola- tion of this Code Section continues shall constitute a distinct and separate offense. (m) Other Provisions. (1) Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this Code Section, does not sur- render or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or which may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Georgia, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordi- nances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written approval of registration, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce gen- eral ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In par- ticular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. (2) Compliance. No utility shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this Code Section by reason of any failure of city to enforce prompt compliance. (3) Appeals. See the Appeals Article of this Development Code. Section 916. Street Cuts. (a) All utility construction plans within City right-of-way shall be reviewed and approved by the De- partment before construction begins.

Section 1004. Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using BMPs. 1004.01 General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if re- quirements of Division I of this Article and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by Division I of this Article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimen- tation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 1004.02 and Section 1004.03 of this Article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of Division I of this Article and the NPDES General Permit. 1004.02 Minimum Requirements; BMPs. (a) Best management practices as set forth in Section 1004.02and Section 1004.03of this Article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best man- agement practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (b) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper de- sign” and “properly designed” mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the “Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia” specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). (b) A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbid- ity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Direc- tor. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. (c) Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued  City of Duluth UDC Section 1004 Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using BMPs. 10-7 by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Con- trol Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. (d) The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and pru- dent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. (e) The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Section1004.03(o), Section 1004.03(p) and Section 1004.03(q), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 1004.03 Minimum Requirements; Specific. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as strin- gent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engi- neering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: (a) Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; (b) Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; (c) Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; (d) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; (e) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; (f) Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; (g) Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during devel- opment; (h) Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practica- ble; (i) To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. ; (j) Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; (k) Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; (l) Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to ad- versely affect other property owners; (m) Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;  Section 1004 Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using BMPs. City of Duluth UDC 10-8 (n) Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provi- sions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facil- ities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 1004.02(b) of this Article; (o) Except as provided in paragraph (p) and (q) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drain- age structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorpo- rated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:  (1) No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water qual- ity and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and (2) The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are im- plemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and (p) There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the “Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner’s property and the land- owner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The follow- ing requirements shall apply to such buffer:  City of Duluth UDC Section 1004 Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using BMPs. 10-9 (1) No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single–family residence, when such res- idence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and (2) The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are im- plemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. (q) There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the “Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970.” And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscap- ing, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, ade- quate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is con- structed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifica- tions and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention ba- sin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individ- ual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently dam- aged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. (1) No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single–family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own oc- cupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and  Section 1005 Application/Permit Process. City of Duluth UDC 10-10 (2) The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully imple- mented. (3) The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compli- ance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if road- ways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. (4) Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a “Minor Buffer Impact” as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabiliza- tion structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. (r) Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that ex- ceed the minimum requirements in Section 1004.02 and Section 1004.03 of this Article. (s) The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the prop- erty of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the stand- ards provided for in Division 1 of this Article or the terms of the permit. Section 1005. Application/Permit Process. 1005.01 General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be devel- oped and the area surrounding it. They shall consult this Development Code, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 1005.02 Application Requirements. (a) No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Duluth without first obtaining a permit from the City of Duluth to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable. (b) The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Duluth and must include the applicant’s erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 1005.03 of this Article. Erosion, sedimen- tation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section 1004.02 and Section 1004.03 of this Article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant’s erosion, sedimentation and pol- lution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the  City of Duluth UDC Section 1005 Application/Permit Process. 10-11 designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7- 10. (c) In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsec- tion (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturb- ing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a Local Issuing Authority in the jurisdiction. (d) Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local Issuing Authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the Dis- trict, and any variances required by Section 1004.03(o), Section 1004.03(p) and Section 1004.06(q) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per this Section 1005.02(f), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local Issuing Authority and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the Local Issuing Authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. The Local Issuing Au- thority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal. (e) If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, Division I of this Article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application. (f) The Local Issuing Authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of govern- ment security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with Division I of this Article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the Local Issuing Authority with respect to alleged permit violations. (1) The City of Duluth shall require the posting of a bond before any permits are granted pursuant to Division I of this Article. a. The required bond may be posted in any of the following methods or in a combination of methods: cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or government security. b. The required bond shall be in the amount of $3,000.00 per acre or portion of an acre dis- turbed. (2) The procedure for the forfeiture of the required bond for failure to comply with this Division I of this Article is set forth in Section 1007.03. 1005.03 Plan Requirements. Section 1006 Inspection and Enforcement. City of Duluth UDC 10-12 (a) Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section 1004.02 and Section 1004.03 of this Article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into Division 1 of this Article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrolog- ical characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stake- holder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. (b) Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the Commission as of Jan- uary 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 1005.04 Permits. (a) Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the Local Issuing Authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. (b) No permit shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollu- tion control plan has been approved by the District and the Local Issuing Authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with Division I of this Article, any variances required by Section 1004.03(o), Section 1004.03(p) and Section 1004.03(q) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 1004.03(f) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. (c) Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of Division I of this Article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the Division shall enforce such requirements upon the Local Issuing Authority. (d) If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. (e) The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the Local Issuing Authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of Division I of this Article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. (f) The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (f) (1). Section 1006. Inspection and Enforcement. (a) The City of Duluth will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the  City of Duluth UDC Section 1007 Penalties and Incentives. 10-13 Local Issuing Authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturb- ing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Ter- tiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with per- mit conditions, or with the provisions of Division I of this Article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of Division I of this Article. (b) The Local Issuing Authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. (c) The City of Duluth shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in Division I of this Article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and in- specting the sites of land-disturbing activities. (d) No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the Local Issuing Authority, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspec- tion, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. (e) The District or the Commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and munic- ipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a). The District or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county’s or municipality’s erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The District or the Commission shall notify the Division and request investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. (f) The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been cer- tified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to Code Section 12-7-8 (a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority’s or- dinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the govern- ing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality cer- tified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a Local Issuing Authority.

(a) In exercising the zoning powers granted to the Mayor and City Council by State Law, the City Council shall apply the following standards in making zoning decisions: (1) Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and devel- opment of adjacent and nearby property. (2) Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. (3) Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use that will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools. (4) Whether the zoning proposal is consistent with the Land Use Policy Plan, Comprehensive Plan, transportation plans, or other plans adopted for guiding development within the City of Duluth. (5) Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of property that give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning or special use proposal. (b) Standards for review of a Planned Unit Development rezoning, in addition to those enumerated under paragraph (a), above, are found in Article 5 of this Development Code. 1104.03 Conditional Approval. (a) In adopting a map amendment or approving a special use, the Planning Commission may rec- ommend and the City Council may impose special conditions which they deem necessary in or- der to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the proposed uses of the dis- trict(s) involved and to further the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Such condi- tions may consist of: setback requirements from any lot line; specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other land uses, driveway curb cut restrictions; maximum provisions; landscaping or planted area which may include the berms, or other buffer- ing provisions or protective measures; measures to alleviate undesirable views, light, glare, noise, dust or odor; permitted hours of operation; architectural style; a requirement that devel- opers must build according to site plans as adopted; a limitation on exterior modifications of ex- isting buildings; and on and off-street traffic improvements necessary to carry traffic generated by the proposed development.

(3) Shall be required of the property owner and subsequent owners as a condition of their use of the property. (4) Shall be permitted and continuously enforced by the Planning and Development Director in the same manner as any other provision of this Development Code. Section 1105 Special Use Considerations. City of Duluth UDC 11-8 1104.04 Change in Conditions of Approval. Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously established by the City Council through action on a rezoning or special use shall be considered a new application and therefore subject to all procedures and provisions of this Division I regarding the approval of a map amendment or special use, as applicable. Section 1105. Special Use Considerations. (a) The special use is designed to apply under any one of the following circumstances: (1) A special use listed under the zoning district is desired for development and a more inten- sive zoning district containing that use, as a use by right would not be appropriate for the property; or (2) A special use listed under the zoning district is desired for development and no zoning dis- trict contains that use as a use by right; or (3) A unique use not addressed in any zoning district is desired for development and is not like- ly to be duplicated within the City of Duluth; or (4) The density of development may be affected by the height of a building; or (5) The neighboring properties may be affected by the height of any structure; or (6) The special use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood or the community as a whole, be compatible with the neighborhood and would not be in conflict with the overall objective of the Comprehensive Plan. (b) In order to accommodate these particular uses, special use approval allows the City Council to approve such a use on a particular parcel without changing the general zoning district. Such ap- proval shall be subject to the requirements set forth below and any additional conditions deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the special use with the surrounding proper- ties. All special use applications shall be for firm development proposals only. The special use shall not be used for securing early zoning for conceptual proposals that may not be undertaken for some time. A special use application shall be considered only if the application is made by the owner of the property or by his/her authorized agent. The minimum requirements for a spe- cial use approval are: (1) Any uses allowed under special use approval shall also conform to the requirements of this Development Code for all uses as found in the zoning district. (2) The application and review process for a special use shall be the same as for the zoning dis- trict under which the special use is found. In addition to the information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional information deemed necessary by the Director in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted. In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to the evaluation of the characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to its immediate neighborhood and the compatibility of the proposed use with its neighborhood. (3) In the approval process for a special use approval application, the City Council shall consid- er the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially in regards but not limited to traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities. City of Duluth UDC Section 1106 Withdrawal. 11-9 (4) If an application is approved and a special use approval is granted, all conditions that may have been attached to the approval are binding to the property. All subsequent develop- ment and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and condi- tions. (5) Changes to a special use or development of a site for the special use, shall be treated as an amendment to the special use Permit and shall be subject to the same application and re- view process as a new application. (6) An application for special use approval in a residential district and which use is proposed to operate in a dwelling or as an accessory use to a dwelling is subject to the following addi- tional requirements: a. The special use shall operate within the dwelling on the property or, if approved by the City Council, in an accessory structure. b. The exterior character of the dwelling shall be preserved in its residential state and there shall be no outside evidence of the operation of a special use to the neighbor- hood, except for any accessory structure approved by the City Council. (7) The owner of the property approved for a special use may voluntarily request termination of the special use by notifying the Director in writing. The Director shall notify the City Council through the Planning Commission of the voluntary termination. The approval of a special use for a specific use which may be operated by a lessee under a private agreement with a lessor in any non-residential district shall not obligate the City Council to be respon- sible for or be required to resolve any disputes which may arise out of the voluntary termi- nation of the special use by the property owner. (8) The Planning and Development Department shall have the right to periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine compliance with the requirements and any con- ditions. If the Planning and Development Director determines that the requirements and conditions are being violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the property outlining the nature of the violation and giving the owner of the property a maximum of ten days to come into compliance. If after ten days the violations continue to exist, the Di- rector shall forward a report to the City Council through the Planning Commission who may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use from the property. (9) Upon approval by the City Council, a special use shall be identified on the official zoning maps. (10) Upon approval by the City Council of a special use, the owner of the property shall be is- sued a notice from the Director that states the specific use permitted, the requirements of this Section and any conditions attached to the approval. (11) The Planning and Development Department shall not issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the special use approval have been fulfilled by the owner of the property. Section 1106. Withdrawal. Any applicant wishing to withdraw an application prior to final action by the City Council shall file a written request for withdrawal with the Planning and Development Director. Section 1107 Applications for a Map Amendment or Special Use Approval. City of Duluth UDC 11-10 (a) The withdrawal request must be in writing and signed by the owner, the applicant or the own- er’s authorized agent. (b) If the request for withdrawal is received prior to the publication of notice for the public hearing as required under Section 1103.04, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the Planning and Development Director. (c) If a request for withdrawal of an application is received after notice has been published (or irre- trievably set for publication) but before the scheduled Planning Commission public meeting, the application may be withdrawn with the consent of the Planning Commission and removed from further consideration. (d) Should any request for withdrawal be made after the public meeting by the Planning Commis- sion, the application shall remain on the City Council agenda and the withdrawal request shall be considered for approval or denial by the City Council.

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that ___________________________ , hereinafter referred to as “Principal,” and ____________________________ , a ______________ Corporation authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, hereinafter referred to as “Insurer,” hereby declare that: 1. We are held and firmly bound unto the City of Duluth, Georgia (hereinafter referred to as the “City”) in the full and just sum of $__________________________ , lawful money of the United States of America, payable to the City under the terms of this Bond, and we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by this Bond. 2. This Bond shall be void if the Principal performs, in every respect, all of its obligations with regard to the subject improvements listed herein. Otherwise, this Bond shall continuously remain in full force and effect until released by the City. 3. (A) It shall be the duty of the Principal to notify Insurer of any revision to the plans, profiles and specifications of the subject improvements. Except as otherwise provided herein, Insurer expressly waives any right to receive no- tice from the City or to review or approve any revisions to the plans, profiles and specifications of the subject im- provements that are required to meet City, State or federal standards. No such revisions of any kind in the work shall in any way affect the obligation of the Insurer under this Bond; except that the Principal shall submit to the Insurer for review and approval, and the Insurer shall have the right to review and approve, any such revision that: (1) Grants the Principal any extension of time beyond the period provided for in the Agreement for com- pletion of the subject improvements under the Agreement; (2) Increases the cost of remaining construction of the subject improvements required under the Agree- ment by more than ten percent of the original sum of the Bond, as established by the estimate of Princi- pal; provided, however, that the Insurer shall be in all cases conclusively bound for purposes of this sub- paragraph by the estimate rendered by the Principal to the City as to the cost of any such revision.

(D) In the event of a default (as defined in paragraph 4(A) of this Bond), the City may terminate whatever rights Principal and/or Insurer may have, to perform further work on the project. 4. (A) A default shall be deemed to have occurred on the part of the Principal, if Principal shall fail to complete the subject improvements under the Agreement within the time set forth therein or any extensions thereof; or, prior to the expiration of such period, if in the sole judgment of the Authorized City Official, the Principal has: (1) Abandoned or unnecessarily delayed the performance of its obligations under the Agreement; or, (2) Renounced or repudiated its obligations under the Agreement; or, (3) Clearly demonstrated through insolvency, delay or otherwise, that its obligations under the Agreement cannot be completed within the time allotted under the Agreement; or, (4) Not complied with or is not in compliance with the minimum standards of the Unified Development Code of the City of Duluth, Georgia, for any one or more of the subject improvements.

In the event of such default and notice, Insurer shall within 30 calendar days of receipt of the default notice, give written re- sponse notice to the Authorized City Official stating whether it will assume or decline to assume the obligations of the Principal for completion of the subject improvements; and should it elect to assume said obligations Insurer shall be required to complete the subject improvements to the satisfaction of the City within 30 calendar days of said response notice or the date of completion of the subject improvements provided for under the Agreement, whichever is later. In the event that Insurer elects to assume the obligations of Principal as provided herein and thereafter fails to faithfully perform all or any part of the work, or should it unnecessarily delay all or any part of the work, the City may proceed as provided in paragraph 5 of the Bond. 5. Should Insurer, following notice of default, notify the City that it elects not to assume the obligations of Principal for completion of the subject improvements under the Agreement; or fails within 30 calendar days of receipt of the default notice as provided in paragraph 4 above to notify the City whether it elects to assume the obligations of Principal; or having elected to assume the obligations of Principal should it then fail to perform; then in either event the City may elect any of the following procedures or any combination thereof: (A) Terminate whatever rights Principal and/or Insurer may have to perform further work on the project. (B) Make demand on the Insurer for cash payment to be rendered immediately, but in no case less than five business days, and without further action, in the total amount of the Bond less the actual cost of the subject im- provements expended as of the date of demand.

Insurer shall have the right, at any time within 30 days of the default notice provided for in 4(B) hereof, to re- quest that the Authorized City Official determine a sum constituting the total amount of the Bond less the actual cost of the subject improvements expended as of the date of demand (as evidenced by invoices and proof of payments acceptable to the Authorized City Official as to reasonableness, but not including payments for inade- quate or improper construction), as of that time. Should it so elect, Insurer may then pay over to the City the sum so determined and be released from any further obligations under this Bond. If funds are paid over under this sec- tion and the paid-over funds are not sufficient to complete the work, the City's sole remedy shall be to proceed against the Principal for any deficiency. 7. If any action or proceeding is initiated in connection with this bond and any and all obligations arising hereun- der, the venue thereof shall be the City of Duluth, Georgia, and it is further understood and agreed that this con- tract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, both as to interpretation and performance. 8.

If the address of the Principal or Insurer changes, the Principal or Insurer shall immediately notify the Authorized City Official in writing of such change. Failure to notify the Authorized City Official of any change in address is deemed to be a waiver of any requirement for notice under this Bond to the Principal or Insurer. All written notice to the City required under this Bond shall be sent certified mail and addressed to the Authorized City Official with a copy to the City Attorney. 9. If any one or more of the provisions of this Bond are determined to be illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other provisions shall remain in effect. 10. The Principal, his agents, employees or contractors, will comply with the applicable ordinances, laws, regula- tions and requirements of the City, including the Unified Development Code of the City of Duluth. 11. The Principal will hold harmless the City or any of its officers from any expense incurred through the failure of the Principal to perform or complete its obligations under the Agreement, or from any damages growing out of the negligence of the Principal, or his agents, employees or contractors. 12. Approval of this Bond by the City of Duluth Mayor and City Council shall be deemed acceptance without fur- ther notice to the Principal and/or Insurer. 13. The failure of the City to enforce or timely comply with any provision of this Bond shall not be deemed a waiv- er of the obligation of the Principal and Insurer hereunder. 14. Upon completion of the subject improvements, all monies due to third parties for such work will have been paid (or if not will be the responsibility of the Principal), that the improvements will be free and clear of any liens or encumbrances and that any liens or encumbrances subsequently filed on such facilities and improvements cov- ered herein shall be the sole responsibility of the Principal. 15. The provisions and obligations of this Bond shall be controlled by and interpreted by the provisions and re- quirements of the Unified Development Code of the City of Duluth, Georgia, in effect as of the date of execution of this Bond by the Principal and Insurer.
