. It is not the intent of this section that control of the design of a PUD by the planning commission be so rig- idly exercised that individual initiative be stifled and substantial additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this sec- tion. . The planning commission shall be authorized to approve or disapprove an application for a PUD. In an approval, the commission shall be permitted to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to secure compliance with the purposes set forth in this chapter. The denial of an application for a PUD by the planning com- mission shall be permitted to be appealed to the legislative body of the jurisdiction. SECTION 1304 REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS 1304.1 General. The legislative body, as part of the approval of a PUD, shall be permitted to require an applicant to make reasonable contributions to include, but not limited to any combination of the following: 1. 2. 3. Dedication of land for public park purposes. Dedication of land for public school purposes. Dedication of land for public road right-of-way pur- poses. . Construction of, or addition to, roads serving the pro- posed project when such construction or addition is rea- sonably related to the traffic to be generated. 5. Installation of required traffic safety devices. . Preservation of areas containing significant natural, environmental, historic, archeological or similar resources. SECTION 1305 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION 1305.1 Approval. The planning commission shall have the authority to require that the following conditions for a 50 planned unit development (among others it deems appropri- ate) be met by the applicant: 1. That the proponents intend to start construction within 1 year of either the approval of the project or of any necessary zoning district change, and intend to com- plete said construction, or approved stages thereof, within 4 years from the date construction begins. 2. That the development is planned as one complex land use rather than as an aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses. 1305.2 Limitations on application. 1. Upon approval of a PUD, construction shall proceed only in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the planning commission and in compli- ance with any conditions attached by the jurisdiction as to its approval. . Amendment to approved plans and specifications for a PUD shall be obtained only by following the proce- dures here outlined for first approval. 3. The code official shall not issue any permit for any pro- posed building, structure or use within the project unless such building, structure or use is in accordance with the approved development plan and with any con- ditions imposed in conjunction with its approval. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  CHAPTER 14 REFERENCED STANDARDS This chapter lists the standards that are referenced in various sections of this document.
