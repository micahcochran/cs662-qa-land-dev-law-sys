An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitations. The various zones are defined as follows:  Page 35 of 51 a. Runway 04 Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. b. Runway 22 Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. c. Transitional Zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. d. Horizontal Zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways from the center end of the primary surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. e. Conical Zone: The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. Page 36 of 51 6-11-2 Airport zone height limitations Except as otherwise provided in Section 6-11, no structure, including a mobile object, shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this Ordinance to a height in excess of the applicable height herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are established for each of the zones in question as follows: a. Runway 04 Approach Zone: Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. b.

Article IV Section A  Site Design Standards Open Space FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 31       Article IV  Site Design Standards  A. Open Space B. Screening, Lighting and Landscape Material C. Streetscape D. Site Access and Internal Circulation E. Parking F. Stormwater Management G. Tree Preservation    This Article provides site design standards for seven key elements that are part of most development sites: open space; screening, lighting, and landscape material; streetscape; site access and internal circulation; parking; stormwater management; and signs. The standards are intended to contribute to the ability of development sites to integrate into the City’s overall plan. The standards and guidelines in this article should be applied in every zoning district and to every site design to the extent that the component is required by any development regulation or is otherwise proposed as part of the site plan or development. These design standards should be applied in addition to any specific area or design standards contained in other sections for a particular zoning district. A. Open Space  1. Intent  The open space design standards are intended to provide design solutions that ensure each area of open space serves a specific function and is not merely left over or under-utilized space. The design standards are also intended to provide greater access to a wider variety of open spaces. These design standards are to be applied to any area used to meet specific area requirements of the zoning districts and subdivision regulations for open space or greenspace. 2. Types of Open Space  The following Table 4-1 indicates the categories, types, and general sizes of open space that can be used to meet the City requirements for open space and greenspace. Generally there are two categories – Natural and Civic. Natural open space is most appropriate in neighborhoods, rural areas, or at the edges of village developments. It can also be used at any location where significant natural features warrant preservation. Civic open space is most appropriate in convenient locations, easily accessible by a large number of people. Typically this will be at the center of a residential neighborhood or in a village or commercial center. Article IV Section A  Site Design Standards Open Space FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 32  Table 4-1: Open Space Categories and Types   Category  Type  Description Size Recommendation  Image N A T U R A L O P E N S P A C E     Preserve  An undeveloped area that contains significant natural features or habitat worthy of preservation. Features such as large stands of trees, water elements, or prominent topography characterize preserves. A preserve may by use for passive recreation or as a scenic and visual buffer. It generally contains little or no constructed improvements although trails may access the preserve. The size of a Preserve open space should be based on the site characteristics and potential continuity of natural features in the area along with the potential to connect to adjacent natural areas. Trail / Greenway  An undeveloped area of continuous linear natural features, often following a stream or floodplain. A trail or greenway should be usable for recreation and non-motorized transportation. It includes few constructed improvements except for those to enhance travel or recreational use. Generally should include at least 3 acres but should be sized and located based on providing significant continuity throughout a development and to areas beyond the development area. Must be at least 30’ wide at all locations. Park  An undeveloped natural area for unstructured recreation. A park may include some areas for structured recreation, such as ball fields, but generally this area should occupy no more than 25% of the total area. Parks are located based on the presence of natural features or based on convenience for surrounding residents. A park has a predominantly natural landscape although portions may be designed for aesthetic and recreation purposes, particularly for parks located due to convenience. At least 3 acres    Article IV Section A  Site Design Standards Open Space FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 33  Table 4-1: Open Space Categories and Types (continued)   Category  Type  Description Size Recommendation  Image C IV IC O P E N S P A C E     Green   An open space for unstructured recreation or aesthetic landscaping. A green is bordered by public right-of-ways on at least 2 sides, front building facades, and formal landscaped elements to define its boundaries. Generally there are few constructed elements except as a formal entry to or a focal point for the green. ¼ to 3 acres     Plaza  An open space for civic purposes and commercial activities. A plaza is bordered by public right- of-ways on at least 2 sides, and building facades to define its boundaries. It is largely constructed of materials to withstand heavy pedestrian traffic, but contains intermittent lawns, landscape beds, or trees in a formal pattern. 1/8 to 2 acres  The size of plazas is generally determined by the height of surrounding buildings, maintaining between a 1:3 and 1:6 ratio of building height to plaza. Courtyard  A small open space accessible to the public but generally serving one or a few surrounding buildings. Courtyards are primarily bordered by building facades, but have at least one side fully or partially boarded by a public right-of-way. Courtyards are often constructed of materials to withstand heavy pedestrian traffic, but contain intermittent formal landscape elements. 1000 square feet to 1/8 acre  The size of courtyards is generally determined by the height of surrounding buildings, maintaining a between a 2:1 and 1:3 ratio of building height to courtyard. Playground  Open space designed and equipped for structured recreation. Playgrounds are often boarded by a fence or other private boundary (as in the case of a playground internal to a block) but are accessible by common pedestrian path. Alternatively, playgrounds included as part of a larger civic or natural open space do not necessarily have borders. 1000 square feet to ¼ acres. A playground may be part of larger civic or natural open space. Article IV Section B  Site Design Standards Screening, Lighting, and Landscape Material FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 34   B. Screening, Lighting and Landscape Material  1. Intent  The screening, lighting, and landscape material sections are intended to create a quality community image, minimize the impact of development on adjacent sites, allow property owners to create comfortable and appropriate private environments, and integrate all development into the overall community plan. 2. Screening  a. In any district, all mechanical or operating equipment, materials, or activities not contained within a building, such as drive-through equipment, outdoor storage of materials, stationary machinery, and outdoor servicing activities, shall be enclosed by a wall or fence of solid appearance or tight evergreen hedge not less than six feet in height. If the owner elects to build a wall or fence of bare or severe appearance it shall be enhanced with the planting of shrubs. b. In any district where a commercial/industrial use abuts a residential use, screening/buffering shall be required. Acceptable screening/buffering shall include a wall or fence of solid appearance, or tight evergreen hedge not less than six feet (6’) in height and a twenty foot (20’) landscaped buffer containing at least one (1) overstory tree and five (5) shrubs per every twenty-five linear feet (25’). 3. Parking Lot/Open Area Lighting  Parking lots with 50 or fewer spaces and open area requiring lighting for general purposes shall have light poles that do not exceed 10 feet overall height. Parking lots having more than 50 spaces shall have light poles that do not exceed 20 feet overall height. Luminaries of a sharp cut off design to shield light source above 72 degrees from vertical and providing 1.0 average maintained foot-candles with the following uniformity ratios: 3:1 average/minimum * (.33 FC minimum), 12:1 maximum/minimum * (4.0 FC maximum) are required in all cases. Public facilities such as lighted ball fields are excluded. A photometric grid shall be furnished by developer at time of building permit application. * maximum or minimum foot-candle level at any point lighted area. 4. Landscape Materials  All un-built yards and open space required by this ordinance, and all natural screening material, shall be planted according to the specifications of the City landscape ordinance. 5. Fencing and/or Walls  a. Fences and/or walls are permitted in every zoning district. A building permit shall be obtained prior to construction of any fence. Fences and/or walls may be permitted on the property lines or anywhere else on the lot provided that: (1) Fences and/or walls shall not be constructed in a drainage easement, floodway, or other watercourse; and (2) Fences and/or walls shall not be constructed in any required clear sight distance. b. Fences and/or walls in all residential zoning districts are subject to the following requirements: (1) No fence and/or walls shall be higher than eight (8’) feet. Any fence and/or walls forward of the front building line shall not be higher than four (4’) feet; (2) No corrugated metal sheets, solid sheets of metal, plywood, particleboard, or similar materials shall be allowed; and  Article IV Section B  Site Design Standards Screening, Lighting, and Landscape Material FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 35  (3) No barbed wire, razor wire, or similar materials shall be allowed except for fences used for agricultural purposes in the R-A – Residential/Agriculture zone. c. Fences and/or walls in all non-residential zoning districts are subject to the following: (1) No fence and/or walls shall be higher than 12 feet. Any fence and/or walls in front of the front building line shall be limited to between two and one-half and four feet high and shall have a design style consistent with the architectural elements of the buildings on the site. (2) No corrugated metal sheets, solid sheets of metal, plywood, particleboard, barbed wire, razor wire, or similar materials shall be allowed. C. Streetscape  1. Intent  Streetscape refers to the area between building facades on opposite sides of the street. It consists of public rights-of-way and private but publicly visible space. The streetscape site design standards are intended to create a smooth transition from the public realm to the private realm, provide a pleasant pedestrian experience, improve the appearance and function of the public rights-of-way, and reinforce and enhance the perception of the City as a unique and livable community. See Figure 4 –1. 2. Frontage Types  The following Table 4-2 indicates frontage types that make up the private portion of the streetscape. In zoning districts where specific setbacks are specified, any frontage type within that range may be used. In zoning districts where specific frontage types are specified, the frontage types may be used within the acceptable setbacks listed in this section and in the zoning district standards. Figure 4–1. Streetscape refers to all areas visible from the street and fronting buildings, and may consist of public or private property. Article IV Section C  Site Design Standards Streetscape FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 36    Table 4-2: Frontage Types  Frontage Building line* Description Image   Yard  20’ minimum 40’ maximum  Estate dwelling units and Civic uses with a yard frontage shall have no maximum depth for the front building line. A frontage with the building set back from the right- of-way line. The yard area is most appropriately used for landscape materials, natural vegetation, or focal points such as art or sculptures. The yard frontage is most appropriate in rural settings, residential neighborhoods, for residential uses along arterial streets where a buffer is desired, and for civic land uses in any setting. Terrace   8’ minimum 20’ maximum  A frontage with the buildings separated from the right-of-way by a slightly elevated garden or small yard. The terrace area is most appropriately used for landscape materials and entry elements, such as stairways, gateways or small fences or hedges. The terrace frontage is most appropriate in residential neighborhoods or areas of steeper topography. Courtyard  10’ minimum 20’ maximum  A portion of the building, typically more than 50% of the front façade) should be built at or near the right-of- way line  A frontage with a portion of the building close to the right-of-way line, while the remaining potion is setback from the right-of-way line, providing a pocket of open area in the courtyard. The courtyard area is most appropriately used for landscape material or constructed patios for pedestrian traffic. The courtyard frontage is most appropriate on higher-density residential blocks or for businesses that can utilize formal outdoor space. Stoop  8’ minimum 15’ maximum  A frontage with the building close to the right-of- way line but with the first floor slightly elevated (typically 3 to 5 feet) to ensure privacy to occupants of the building. Typically the closer the building line is to the right-of-way, the higher the elevation of the first floor should be. The setback area is most appropriately used with an ornamental stair and entranceway to the buildings, potentially with a small usable space at the top. The remaining portion of the setback area can include a small area of landscape material. The stoop frontage is most appropriate for higher-density residential blocks, or residential buildings mixed on blocks with non- residential buildings. Street-front  0’ minimum 10’ maximum  A frontage with the building at the right-of-way line or slightly set back from the right-of-way line. The ground level of the building is predominantly transparent and available to uses serving the public, thus providing varied and interesting environment to pedestrians. Any setback area is typically designed seamlessly with the right-of-way with either expanded sidewalks, landscape beds, street-front seating, or a covered walkway. The street-front frontage is most appropriate for non-residential uses in pedestrian-oriented areas. Article IV Section C  Site Design Standards Streetscape FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 37  * The building line expresses the general acceptable range for distances of principal buildings from the right-of-way. This range shall apply unless a more specific set back or build to line is specified for a particular zoning district. D. Site Access and Internal Circulation  1. Intent  Site access and internal circulation standards are intended to balance the need for site-access by vehicles with pedestrian movements. Design elements are intended to create a smooth transition from the public rights-of-way to the private property, and to improve the appearance and function of the public rights-of-way for all users including pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles. 2. Curb Cuts  Curb cuts for property not being subdivided shall be allowed according to the same Lot Access standards established in the Fairhope Subdivision Regulations. When the development process requires access standards different from those standards, either from a traffic study or through a subdivision waiver process, the revised standards shall comply with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, the Subdivision Regulations, and this ordinance. Any special access conditions for particular uses are indicated in Article III., Section D., and any special access conditions for particular zoning districts are listed in Article VI. 3. Internal Driveways, Aisles and Driveway Lanes  All driveways shall be set back a minimum distance of three feet from the side lot line, except where shared access driveways are provided. To the extent practical, all internal driveway aisles should be designed and dimensioned as closely as possible to the public street standards in the Fairhope Subdivision Regulations, including sidewalks, planting strips, and parking lanes. 4. Clear sight lines  Clear sight lines shall be maintained for all lot access points and internal circulation intersections in accordance with the standards for public street intersections specified in the Fairhope Subdivision Regulations. 5. Off-Street Loading/Unloading  Off-street loading/unloading spaces shall be provided according to the following:  a. Size of Spaces: Each off-street loading/unloading space shall have minimum dimensions of 14 feet in height, 12 feet in width, and 55 feet in length. However, upon sufficient demonstration that a particular loading space will be used exclusively by shorter trucks, the board of adjustment may reduce the minimum length accordingly to as little as 35 feet. b. Connection to Street or Lane: Each required off-street loading/unloading space shall have direct access to a street or lane, or have a driveway which offers satisfactory ingress and egress for trucks. c. Required spaces: All non-residential buildings with uses requiring the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise shall provide at least one off-street loading/unloading space per each 10,000 square feet , or fraction thereof, of floor area located on the same lot as the building or use. Adjacent buildings or uses of less than 10,000 square feet may share loading/unloading spaces within 300 feet of the loading/unloading entrance. All off-street loading/unloading spaces shall be located to not hinder free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street, or lane. Article IV Section D  Site Design Standards Site Access and Internal Circulation FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 38  d. Permanent Reservation: Areas reserved for off-street loading/unloading in accordance with the requirement of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which is served is discontinued or modified unless alternate and equivalent loading/unloading space is provided and approved by the board of adjustment. E. Parking  1. Intent  Parking standards are intended to provide adequate access and vehicle storage for land uses, but also minimize negative impacts of large expanses of parking such as poor pedestrian environments, degraded community aesthetics, additional stormwater runoff from excess impervious surfaces, and under-utilized space. 2. Required Parking  The following Table 4-3 is the parking schedule and represents the minimum required parking spaces for specific land uses. These standards shall apply in any district the use is allowed, or permitted by special exception. These standards shall not apply to the CBD Overlay, where on-street parking is permitted. However, wherever practicable, businesses in the CBD Overlay are encouraged to provide off-street parking facilities. Any specific use or district condition in Article III of this ordinance shall apply along with the standards and conditions of this Section. Any area reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use, which it serves, is discontinued or modified, or alternate and equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the board of adjustment.

F. Stormwater Management  1. Intent  The intent of this section is to provide for stormwater management in site design. The primary management strategy should be infiltration of all runoff created by development through natural systems and constructed natural systems. Should infiltration not address stormwater management for the site adequately, retention and detention of run-off will be required. This section also seeks to incorporate any stormwater management system into the design of the site as a natural or aesthetic amenity. 2. General Requirements  All site plans shall be designed with surface drainage provisions in accordance with the Fairhope Subdivision Regulations, construction, building, or grading permits, and any other City ordinance regarding the effects of stormwater. Developers shall take steps necessary to prevent run-off, which may have the potential for causing flood damage to neighboring property. The building inspector shall, in consultation with the city engineer, determine that reasonable provisions for properly handling surface drainage have been made in the applicant’s design, and will report these findings for the Fairhope Planning Commission’s consideration in acting on building applications. If reasonable provisions are not made in the applicant’s design, the Fairhope Planning Commission shall make the remedies available to the applicant a condition of the approval, or deny the application. “Dry wells,” biofilters, or other constructed infiltration systems may be required of sufficient capacity to receive up to four inches per hour rainfall on the paved area or areas required for off-street parking and loading. Rainfall intensity to be calculated on storm frequency determined by the commission and/or its consultants. 3. Design Standards  Storm water detention shall be screened from direct view from all abutting properties by installation and maintenance of living plants at least 36 inches in height at time of planting, and achieve a height of not less than six feet in three years after planting. Outer slopes of detention ponds shall not be steeper than four feet horizontal to one-foot vertical. Where water depth and time of detention is sufficient to require safety fencing, such fencing shall be installed behind required screening, on the pond side. 4. Alternative Designs   Article IV Section F  Site Design Standards Stormwater Management FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 42  Standards of this ordinance and any standard of this ordinance that relates to the City of Fairhope Subdivision Regulations may be waived to provide for an alternative stormwater design system provided that: a. The alternative stormwater design provides for an infiltration system that incorporates at least 80% of the runoff from impervious surfaces into the groundwater on the site and results in an overall reduction in impacts on streams in the watershed. b. The alternative stormwater design addresses stormwater on an area-wide or watershed basis making stormwater management on individual lots within the site unnecessary. c. Natural elements on the site are incorporated into a natural storm drain infrastructure minimizing or eliminating the need for detention ponds and other constructed storm drainage. Constructed elements of the natural drainage system shall be limited to artificial wetlands, bio-filters, and dry swales. To the extent that it does not damage the function of the natural drainage system, natural elements should serve additional community purposes such as trails or greenways, parks, or aesthetic screens. d. Any waiver of standard to accommodate the alternative stormwater design proposes an equal or better alternative for meeting the intent of the waived standard. e. The alternative stormwater design is accompanied by a plan produced by a registered engineer testifying to its accuracy and sustainability. f. The alternative stormwater design plan included provisions for long-term maintenance and operation of the alternative design, including easements, covenants, restrictions, and an acceptable legal entity to oversee long-term maintenance. g. The alternative stormwater design plan shall accompany a site plan for the entire development. The plan and any waivers to the standards of this ordinance shall be approved according to the procedures and standards for the site plan. Article IV Section G  Site Design Standards Tree Preservation FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 43   G. Tree Preservation  On a site where a live Heritage Tree exists, the Planning and Building Director may grant up to a seven foot (7’) administrative setback variance in order to protect and/or preserve an existing Heritage Tree as defined in Article IX, Section C. of this Ordinance. The only types of Heritage Trees protected under this Ordinance shall include:  Various Oak Trees (Quercus Species), Cedar Trees, Cypress Trees, Magnolia Trees and any other unusual species identified as a desirable tree by the City Horticulturist. In an effort to preserve the critical root areas for existing trees on public and private properties, trenching is not allowed within nine feet (9’) of any property line. One may use a directional boring (Horizontal Directional Drilling – HDD) method of service installation within the 9’ no-trenching setback. Article V Section A.

Special Districts AO – Airport Overlay FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 53 E. AO – Airport Overlay  1. Intent and Authority – The Airport overlay promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by preventing the creation and establishment of land uses incompatible with the operations of the Fairhope Municipal Airport and requiring the incorporation of outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation measures for the construction of certain structures within the boundary of the Airport Overlay District Zone. The Airport Overlay is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Title 4, Chapter 6, Section 1 through 15, Code of Alabama, 1975. 2. Findings – The City finds that certain land uses are incompatible with noise generated by aircraft using the Fairhope Municipal Airport and that these land uses have the potential to impair the existing and future utility of the Fairhope Municipal Airport and the public investment in the Airport. Accordingly, it is declared: a. That the establishment and construction of noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential of limiting the existing and future utility of the airport and may adversely affect the region served by the Fairhope Municipal Airport; b. That noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential to become land uses incompatible with airport operations over time and it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of incompatible land uses be prevented. c. The prevention of the creation or establishment of incompatible land uses, and the elimination, removal, alteration, and mitigation of incompatible land uses are public purposes. d. That land in the vicinity of the airport has the potential of being exposed to sound levels of 65 Ldn and higher. e. That the construction of certain noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport should include outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation features to ensure compatibility with existing and future noise levels. f. That the Fairhope Municipal Airport fulfills an essential community purpose. g. The Airport overlay promotes the implementation of modest measures that will prevent conflicts between future residential homeowners and the airport that could require expensive retroactive noise insulation programs, residential relocation programs, and restrictions on the efficient operation of the Fairhope Municipal Airport. 3. Applicability – The Airport overlay is applicable to all lands lying within the Airport Overlay District Zone, which is delineated on the Fairhope Municipal Airport Overlay Zoning Map adopted as part of the Airport Overlay District Zoning Ordinance of the City of Fairhope, Alabama. 4. Noise Requirements - Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, noise sensitive structures shall incorporate outdoor-to-indoor noise level reduction measures into the design and/or construction of the structure. a. Noise Attenuation Performance Standards – The performance standard for the level of sound attenuation for noise sensitive structures constructed in the Airport Overlay District Zone shall be equivalent to achieving an interior noise level of 45 dB (A-weighted) when the structure is exposed to an outdoor noise exposure level of 65 Ldn or higher. b. Noise Attenuation Methods – Noise reduction may be accomplished through design standards and/or construction materials. Noise attenuation design measures and materials are referenced in the City Standard Building Code of the City of Fairhope, as amended. In all cases, construction shall conform with the general requirements of the City Standard Building Code of the City of Fairhope as amended. c. Noise Attenuation in Noise Sensitive Commercial Structures – Only those portions of commercial structures associated with noise sensitive activities must incorporate noise level reduction measures sufficient to achieve an interior noise level of 45 dB (A-weighted) when the structure is exposed to an outdoor noise exposure level of 65 Ldn or higher. d. Architect or Engineer Review – An architect or engineer shall review the plans to determine if the building design complies substantially with the intent of the ordinance. e. Aviation Easement – The owner applying for approval to construct a noise sensitive structure or residential subdivision within the area under the Runway Approach Surfaces located within the Airport Noise Overlay District shall agree to grant to the Fairhope Airport Authority, without compensation, an aviation easement for the passage of aircraft and the right to cause in all airspace above the surface of the Grantor’s property noise and other effects that may be caused by aircraft operating at the Fairhope Municipal Airport. Article V Section E.  Special Districts AO – Airport Overlay FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 54  5. Use Restriction – Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Ordinance, no use shall be made of structures, land, or water within the Airport Overlay District Zone to: a. create physical or electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft; b. make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, or result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport; c. create bird strike hazards; or d. otherwise endanger or interfere in any way with the landing, take off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 6. Nonconforming uses a. Regulations Not Retroactive: The Airport Overlay shall not require the removal, soundproofing, or other change or alteration of any noise sensitive structure not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or otherwise interfere with continuance of a nonconforming use. b. Building Additions: A non-conforming noise sensitive structure existing at the time this Ordinance is enacted may be extended or enlarged, provided the extension or enlargement to the structure meets the requirements of this Ordinance. c. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed: Whenever the Director of Planning and Building determines that a nonconforming noise sensitive structure has been abandoned, or more than 50 percent destroyed, physically deteriorated, or decayed (based on assessed value), the rebuilding or repair of the structure shall comply with the requirements of this Ordinance. 7. Permits a. Building Permit Required: No noise sensitive structure shall be constructed in the Airport Overlay District unless a permit has been applied for and granted by the Planning and Building Department. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to determine whether the resulting structure would conform to these regulations. b. Variances: An application for a variance in the Airport overlay shall first be submitted to the Airport Authority. If the Airport Authority does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the applicant may file an appeal with Board of Adjustments and Appeals. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny the application c. Permit Application Requirements: An application for a permit shall be accompanied by a plat or plan showing the location of the lot to be built upon and the location of the proposed structure; a certification from a registered architect, engineer, or acoustician that the plans for the structure include noise attenuation measures adequate to meet the requirements of this Ordinance; together with such other information as the Planning and Building Department may deem necessary to enforce properly the provisions of this Ordinance. F. P-1 – Parking District  1. Intent – The Parking District designates one or more lots, parcels, tracts, or sites to be used exclusively for the parking of vehicles, either outdoors or indoors.

Site Design Standards – General site design standards contained in Article IV. apply to the VRM district in addition to the following specific site design standards. a Open space: Refer to Article IV., Section A. for general open space design standards. The following additional open space standards apply in the VRM district: (1) At least 80% of the dwellings should be within one mile of three different types of open space. (2) At least 80% of the residential units should be within one mile from each category (natural and civic) of open space (3) At least 80% of the residential units should be within 1980 feet of 1 or more types of open space. (4) Off-site open space may count towards the requirements of this section if it is publicly accessible. (5) Accessory dwelling units shall not count towards the dwelling unit percentage recommendations of this section. (6) Distance shall be measured along public right-of-way or public trail or greenway. b. Streetscape: Refer to Article IV., Section C. for general streetscape design standards. The following additional streetscape standards apply in the VRM district: (1) The average building line on opposite sides of the street shall not differ by more than 20 feet. (2) The building line on an individual lot shall not differ by more than five feet from the building line of adjacent lots. See Figure 6-1. (3) The building line on an individual lot shall not differ by more than five feet from the average building line on the same side of a single block. (4) No more than two frontage types may be used on the same side of a single block. See Figure 6-1. (5) The preferred height to width ratio for the streetscape (height of buildings: distance between facades on opposite sides of street) should be between 1:2 and 1:4, except in the case of single- family dwellings on arterial streets where a larger setback may create an appropriate transition for single-family Commentary  See Article IV., Section C. for a description, intent and goals of the streetscape. A defined streetscape is created by a ratio of height to width formed by buildings on opposite sides of the street. The width includes the width of the right-of-way and the depth of any private setback to the building façade. The height equals the average height of buildings along a block, or the height of the primary façade to any substantially recessed areas. See Figure 6-3 for diagrams relating to the streetscape and the proper ratio of height to width. Figure 6-1. This figure illustrates two different frontage types – a terrace and a yard – while still maintaining consistent setbacks (no greater deviation than 5 feet) on adjacent lots. Article VI Section A  Village Districts VRM Village Residential Mix FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 67  dwelling units on higher-order streets. See Figure 6-2 (6) This section shall not apply to estate dwelling units or civic uses. c. Site Access: Refer to Article IV., Section D. for general site access standards. The following additional site access standards apply in the VRM district: (1) Curb cuts on local streets shall be separated by a minimum of 60 feet. (2) Shared access driveways or rear access lanes shall be used on blocks with residential lots less than 60 feet wide. Shared access driveways require an easement to each lot owner indicated on the plat and recorded or granted by a separate deed instrument. See Figure 6-3.  d. Parking: Refer to Article IV., Section E. for general parking standards. The following additional parking standards apply in the VRM district: (1) The maximum size of an off-street parking area for any use in the NVM district is 40 spaces. (2) All off-street parking in the NVM district shall be on the same lot as the use the parking serves, or on dedicated common area for a group of lots. Any parking on common areas shall be within 100 feet of the structure it is to serve (3) On-street parking may be used towards required parking according to Article IV., Section E. (4) All off-street parking areas shall be located behind buildings, except for estate dwelling units and single-family detached dwelling units. (5) All off-street parking shall be screened from adjacent lots according to Article IV., Section E. Figure 6-2. This figure illustrates the ideal ratio of building heights that frame the streetscape to the total width of the streetscape area. Streetscapes closer to the 2:1 end of this range should be used as transitions near village centers. Figure 6-3. Rear access lanes or shared driveways shall be used on all lots less than 60 feet wide. Commentary  Vehicular access on individual lots interrupts the pedestrian area of the streetscape. This conflict is exaggerated when accessing smaller compact lots. Therefore alternative vehicular access must be used when lots are narrow. Rear access lanes Shared driveways  Article VI Section A  Village Districts VRM Village Residential Mix FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 68  e. Building Design: The following building design standards apply in the VRM district: (1) All structures shall have a primary entrance that faces the street.

(b) Front entry garages shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the front building line containing the primary entrance. See Figure 6-4. (c) The portion of the facade used for front-entry garages shall be less than 50% of the reaming portion of the front facade producing at least a 2:1 ratio of living space to garage space on front facades. (d) Any front entry garage door shall be for a single vehicle. Multiple car front-entry garages shall require multiple single-entry doors. See Figure 6-5  f. Design Guidelines: The following design elements are recommended in the VRM district: (1) Roofs - Pitched roofs are preferred. Buildings with a flat roof should incorporate a parapet or decorative cornice line. (2) Scale – Buildings should not exceed a height to width ratio of 1 to 2 without a variation in the building mass to break up the scale. Variations in building mass could include a setback in the facade between 18 inches and 3 feet. Any such variation should occur over at least 25% of the entire facade. See Figure 6-6. (3) Architectural Style – the architectural style and materials should be compatible on all sides of a building. (4) Entrances - All primary entrances should be articulated by any of the following design elements: (a) A single story porch at least eight feet deep and covering at least 50% of the facade; (b) A single story portico at least six feet deep and at least eight feet wide. (c) A stoop entry if a stoop frontage is used. (5) Openings – Window and door openings should be vertically oriented, however windows and doors should be grouped to have a similar orientation as the structure. All front facades should have between 15% and 30% of the façade occupied by windows or doors. See Figure 6-7 (6) Diversity - Buildings should present diverse but consistent appearances. Consistency will be determined by the scale and mass of structures and diversity will be determined by variation of facade planes, roof lines, materials and colors used for external walls and trim. All materials should be consistent with the overall character of the neighborhood. Figure 6-5. Only single entry doors are allowed if the garage is front loaded and facing the street. Figure 6-7. All openings should be vertically oriented to reflect a pedestrian scale but may be grouped to form larger horizontal masses. Window and door openings provide contrast to the main wall and should occupy between 15% to 30% of the facade. Figure 6-6. Building facades that exceed a 2:1 width to height ratio must contain variations in wall planes. Figure 6-4. Any front entry garage doors shall be set back at least 20 feet from the front building line where the primary entry of the house is located.

Article VII Section A  Non-conformities Purpose and Intent  FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 81     Article VII Non-conformities  A. Purpose and Intent B. Non-conforming Structures C. Non-conforming Uses D. Non-conforming Lots E. Maintenance of Non-conformities F. Adjacent Land     A. Purpose and Intent  This ordinance seeks to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights. The elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that are not in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance. Lawful non- conformities can adversely affect orderly development, maintenance, and use and taxable values throughout the City. To avoid undue hardship, non-conformities that came into existence lawfully should be allowed to exist subject to conditions in this Article; however, the conditions should seek to ultimately secure compliance with the comprehensive plan. B. Non-conforming Structures  Structures that were legally constructed prior to the adoption of this ordinance, but which could not be constructed under the terms of this ordinance are considered legal non-conforming structures. A legal non-conforming structure may continue to exist subject to the following:  1. Non-conforming structures, or those parts of a structure that are non-conforming may not be expanded either horizontally, or vertically. Alteration and expansions shall conform to all current regulations. 2. The structure shall remain legal in all other regards except for the non-conformance that existed upon adoption of the ordinance that made the structure non-conforming. 3. A non-conforming structure, which is not intentionally damaged, destroyed, or removed, may be restored within one year from the date of the event. If the structure is not re-constructed in one year  Article VII Section B  Non-conformities Non-conforming Structures  FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 82  all restorations and improvements shall be in compliance with applicable ordinances. The burden of proof of date of damage or destruction shall be on the person proposing the restoration. C. Non-conforming Uses  Use of land or structure that legally existed prior to the adoption of this ordinance, but which could not be initiated under the terms of this ordinance is considered a legal non-conforming use. A legal non-conforming use of land or structures may continue to exist subject to the following:  1. The use shall be restricted to the lot and building occupied by the use as of the effective date of the ordinance creating the non-conformance. A legal non-conforming use shall not be extended to any other building or lot or part of a lot. 2. A lawful non-conforming use that ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days shall not be reinitiated unless it is in compliance with all ordinances. If a legal non-conforming use is replaced by a conforming use, the legal non-conforming use shall not be reinitiated. 3. Any site characteristic of a use, whether conforming to this ordinance or a legal non-conforming use, in existence prior to adoption of this ordinance (such as parking, landscaping, or driveways) shall be considered legal. However, any change in use, expansion of the use, or expansion of the structure associated with the use shall require all non-conforming site characteristics to be brought in conformance with this ordinance. 4. A change of a legal non-conforming use shall only be allowed if the change is to a conforming use or to a use that is considered less non-conforming, as determined by the Director of Planning and Building, either in extent of non-conformance or in intensity. D. Non-conforming Lots  Where a lot, tract or parcel of land has an area or width that does not conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located, the lot may be used for a detached single-family dwelling except in the M-1 and M-2 Industrial Districts. A single detached family dwelling may be constructed in an R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, or R-5 Residential District provided the lot to be so used has a minimum area of four thousand (4,000) square feet and a minimum lot width at the building line of forty (40) feet, provided it is located on a public sewer. Yard requirements shall be modified subject to the following conditions: 1. On double frontage lots (interior lots abutting two (2) streets) the required front yard shall be provided on each street. 2. The side yard requirements for substandard lots of record may be reduced for each side yard at the rate of one (1) foot for each four (4) feet by which the lot width lacks fifty (50) feet, provided in no event shall such side yard be reduced to less than five (5) feet on each side. 3. The minimum front setback required for the district (and, on corner lots, the street side setback) shall not apply to any lot where the average front building line(s) of the adjacent lot(s), is less than the minimum setback required for the district. In such cases, the front building line may be the same as the average front building lines(s) of the adjacent lot(s). In no case, shall the front building line be more than 5’ less than the minimum setback required for the district. 4. On corner lots, the street side yard shall be that part of the lot having its greatest frontage abutting that right-of- way and the required setback shall be 20 feet, unless otherwise provided herein. E. Maintenance of Non-conformities  In the interest of public safety and health, routine maintenance of non-conforming situations shall continue as warranted by the property owner or otherwise required by law, provided that no maintenance involves continuance or expansion of the non-conformity contrary to this Article. Article VII Section F.  Non-conformities Adjacent Land  FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 83   F. Adjacent Land  The presence of a non-conforming use in a zoning district shall not be allowable as grounds for the granting of variances for other surrounding properties by the board of adjustment. Article VIII Section A  Enforcement Penalties FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 84       Article VIII Enforcement  A. Penalties B. Remedies C. Appeal    A. Penalties  Any person violating any provision of this ordinance shall be fined upon conviction, not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and court costs for each offense. Violation of any provision of this ordinance may also be punished by issuance of municipal offense ticket as provided by Ordinance No. 862. B. Remedies  In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or converted, in violation of this ordinance, the building inspector, legal officer, or other appropriate authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specially damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use; or to correct or abate such violation; or to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure, or land. Each and every day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use continues shall be deemed a separate offense. C. Appeal  If, after notification of a zoning violation the individual or corporation elects to apply for a zoning variance, the applicant must complete all notification requirements of the variance application process within ten (10) business days of notification of the violation. Written notification of the proposed variance shall be postmarked to the required surrounding property owners within ten (10) business days and in addition, such other public notification as required shall have been provided by the applicant. Should the applicant be unable to comply with this provision he shall provide a written explanation through the building inspector to the board of adjustment. Failure to do either shall be interpreted as a withdrawal of the appeal and shall subject the applicant to immediate compliance with this ordinance.

Lisa Lisa Lisa  Ordinance No. 1138 10 December 2001 Page ~7- ARTICLE 10. PERMITS 1. Future Uses - Except as specifically provided in a, b, and c hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any prescribed zone hereby created unless a permit has been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Article 10, Section 4, of this Ordinance. a. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. b. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 5,000 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall required for any tee or structure less than fifty feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height prescribed for such approach zones. c. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structures, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this Ordinance except as set forth in Article 7, Section 6. 2. Existing Uses - No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. Lisa Lisa Lisa Lisa Lisa  Ordinance No. 1138 10 December 2001 Page —8- 3. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed - Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 50 percent destroyed, physically deteriorated, or decayed (based on assessed value), no permit shall be granted that would allow such tree or structure to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. Variances - Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in the Ordinance, may apply to the Board of Adjustments and Appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of the Ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this Ordinance may be considered by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals unless a copy of the application and FAA determination has been furnished to the Airport Board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Board does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of Adjustments and Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application. Obstruction Marking and Lighting - Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of the Ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Airport Authority of the City of Fairhope, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights. Permit Application Requirements - An application for a permit shall be accompanied by a plat or plan showing the exact location of the lot to be built upon and the elevation, height, and location of the proposed building, structure, or use to be placed thereon, together with such other information as the zoning compliance officer may deem necessary to enforce properly the provisions of this Ordinance.

ENFORCEMENT It shall be in the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Zoning Administrator upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by this Ordinance to be submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for action by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning Administrator. ARTICLE 12. BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS AND APPEALS 1. Powers - Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall have and exercise the following powers: a. To authorize in specific cases such as variance from the terms of the Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. The Board shall not grant a variance to the terms of this Ordinance if the hardship is self-imposed by the applicant. b. To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this Ordinance upon which the Board of Adjustments and Appeals may be required to pass under these regulations. C.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FAIRHOPE, ALABAMA, WHILE IN REGULAR SESSION AT THE FAIRHOPE CITY HALL ON DECEMBER 20, 2001, as follows:  ARTICLE I AUTHORITY AND ENACTMENT CLAUSE The City Council of the City of Fairhope, Alabama, in pursuance of the authority granted by Titles 4, Chapter 6, Section 1 through 15, Code of Alabama, 1975, hereby ordains and enacts into law the following sections. ARTICLE 2 SHORT TITLE This Ordinance shall be known as and may be cited as “The Airport Overlay District Zoning Ordinance of the City of Fairhope, Alabama.” ARTICLE 3 FINDINGS It is hereby found that certain land uses are incompatible with noise generated by aircraft using the Fairhope Municipal Airport and that these land uses have the potential to impair the existing and future utility of the Fairhope Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared: 1. That the establishment and construction of noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential of limiting the existing and future utility of the airport and may adversely affect the region served by the Fairhope Municipal Airport; 2. That noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential to become land uses incompatible with airport operations over time and it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of incompatible land uses be prevented. 3. The prevention of the creation or establishment of incompatible land uses, and the elimination, removal, alteration, and mitigation are public purposes. 4. That land in the vicinity of the airport has the potential of being exposed to sound levels of 65 Ldn and higher. 5. That the construction of certain noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport should include outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation features so as not to be incompatible with existing and future noise levels. 6. That the Fairhope Municipal Airport fulfills an essential community purpose. Lisa Lisa Lisa  Ordinance No. 1140 Page —2- ARTICLE 4 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 1. Purpose The purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by preventing the creation and establishment of land uses incompatible with the operations of the Fairhope Municipal Airport and requiring the incorporation of outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation measures for the construction of certain structures within the boundary of the Airport Overlay District Zone. For decades, residential housing has been constructed near airports, often without consideration of the current and future airport noise impacts to homeowners. As a result, millions of federal, state, and local dollars have been used to pay for noise mitigation programs in the United States. It has been determined that current airport noise impacts to residents in the vicinity of the Fairhope Municipal Airport are minimal. However, the potential for future conflict seems certain given that the area's residential growth and continued plans to promote development in the vicinity of the airport. The purpose of this plan is to promote the implementation of modest measures that will prevent conflicts between future residential homeowners and the airport that could require expensive retroactive noise insulation programs, residential relocation programs, and restrictions on the efficient operation of the Fairhope Municipal! Airport. 2. Applicability The regulations set forth herein are applicable to all lands lying within the Airport Overlay District Zone which is delineated on the Fairhope Municipal Airport Overlay Zoning Map adopted as part of the Airport Overlay District Zoning Ordinance of the City of Fairhope, Alabama.

Insert a new subsection 3 that reads: a. Compact Car Parking Requirement: Compact car parking spaces shall be a minimum of 30% of the required parking spaces and no more than a maximum of 40% of the required parking spaces. Compact car spaces shall be grouped together to the greatest extent possible. Compact car spaces shall be designated by paint at the entrance of the parking stall. 2. Insert a new subsection 4 that reads: a. Parking Dimension and Size: I) Standard parking lot dimensions 2) Compact car parking dimensions width depth 8' 15 ' 8' 16.8' 3. The existing subsection 4 is re-numbered to section 5 4. Insert a new subsection 6 that reads: 8' 16.5' a. Low Impact Development (LID) Parking Requirements Landscaping is required for all parking lots. The interior parking lot landscaping requirements shall use LID techniques and be designed by an Alabama licensed Professional Engineer and an Alabama licensed Landscape Architect or designer. The following LID techniques shall be used in the interior of all parking lots containing 12 or more parking spaces. The LID parking requirement landscape plan will be reviewed in accordance with the Tree Ordinance. Any landscaping plan submitted in accordance with this subsection shall include technique 5 below and at least one of the other following techniques:  Ordinance No. 1550 Page -2- I) First Flush Treatment: The LID landscaping design shall be sized appropriately to treat the first one inch of runoff into the receiving parking lot LID area. 2) Bio-retention. 3) Rain Garden. 4) Vegetated Swale. 5) Permeable Pavement Systems: Permeable pavement systems are a required LID technique. I 00% of parking provided over and above the minimum parking requirements shall be permeable pavement systems. Typical systems are brick pavers, pervious asphalt, and pervious concrete. Other systems may be approved if the design engineer provides adequate documentation that demonstrates the proposed technique is equally or more effective that the typical permeable systems listed. Approval of a proposed technique is at the sole discretion of the City during the permitting process. 6) Tree and Ground Cover Plantings: When trees are required in a parking lot by the Tree Ordinance they shall be included and integrated into the LID design. Species shall be as approved by the City Horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape architect or designer. There shall be no bare ground exposed and all ground cover proposed shall be integral to the success of LID techniques. All ground cover shall be as approved by the City Horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape architect or designer. 5. That Article lX Definitions and Interpretation Section C. defined terms are amended to add the following: a. Bioretention: This technique removes pollutants in stormwater runoff through adsorption, filtration , sedimentation, volatilization, ion exchange, and biological decomposition. A Bioretention Cell (BRC) is a depression in the landscape that captures and stores runoff for a short time, while providing habitat for native vegetation that is both flood and drought tolerant. BRCs are stormwater control measures (SCMs) that are similar to the homeowner practice, of installing rain gardens, with the exception that BRCs have an underlying specialized soil media and are designed to meet a desired stormwater quantity treatment storage volume. Peak runoff rates and runoff volumes can be reduced and groundwater can be recharged when bioretention is located in an area with the appropriate soil conditions to provide infiltration. Bioretention is normally designed for the water quality or ""first flush"" event, typically the first I"" -1.5"" of rainfall, to treat stormwater pollutants. b. Vegetated Swale: is a shallow, open-channel stabilized with grass or other herbaceous vegetation designed to filter pollutants and convey stormwater. Swales are applicable along roadsides, in parking lots, residential subdivisions, commercial developments, and are well suited to single-family residential and campus type developments. Water quality swales are designed to meet sheer stress targets for the design storm, may be characterized as wet or dry swales, may contain amended soils to infiltrate stormwater runoff, and are generally planted with turf grass or other herbaceous vegetation. c. First Flush : This is the given volume of water generated in the drainage area from the first I"" to 1.5'' of rainfall. Ordinance No. 1550 Page- 3- d. Rain Garden: a shallow depression in a landscape that captures water and holds it for a short period of time to allow for infiltration, filtration of pollutants, habitat for native plants, and effective storm water treatment for small-scale residential or commercial drainage areas. Rain gardens use native plants, mulch, and soi l to clean up runoff. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE- if any part, section or subdivision ofthis ordinance shall be held unconstitutional or invalid for any reason, such holding shall not be construed to invalidate or impair the remainder of this ordinance, which shall continue in full force and effect not withstanding such holding.

(a) Lawful nonconforming uses, structures, lots, and signs are declared by this Development Code to be incompatible with land uses, structures, lots, and signs that conform to the requirements of the zoning districts in which the nonconformity exists. However, such nonconforming develop- ment may continue under the circumstances presented in this Code Section for each type of non- conformity. (b) For the purpose of this Section 106, “value” shall be computed from the amount a building or structure, as applicable, is appraised for tax purposes by the City of Duluth. 106.03 Continuation of Illegal Nonconformity Prohibited.

(b) Continuance of Nonconforming Uses. The lawful nonconforming use of any building structure or tract of land existing at the time of the adoption of this Development Code or any subsequent amendment may be continued even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this Development Code except that the non-conforming use shall not be:  (1) Extended in any way, either on the same or adjoining property. Section 106 Nonconformities. City of Duluth UDC 1-8 (2) Extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure. (3) Re-established after discontinuance for three months regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier to resume the nonconforming use.

(b) Continuance of Nonconforming Structures. (1) A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or extended unless a variance for such has been granted by the Duluth Zoning Board of Appeals. A legal nonconforming structure may be maintained or repaired, under permit, in accordance with all pertinent building codes and ordinances. (2) Structures that are nonconforming for reasons of design standards, landscaping require- ments, or buffer standards may be occupied by another tenant, regardless of use, without having to bring the structure/building into compliance with the current standards provided the “footprint” or the height of the structure/building is not increased. (3) Change of ownership, tenancy, or management of a nonconforming structure shall not affect its legal, nonconforming status. (4) Whenever a nonconforming structure is damaged by any means and the extent of the dam- age is 50% or less of the floor area of the structure or 50% or less of the replacement value of the structure, as determined by the Building Official, the structure may be restored, pro- vided it is replaced within six months. (5) Whenever a nonconforming structure is damaged by any means and the extent of the dam- age is more than 50% of the floor area of the structure or 50% or more of the replacement value of the structure, as determined by the City Building Official, the structure shall not be restored unless in conformity with all applicable ordinances. 106.06 Nonconforming Lots. (a) Nonconforming Lot; Defined. A lawful nonconforming lot is a lot of record whose area, frontage, width, or other dimensions, or location were lawful prior to the adoption or amendment of this Development Code, and which, by reason of such adoption or amendment, no longer meets or exceeds one or more such require- ments of the applicable zoning district. (b) Treatment of Nonconforming Lots. (1) A lawful nonconforming lot of record located in a residential district may be used for a single- family dwelling without the need for a variance from the Duluth Zoning Board of Appeals provided that all yard requirements are met.

(2) When two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of this Development Code and such lots, indi- vidually, have an area or width that is less than is required by this Development Code, then such contiguous lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of the minimum width and area required in the zoning district in which they are located. (3) For a lawful nonconforming lot of record, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width single-family dwelling, the Planning and Development Director is hereby authorized to grant a special exception reducing the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling but, in no case shall each of the side yards be less than 5 feet in width.

Section 207 Uses Allowed in Each Zoning District. City of Duluth UDC 2-26 Section 207. Uses Allowed in Each Zoning District. This Section identifies the uses that are allowed by right or by Special Use approval in each of the zoning districts, and uses to which certain restrictions apply. (a) In specific areas covered by an overlay district, the overlay district imposes restrictions on uses not noted on the following use tables. The specifics of each overlay district under this Article must be consulted as applicable to a particular property or area. (b) In Planned Unit Developments (PUDs), uses that are allowed are established through approval of the planned development. See the Subdivisions and Planned Developments Article of this Devel- opment Code for details. 207.02 Chart of Uses. This Section lists by the following matrix chart (Table 2-C: Principal Uses Allowed by Zoning District) the uses allowed by right and by Special Use approval in each zoning district. A listed allowed use is one that is allowed in the zone without any qualifications, except wherever such qualifications may be indicated in this Development Code. A listed special use is one that may be granted only when certain conditions are met. In the following chart an “A” means that the use is automatically allowed in the zoning district listed by the abbreviation at the top of the column. An “S” means that the use is allowed only by special use approval. A blank space indicates that the use is not allowed under any circum- stances. 207.03 Allowed Principal, Accessory and Temporary Uses. (a) A Principal Use is the specific, primary purpose for which land or a building is used. (b) An Accessory Use is a use that is permitted on a property in conjunction with a principal use. An accessory use is incidental to the principal use and would not exist independent of the principal use. (c) A Temporary Use is a use having a specific duration or the end of which is related to a specific action, usually lasting for only a few days or months at a time. (d) Principal uses that are allowed by right or allowed only by Special Use approval in each zoning district are shown on the following Table 2-C. Accessory uses and temporary uses that are allowed in conjunction with a principal use are shown on Table 2-D. 207.04 Special Uses. Principal and accessory uses that are Special Uses may be granted subject to Special Use approval procedures as set forth in the Procedures and Permits Article of this Code. 207.05 Restrictions on Particular Uses. Restrictions that apply to certain principal uses and to certain zoning districts are referenced on Table 2-C and on Table 2-D, and are contained in Article 3. The restrictions also apply to Special Uses unless specifically waived or modified as a stipulation of Special Use approval. For those uses that have spe- cific restrictions associated with them, a reference is given on the two tables to the pertinent Section in Article 3. The provisions of Division I of Article 3 that apply to development in general, however, are not indicated in either of the two tables. 207.06 Prohibited Uses. (a) Any principal use not shown on the following on Table 2-C as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a Special Use, is specifically prohibited. City of Duluth UDC                             Section 207 Uses Allowed in Each Zoning District. 2-27 (b) Any accessory use not shown on the following Table 2-B as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a Special Use, is specifically prohibited. 207.07 Interpretation of Uses. Some degree of interpretation will occasionally be required. It is not possible to list each and every variation or name of a given use. (a) In addition to other generally accepted references and resources, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (2012 edition), may be referred to in order to interpret the definition of uses listed on Table 2-C and Table 2-D and to identify similar uses that may be allowed along with each listed use. The NAICS classification num- ber is shown on the tables for each applicable use for reference and interpretation only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this Code. (b) The NAICS assigns classification numbers to businesses and industries based on the primary busi- ness activity in which the company is engaged. While business activity usually corresponds to land use type, and therefore can be easily assigned to appropriate zoning districts, there are excep- tions. Some businesses may be primarily engaged in a certain industry—such as telecommunica- tions, for instance, like AT&T—but individual locations host notably different activities. For a com- pany like AT&T, for instance, different facilities may include retail stores for telephones, offices for administrative functions, satellite and exchange switching stations, and repair and installation staging lots where heavy equipment vehicles, telephone poles, wire spools and materials are stored. As a result, interpretation is occasionally needed for an individual use, regardless of the business activity in which the parent company is engaged. (1) If no NAICS classification number is shown on the table, there is no corresponding category to the land use listed. The use may be residential in nature (there are no NAICS categories for residences) or may be a land use activity not generally recognized as a business activity or industry type. (2) In all cases of uncertainty, the determination of whether or not a particular use is allowed in a particular zoning district shall reflect the purpose of the zoning district as stated in this Article, both the common and dictionary definitions of the use, and the array of listed uses that are allowed in the district as to their character and intensity. Table 2-C and Table 2-D are organized under the following land use categories: Table 2-C organizes the various principal uses under the following headings:  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing  Residential Uses  Administrative and Professional Offices  Commercial Services  Arts, Entertainment and Recreation  Retail Trade  Manufacturing, Wholesaling and Warehousing  Transportation, Communications and Utilities  Public and Institutional Uses Table 2-D presents the various accessory uses and temporary uses allowed in each zoning district.

This Code Section is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Duluth, tele- communications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of wireless facilities and support structures within the City of Duluth so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Duluth as a proactive city in the availability of wireless telecommunications service. 343.02 Purposes. (a) Provide for the appropriate location and development of wireless facilities and support structures to serve the residents and businesses of the City of Duluth (b) Protect the City of Duluth’s built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for wireless facilities and support structures. (c) Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless facilities and support structures through care- ful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques. Section 343 Wireless Telecommunications. City of Duluth UDC  3-28 (d) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from wireless facility and support structure failure through engineering and careful siting of wireless facilities and support structures. (e) Maximize use of any new and existing wireless support structures (towers) so as to mini- mize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers through- out the City. (f) Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a pri- mary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers. (g) Encourage and promote the location of new wireless facilities and support structures in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 343.03 Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from this Code Section: (a) Any wireless facilities and support structures under 70 feet in total height and owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commis- sion. (b) Any wireless facilities or support structures located on property owned, leased or other- wise controlled by the City of Duluth, provided a license or lease authorizing a wireless telecommunications facility has been approved by the governing body. (c) Any wireless facilities and support structures for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this Code (and is current and not expired), with the exception that any modifications or collocation proposed after issuance of the initial permit shall be reviewed and processed in accordance with this Code Section. 343.04 Collocation; Availability of Suitable Existing Structures. No new wireless support structure (tower) shall be allowed unless the appli- cant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning and Development De- partment and the City Council that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure (clock towers, bell towers, church steeples, light/power poles, electric transmission towers, manmade trees, and similar natural or manmade alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the pres- ence of antennas or towers) can accommodate the applicant's proposed wire- less facilities. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the pro- posed antenna shall consist of the following: (a) That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antennas placement area re- quired to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. (b) That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. Illustrative example of multiple wireless facilities on a single tower (co-location). City of Duluth UDC Section 343 Wireless Telecommunications. 3-29 (c) That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment. (d) That the applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. (e) That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. (f) That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that ren- der existing towers and structures unsuitable. 343.05 Allowed Zoning Districts. (a) If it is adequately demonstrated that antenna collocation, as required in Sec. 343.03(c), is not possible for a given geographic antenna placement area, constructing a new tower, including placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connec- tion with said tower or antenna, may be allowed in the following zoning districts upon Special Use approval by City Council: M-1, M-2, C-1, C-2, HC-Retail, HC-Auto, PUD, O-I and RA-200. (b) Collocation, as described in Section Sec. 343.03(c), shall be allowed in the following zoning districts: M-1, M-2, C-1, C-2, HC-Retail, HC-Auto, PUD, O-I and RA-200. 343.06 Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses.

Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower. (b) Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. (c) Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided requirement Sec. 343.07(h)(5) is met along with all setback, design and landscape requirements as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 343.07 General Requirements. The requirements set forth in this Code Section shall govern the location and construction of all wire- less facilities and support structures governed by this Code. (a) Building Codes and Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of wireless facilities and support structures, the owner of such a facility and structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such wireless facilities and support structures are published by the FCC as amended from time to time. The owner shall also conduct periodic inspec- Section 343 Wireless Telecommunications. City of Duluth UDC  3-30 tions of such facilities at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspec- tions shall be conducted by a Georgia licensed structural engineer. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the Planning and Development Director. (b) Regulatory Compliance. All wireless facilities and support structures must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate wireless facilities and structures. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the facilities and structures gov- erned by this Code Section shall bring such communications facilities and structures into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. (c) Security. All wireless support structures shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fenc- ing not less than 6 feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. This requirement may be waived by the Planning and Development Director it is deemed that this would produce negative visual clutter or obstruct a view corridor. (d) Lighting. No illumination is permitted on wireless facilities or support structures unless part of an approved public lighting program or required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the Planning and Development Director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. (e) Advertising. No advertising is permitted on wireless facilities or support structures. (f) Visual Impact. (1) Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical (i.e. camouflaging through integration with structures or appearance such as artifi- cial trees, etc.). (2) Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing to- pography shall be minimized, unless such dis- turbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. (3) At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment (i.e. artificial tree appearance, steeples, decorative fencing, etc.). (4) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to re- duce visual obtrusiveness. Illustrative example of wireless tower camouflaged as a tree  City of Duluth UDC Section 343 Wireless Telecommunications. 3-31 (5) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower and is generally visible to the public, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air con- ditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. (6) Antennas mounted on architecturally significant structures or significant architectural details of the building shall be covered by appropriate casings that are manufactured to match ex- isting architectural features found on the building. (7) Where feasible, antennas can be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. (8) Towers or roof mounted antennas shall not be placed in direct line with significant view cor- ridors, as designated by the City of Duluth or by any state or federal law or agency. For purposes of this Code Section a significant view corridor shall be defined as an area to be kept free of obstructions or structures that interfere with the view of any scenic area, historic building or area. A view corridor shall be established by ordinance of the City of Duluth by zoning restrictions adopted in accordance with the ordinances of the City of Duluth, or by any state or federal law or agency in accordance with provisions of federal laws or duly adopted regulations. (9) Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment com- pounds shall be screened from public view and may use landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding structures. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly main- tained. (g) Landscaping. (1) Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the equipment compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. (2) Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The appli- cant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and veg- etation to be replanted. (3) The Planning and Development Director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the land- scaping requirement may be modified or waived by the Planning and Development Director. (h) Lot Size and Setbacks. The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: (1) Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in Section 343.07(g). Section 343 Wireless Telecommunications. City of Duluth UDC  3-32 (2) Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property. (3) Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the required engineer’s analysis. (4) When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height. (5) Towers greater than 70 feet in height shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable as determined by the City Council through a Special Use approval request. (6) Setbacks for towers 70 feet and less shall not be closer to a residential structure than the height of the tower or closer to a residential property line than 40 feet. 343.08 Special Use Approval. (a) Special use approval shall be required to: (1) Construct a new tower in an allowed district identified in Sec. 343.05; or (2) Modify or accept a collocation to a previously approved wireless facility or support structure (tower) when the proposed modification of collocation: a. Increases the overall height or width of the support structure to which the wireless fa- cilities are to be attached; or b. Increases the dimensions of the equipment compound that was initially approved by the City. (b) Application. In addition to the special use review and approval requirements found in the Procedures and Permits Article of this Development Code, the following process shall ap- ply: (1) An application shall be submitted that includes the following information: a.

When used with parallel parking or where there is no parking, shall be at least 10 feet wide for one-way traffic and at least 20 feet wide for two-way traffic. A minimum 10-foot driveway and stacking lane is required for any type drive-up window (this is in addition to regular driveways). Section 403 Plan and Design Standards for Off-Street Parking. City of Duluth UDC 4-2 403.03 Surfacing, Drainage, and Maintenance. (a) All permanent required off-street parking and vehicle sales space shall be properly drained and surfaced. A proper surface shall consist of concrete, asphalt, or similar smooth material. (b) Off-street parking areas shall be maintained in proper repair, free of potholes, pavement separa- tion or other surface or curbing deterioration, indistinguishable striping or directional arrows where required, and missing but required signage and indistinguishable handicapped space des- ignations. 403.04 Lighting of Parking Areas. See the Outdoor Lighting Section in the Restrictions on Particular Uses Article of this Development Code. 403.05 Stacking Spaces for Drive-Through Facilities. (a) Stacking spaces shall be provided for any use having a drive-through facility or areas having drop- off and pickup areas, including the following uses: (1) Financial institutions with drive-through windows; (2) Restaurants with drive-through facilities; (3) Carwashes (automated or staffed facilities); (4) Drive-through coffee sales facilities; and (5) Any other uses with drive-through facilities.

Illustrative example of drive-through lanes that are separated from parking areas and have an adjacent bypass lane. City of Duluth UDC Section 403 Plan and Design Standards for Off-Street Parking. 4-3 If the required automobile off-street parking spaces cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot on which the principal use is located, such spaces may be provided on other off-street property lying not more than 400 feet from the main entrance to the principal use. In this situation, the applicant shall submit with his application for a building permit or a certificate of occupancy an instrument duly executed and acknowledged, that accepts as a condition for the issuance of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy the permanent availability of such off-street parking spaces to serve the prin- cipal use. 403.07 Shared Parking. The parking spaces provided for separate uses may be combined in one parking lot, but the required spaces as- signed to each use may not be assigned to another use, except as follows: (a) Shared Parking Between Day and Night Users. One-half of the off-street parking spaces required by a use whose peak attendance will be at night may be shared with a use that will be closed at night or on Sunday. (b) Mixed Use Developments. Parking spaces may be shared by more than one use if the Planning and Development Director finds that the total number of spaces will be adequate at the peak hours of the uses they serve. The ratios on Table 4-A may be used in determining the time of day and the day of the week at which the maximum number of spaces will be needed by the uses served by the shared parking facility. Table 4-A: Percentage of Required Parking Spaces by Time Period Weekdays Weekends Nighttime Type of Use 6 am to 5  5pm to 1  6 am to 5 pm 5pm to 1  1am to 6 am Office 100% 10% 10% 5% 5% Retail 60% 90% 100% 70% 5% Hotel 75% 100% 75% 100% 75% Restaurant 50% 100% 100% 100% 10% Entertainment/Recreation 40% 100% 80% 100% 10% Religious Facility 10% 25% 100% 100% 10%  By way of example, the following illustrates shared parking calculations for a particular mixed-use development:   Section 403 Plan and Design Standards for Off-Street Parking. City of Duluth UDC 4-4  (c) Availability of Shared Spaces. Parking spaces that are proposed to be shared among two or more uses must be clearly available to each use and not appear in any way to be serving a particular use, either through signage ded- icating the spaces or through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a particular business or building. (d) Recordation of Shared Parking Agreement. Shared parking arrangements must be committed to writing in an instrument acceptable to the Planning and Development Director, and approved by the owners of each of the affected proper- ties or uses. The instrument must be approved by the Planning and Development Director and shall be recorded with the Clerk of the Superior Court, and a copy of the recorded document must be supplied to the Planning and Development Director. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the Duluth City Council. 403.08 Parking Lot Design, Screening, and Location. The requirements of this Section shall apply to all off-street parking lots, including areas dedicated to customer and employee parking and for storing or displaying vehicles (such as a car sales lot). (a) In all zoning districts, there are options for placement and screening of parking lots on the prop- erty. Those options include: (1) Push the building closer to the road and allow no parking between the building and the road with the required 10-foot landscape strip as required in the Buffers, Landscaping and Tree Protection Article of this Development Code. a. The Planning and Development Director has the discretion to reduce the front building setback accordingly to achieve this goal. Example: Spaces needed for uses in a mixed-use project, calculated individually: Factor for Spaces Office 3.5/1,000 100,000 sf 350 Retail 5/1,000 100,000 sf 500 Hotel w/Restaurant 1.5/room 100 rooms 150 Family Restaurant 9.5/1,000 20,000 sf 190 Theater 1/4 seats 200 seats 50 Church 1/4 seats 400 seats 100 TOTAL if figured separately 1,340 Spaces Required applying the Peak Demand Percentages to the Example: Nighttime 6 am--5pm 5pm--1am 6 am--5pm 5pm--1am 1am--6am Office 350 35 35 18 18 Retail 300 450 500 350 25 Hotel w/Restaurant 113 150 113 150 113 Family Restaurant 95 190 190 190 19 Theater 20 50 40 50 5 Church 50 50 100 100 10 TOTAL 928 925 978 858 189 Highest demand = 978 (instead of 1,340) Weekdays Weekends City of Duluth UDC Section 403 Plan and Design Standards for Off-Street Parking. 4-5 b. Changes in topography or other unusual circumstances may be reviewed by the Plan- ning and Development Director, and at his discretion, may modify requirements of this Section, provided the intent of this Article is maintained. (2) Place any portion of the parking between the road and the building with a minimum 3 foot high landscaped berm (maximum 2:1 slope) and a 10 foot landscape strip in accordance with the standards of the Buffers, Landscaping and Tree Protection Article. a. If parking is located below road grade, that vertical footage may be counted toward the required berm height. b. Changes in topography or other unu- sual circumstances may be reviewed by the Planning and Development Di- rector, who, at his discretion, may modify requirements of this Code Section, provided the intent of this Article is maintained. (b) In all areas, pedestrian access via sidewalks shall be provided from the front of the building(s) to the rear parking areas and to the road. Adequate signage directing vehicular traffic to the rear of the building shall also be provided. Parking area(s) shall be lined with large maturing canopy trees a minimum of 15 foot on center, based on species and size at maturity. 403.09 Parking Lot Landscaping. In addition to any landscaping required in the Buffers, Landscaping and Tree Protection Article, there shall be a minimum amount of landscaping within the interior of a parking lot over 10 spaces for a non- residential use shall be designed as follows: (a) Planter islands shall be a minimum of 250 square feet and shall be located at the terminus of each parking row and no further apart than every 10 spaces. (b) All planter islands must be designed with at least 60% coverage in shrubs and no more than 40% coverage in ground cover and landscaping materials. The planter island area shall include at a minimum one shade tree. No plant mate- rials, with the exception of trees, shall exceed 3 feet in height. Turfgrass shall not be permit- ted in the planter islands. (c) Planter islands and landscape strips are usually defined by a barrier curb to prevent vehicular encroachment. Wheel stops or breaks in the barrier curb shall be provided in order to allow for drainage into areas designed to accommo- date the stormwater discharge directed to them. Illustrative example of a landscaped berm used to screen a parking lot. Illustrative example of a continuous planting strip between planter islands and breaks in the curb to allow stormwater to enter. Section 403 Plan and Design Standards for Off-Street Parking. City of Duluth UDC 4-6 (d) Planter islands and strips shall be designed to prevent compaction. This may be accomplished by planting a dense shrub cover or by elevating the planting area a minimum of 1 foot above the curb. (e) Parking lots with more than 100 spaces but less than 375 spaces shall provide planting strips with a minimum width of 5 feet and shall run continuously between all planter islands. These strips shall be planted with 1 tree for every 15 feet of the planter strip, taking into consideration the species and height at maturity. (f) Landscaping shall meet the requirements in the Buffers, Landscaping and Tree Protection Article of this Development Code pertaining to use of native plantings and water-efficient design. 403.10 Standards for Large Parking Lots. Parking lots having a minimum of 375 spaces shall be subdivided into distinct zones of interconnected parking areas that contain no more than 250 parking spaces each. (a) Each zone shall be separated by occupied buildings or by perimeter landscape strips that are at least 10 feet in width and are landscaped as provided in the Buffers, Landscaping and Tree Protection Article. (b) Each parking area shall include sidewalks that are a min- imum of 5 feet wide with prominently marked cross- walks, providing a continuous route to the entrances of adjoining buildings and streets. (c) Bicycle racks equal to one bicycle parking space for each 75 required off-street parking spaces, up to a maximum of 10 bicycle spaces, shall be provided. Bicycle parking areas shall be located in a lighted public area within 200 feet of a principal building entrance. 403.11 Interparcel Access. Interparcel access shall be required as follows: (a) Internal Access Easements Required. For any office or retail sales or services use, the property owner shall grant a “cross” or internal access easement as described in this subsection to each adjoining property that is zoned or used for an office or retail sales or services use. The purpose of the easement is to facilitate movement of cus- tomers from business to business without generating additional turning movements on the public street, thus increasing public safety. Illustrative example of continuous sidewalks and landscape strips in large parking lots. Business A  Business B  Illustrative Example of Interparcel Access  City of Duluth UDC Section 404 Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces Required. 4-7 (b) Access Easement Provisions. The internal access easement shall permit automobile access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for employee, customer, or visitor use on each property; but parking spaces may be restricted to use by each owner’s employees, customers, and visitors only. (1) Interparcel vehicle access shall be required between contiguous properties only when the parking areas are or will be in reasonable proximity to one another. (2) All internal access easements shall be no less than 28 feet in width and shall be improved to a minimum paved width of 24 feet in order to accommodate two-way vehicular traffic to and from the adjoining properties. (3) The granting of an internal access easement on a property shall be effective only upon the granting of a reciprocal easement by the adjoining property owner. (4) Upon the availability of access to driveways and parking areas of the adjoining lot, the pave- ment or other surfacing of each owner’s driveways and parking areas shall be extended by each owner to the point of access on the property line. (c) Relief. Where the proposed land use is such that adverse impact of the required easement on use of the property would outweigh the reduced impact on the public street provided by the reciprocal ease- ments, the Planning and Development Director may waive the requirement for the access ease- ments, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Administrative Approval provisions in the Ap- peals Article of this UDC. Section 404. Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces Required. 404.01 Off-Street Parking, General Requirements. This section shall provide for the minimum and maximum number of off-street parking spaces based on use. (a) See Table 4-B for the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces. (b) For each use, the total number of spaces provided shall not exceed 120% of the minimum spaces required. (c) Parking for Company-Owned Vehicles Not Included. Every business that stores vehicles owned by the business on site overnight (such as a company fleet), or maintains a stock of vehicles as part of its business activities (such as a car sales lot, car rental agency, etc. ), shall provide for adequate parking or storage for the vehicles such that no parking occurs in a public right-of-way or in an area that has not been improved as a parking lot or storage yard. Such parking spaces shall be in addition to those required for residents, employ- ees, customers, and visitors. (d) Maneuvering Lanes Not Considered Parking. Areas designated for temporary occupancy of vehicles while maneuvering on a site, such as queu- ing lanes for a drive-in window, are not considered parking spaces. (e) See the Use of Land and Structures Article of this Development Code for off-street parking re- quirements in the CBD District and DOD Overlay District.

City of Duluth UDC 5-4 ment of an existing roadway, the provision of stormwater drainage facilities, or the construction or improvement of public utilities, or which has six or more lots (not in a large lot minor subdivi- sion), building sites or other divisions. (b) Major subdivisions fall into the following categories for the purpose of development regulation: (1) Conventional subdivisions, in which the minimum lot size allowed for the zoning district determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, and all of the lots meet the minimum lot size for the zoning district as shown in the Use of Land and Structures Article of this Development Code. Common open space outside of the lots may be created, but is not required, with the exception that conservation areas as defined by this Article are re- quired to be protected (see Section 505). (2) Conservation subdivisions, in which the maximum number of lots that would be allowed in a traditional subdivision under the property’s zoning determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, but the minimum lot size may be reduced in response to a higher level of development standards and in order to create more conservation areas and recrea- tional amenities for the residents. (3) Planned unit developments (PUDs), in which a mixture and/or increased density of land uses is allowed in response to a higher level of development standards and in order to effi- ciently use the land and organize uses. (4) Other planned developments, which include manufactured home parks, apartment build- ings and complexes, condominiums, and commercial developments consisting of three or more businesses. For the purposes of this Article, planned developments other than PUDs are controlled by the provisions of their respective zoning districts. (c) Permanent Protection Required. All conservation areas in a conventional subdivision, conservation subdivision or PUD that are required to be protected by the provisions of this Article, shall be permanently protected from further subdivision, development, and unauthorized use, by the method described in Section 505 of this Article. (d) Summary Table. Table 5-A presents a summary of the requirements of this Article as they apply to each of the types of major subdivisions and developments.

Conventional Subdivisions. 502.01 Maximum Number of Lots. The maximum number of lots in a conventional subdivision shall be determined by the minimum lot size requirements of the zoning district in which the subdivision is located, with the exception of lots served by on-site sewer (septic tank) which shall be subject to the approval and lot size standards of the Gwinnett County Environmental Health Department. 502.02 Minimum Lot Size. In a conventional subdivision, the minimum total lot area and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the Use of Land and Structures Article establishes the minimum lot sizes for each lot. Section 503 Conservation Subdivisions. City of Duluth UDC 5-6 502.03 Minimum Lot Width, Setbacks. The lot width and setback requirements of Use of Land and Structures Article apply to each lot in a conventional subdivision. Section 503. Conservation Subdivisions. Conservation subdivisions, as defined herein, are allowed in the RA-200, R-100 and R-75 zoning districts provided that a conservation subdivision concept plan has been approved by City Coun- cil at the time of the rezoning of the property or by staff as part of the development review pro- cess for properties zoned RA-200, R-100 or R-75 as of the effective date of this Development Code. 503.01 Purpose. The purposes of a conservation subdivision include: (a) To provide residential subdivisions which permit flexibility of subdivision design in order to pro- mote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. (b) To allow clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils, which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. (c) To encourage the development of residential communities that are density neutral based on standard zoning and development standards, but designed to preserve and protect environmen- tal resources, scenic vistas, and natural and cultivated landscapes. (d) To enhance land, water, air, and tree resources by minimizing the area of land disturbance, re- ducing impervious surface, optimizing stream buffers, preserving tree cover and encouraging the conservation of environmentally sensitive areas and the provision of open space. (e) To reduce infrastructure maintenance costs due to efficient community design. (f) To provide open space and pedestrian linkages among residential communities and to encour- age recreation opportunities. (g) To preserve and protect contiguous undeveloped areas within the development. (h) To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, flood- plains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 503.02 General Standards. (a) Density Determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by yield plan or calculation, at the developer’s option. The yield plan or calculation shall be prepared by a Georgia registered engineer or landscape architect. (1) Yield Plan. A yield plan that shows the maximum number of lots a tract can support based on the property’s underlying zoning and development standards of this Development Code. The plan does not have to meet all of the formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given the site features and all applicable regu- lations. All standard zoning or development regulations must be met (including lot sizes, right-of-way widths, etc.) At a minimum, the plan must account for and depict standard  City of Duluth UDC Section 503 Conservation Subdivisions. 5-7 rights-of-ways, lot information (sizes, widths, and setbacks), drainage and detention areas, easements, floodplain, lakes, wetlands, streams, and stream buffers. (2) Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning district. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: a. Slopes over 25% of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area; b. The 100-year floodplain; c. Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area; d. Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act; and, e. Anticipated right-of-way needs for roads and utilities. (b) Minimum Conservation Area. (1) A minimum of 40% of a tract’s gross land area must be set aside and protected as a conser- vation area as defined herein. (2) At least 75% of the conservation area shall be in a contiguous tract. The conservation area should adjoin any other protected area, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future conservation area. (3) See also Section 503.04. (c) Development Requirements. Conservation subdivisions shall meet the following requirements: (1) Minimum Subdivision Size. Each tract proposed to be developed as a conservation subdivision must be a minimum of 10 contiguous acres. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibil- ity. (2) Lot Area. No minimum is established, except that no portion of the lot area may be located within the 100-year floodplain elevation. (3) Average Lot Width. The average width of all building lots, as defined by this Development Code, shall be at least 60 feet. Exception: Lots that abut properties not located within the conservation sub- division shall meet the standard width requirement of the underlying district; or, open space at least 50 feet wide shall be provided. (4) Minimum Road Frontage per Lot. Section 503 Conservation Subdivisions. City of Duluth UDC 5-8 The minimum required road frontage per lot shall be 40 feet. Exception: Road frontage may be reduced to 20 feet for lots with frontage upon cul-de-sac or “eyebrow cul-de-sac” turna- rounds. (5) Minimum Yard Areas (Setbacks). a. The minimum required front yard shall be 20 feet. Exception: The front yard setback may be reduced to 5 feet if dwellings are provided side or rear entry garages. To quali- fy for the reduced setback on a corner lot, side entry garages must be located to the side adjacent to an abutting lot. b. The minimum required rear yard shall be 20 feet. c. The minimum required side yard shall be 5 feet. (6) Exterior Project Street Frontage Landscape Buffer. A landscape buffer that is a minimum of 50 feet in width (not part of any building lot) shall be provided along the tract and any external roadways. Landscape entry features such as fences and walls may be allowed in the portion of the landscape buffer that is provided along any external roadways. (7) Maximum Building Height. The maximum building height shall be 35 feet. (8) Sodded Yards. All yards of dwelling lots shall be sodded. (9) Garages. Dwellings shall have a minimum of two-car garages. (10) Street Trees. A minimum of one non-ornamental shade tree with a minimum 3.5-inch caliper shall be provided prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for each lot along all roadways. (11) Underground Utilities. All utilities shall be located underground. 503.03 Application Requirements. (a) Existing Features Site Analysis. At time of development review, or if a zoning action is proposed, an existing features site analy- sis, sealed by a registered engineer or landscape architect, must be provided to identify areas that are most significant for designation as conservation areas. The existing features site analysis shall include the following information: (1) Property boundaries. (2) Delineation of streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features to include the source of this information. (3) All conservation areas labeled, as described in Section 505.

See Section 505. Section 504. Planned Unit Development (PUD). 504.01 Intent and Purpose. (a) The Planned Unit Development District is intended to: (1) Encourage larger scale planned development which will produce a logically organized and compatible set of land uses resulting in a higher overall quality of Planning and Develop- ment than if accomplished in incremental unplanned stages. (2) Allow a mixture and/or density of land uses not otherwise allowed in an established zoning district; by careful site planning the appropriate site improvements are incorporated into the plan that establish compatible relationships between the uses within the site and uses adjacent to the site. (3) Encourage creative site design which seeks to preserve the open space and unique envi- ronmental features, conserve energy through efficient building design and clustering, effi- ciently use the land, and increase the efficiency of public service delivery. (4) Provide flexibility in the application of area, height, bulk, placement and other zoning con- trols. (5) Promote land development in proper relation to the surrounding neighborhood. (6) Ensure that the design of the building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmoni- ous. Section 504 Planned Unit Development (PUD). City of Duluth UDC 5-10 (7) To be applied in a manner consistent with the Land Use Plan for the City of Duluth. (b) Planned Unit Development Districts are separate zoning districts and shall follow the same amendment procedures as other zoning districts. Unless otherwise stated in this Article, the de- velopment standards and the land uses that are presented with the application for amendment, shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part of the zoning approval. (c) Any PUD that was approved prior to the adoption of this Development Code or amendments to the Code shall continue to be developed under the provisions and conditions of zoning approval that applied at the time of rezoning. 504.02 Requirements for PUD Development. A planned unit development shall meet the following minimum requirements: (a) A minimum of 10% of the gross area of the site shall be retained in common open space that is required to be deeded as a separate tract to an Owners Association and shall forever remain as open space. The required common open space shall include any conservation areas within a conservation easement established in accordance with Section 505. (b) Additional common open space may be provided and may include active recreation areas for the proposed development, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, community facilities, etc. (c) PUDs comprised solely of multi-family dwellings (townhouses, condominiums and/or apart- ments) shall dedicate a minimum of 10% of the gross floor area to non-residential uses that benefit on-site residents. Example of acceptable non-residential uses include a gym, community room, concierge, etc. (d) A PUD that does not have access to a publicly-approved sewer system must meet all application requirements for wastewater disposal of the Gwinnett County Environmental Health Depart- ment. If sanitary sewer is proposed or required, it must be connected to a state-approved wastewater treatment facility, either privately or publicly owned. (e) Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets within a PUD, with the exception that sidewalks on one side of the street can provide pedestrian connectivity throughout the site. The construction standards of the required sidewalks are given in the Project Design and Construc- tion Standards Article of this Development Code. (f) Where PUD abuts an RA-200, R-100, R-75 district or other residential land use, said PUD shall contain a 50-foot wide buffer strip along the abutting property lines. The 50 feet shall be added to the side or rear yard requirements of the PUD; at least 15 feet of the 50-foot buffer strip shall be planted area.

Section 505 Conservation Areas. City of Duluth UDC 5-14 The purposes of this Section, among others, are as follows: (1) To recognize the current development rights of property owners established through zon- ing; (2) To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural fea- tures such as stream buffers and wetlands, by setting them aside from development; (3) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation; (4) To enhance water quality of streams and waterways, and to protect valuable groundwater resources; and (5) To provide notification to future property owners of natural resources that must be pro- tected on their property. 505.02 Designation of Conservation Areas. Conservation Areas are required to be protected in a Conservation Subdivision, a PUD, or any new subdivision. These areas are defined as follows: (a) Floodways within the 100-year Floodplain. These areas are designated on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific location on a preliminary plat for a subdivision or site development plan for a multi-family or nonresidential project. (b) Flood Hazard Areas. All areas within the 100-year floodplain but lying outside any floodway, wetland or other designated primary conservation area fall under this category. The boundaries of the 100- year floodplain are designated as the “flood hazard area” on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific loca- tion on a preliminary plat for a subdivision or site development plan for a multi-family or nonresidential project. (c) Required Stream Buffers. Natural vegetative stream buffers along the banks of all perennial streams and other state waters, as required by the Soil Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control provisions of the Erosion Control and Stormwater Management Article of this UDC. (d) Wetlands. Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 505.03 Allowed Uses in Conservation Areas. The following requirements apply only to land set aside under conservation or natural resource easements in fulfillment of the provisions of this Article. (a) Areas identified as conservation areas shall remain in their natural, undisturbed state.

Sign Regulations Section 601. Findings, Purpose and Intent. 601.01 Statement of Legislative Purpose. (a) The Mayor and Council recognize that signs provide an important medium through which individ- uals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard, as a detriment to property values, and as an aesthetic nuisance affecting the overall economic growth of Duluth. Numerous professional studies have been prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including the following: 1. Klauer, S.G., T.A.

(b) Based on a review of the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other re- lated studies, the Mayor and Council find that unregulated signs: (1) Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; (2) Can be a detriment to the public health; (3) Can hamper economic growth; (4) Can lower property values; (5) Can adversely impact public investments; (6) Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and (7) Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 601.02 Findings of Fact. The Mayor and Council find that: (a) Signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a neces- sary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. However, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public; (b) The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic;  Section 602 Definitions. City of Duluth UDC 6-2 (c) Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment; (d) Through proper regulation of signs, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. (e) Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues as balanced with concerns about freedom of expres- sion or speech are reasonably promoted in the City of Duluth by the provisions of this Article. 601.03 Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of these sign regulations are:  (a) To aid in the identification of businesses and other commercial establishments in the City for po- lice, fire and other emergency responses, and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies; (b) To protect the public health, morals and welfare from the display of unconstitutionally obscene language and the advertisement of illegal activities. (c) To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community; (d) To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment; (e) To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distrac- tions, hazards, and obstructions; (f) To maintain the City’s ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public; (g) To protect the historical character of the city; (h) To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the City of Duluth by allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with the compatibility of such expression or speech with other land uses and with the aesthetic and public health, safety and welfare concerns which the City of Duluth is charged by law and the Georgia Constitution with preserving and protecting; (i) To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations while supporting the pol- icies contained in the Comprehensive Plan.

In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Article and other articles of this Development Code or City ordinances, the most stringent requirements shall pre- vail and be controlling. 604.02 Computation of Sign Area. (a) Generally. (1) The area of a sign face or module shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, color, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets other regulations of the City and is clearly inci- dental to the display itself. (2) If a sign face is composed of two or more sign modules, the sign face area shall be the area of each module, measured in accordance with the preceding paragraph (1), totaled together. (3) The area of a sign structure shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the sign, by multiplying: a. The width of the body of the sign (exclusive of the sign’s base or decorative cap, if any) measured at the widest portion of the sign body; times  City of Duluth UDC Section 604 Requirements that Apply to Signs in General. 6-19 b. The total height of the sign as defined in this Article under “sign height.” (4) The following are examples of how sign structure and sign face area measurements are made; the signs shown are illustrative and only provided for clarity. (b) Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign face area of a sign structure with more than one side, and such sides are not more than 12 inches apart at their closest point, shall be computed as follows: (1) Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the sign face area shall be the total area of both sides. (2) Signs with three or more faces. a. For sign structures having only three sides and the interior angle formed between each of the sides is 60 degrees, the sign face area shall be taken as the area of the largest of the three sides. b. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the sign face area shall be either the largest sign on any one side, or the largest total of all sign faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees, whichever can be viewed from an adjoining street. Sign Face Area Three-sided Sign Structures  Section 604 Requirements that Apply to Signs in General. City of Duluth UDC 6-20 (c) Free-Form Signs. For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign’s words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design elements intended to convey the sign’s message shall establish the area of the sign face. Free-Form Sign                 Kiosk Sign  (d) Kiosks. For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be the largest meas- urement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure. 604.03 Number of Signs. (a) For the purpose of determining number of signs, a single sign shall be considered to be a single sign structure, display surface or display device containing the sign copy (as defined in this Devel- opment Code) or other elements organized, related, and composed to form a unit. (b) Refer to the definition of “sign face” and “sign copy” for additional information. 604.04 Height Measurements. (a) For a freestanding sign structure located within 100 feet of an adjacent street right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the following applies: (1) For a sign located on land at or above the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street, the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms or other site im- provements that raise the sign above the pre-construction natural grade of the land upon which the sign is placed shall be included in the height measurement of the sign. (2) For a sign located on land below the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street, the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the crown of the roadway to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms, elevated foundations or other site im- provements that raise the sign up to the level of the crown of the roadway shall not be in- cluded in the height measurement of the sign. City of Duluth UDC Section 604 Requirements that Apply to Signs in General. 6-21 (b) For a freestanding sign structure located 100 feet or more from an adjacent street right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical dis- tance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of any portion of the sign.

Individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this Article shall use water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design. (a) Principles and Techniques of Water-Efficient Landscaping. The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows: (1) Proper Location and Design - locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not re- quire excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants. (2) Turf Selection - selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region, and limiting turf areas. (3) Efficient Watering - once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants. Section 710 Purpose and Intent. City of Duluth UDC 7-14 (4) Soil Improvements - loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting ar- ea to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots. (5) Mulching - using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds. (6) Plant Selection - selecting plants according to their watering requirements and optimum lo- cations. (7) Maintenance - maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservations such as increas- ing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells. DIVISION III. TREE PRESERVATION AND TREE REPLACEMENT REGULATIONS. Section 710. Purpose and Intent. The City deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety and welfare to enact provisions for the preservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the in- discriminate removal of trees in the City without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property. The importance of trees is recognized for their shade, cooling, noise and wind re- duction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property, and their contribution to the general wellbeing and quality of life of the citizens of Duluth. Consistent with the expressed purpose of this Code Division, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain exist- ing, self-supporting trees as defined herein. It is also the intent of this Code Division that all ap- plicable sites within the City maintain or obtain a minimum tree density, as defined and ex- plained herein. Section 711. Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this Code Division: (a) The removal of trees from a developed residentially zoned, single-family lot. (b) The necessary removal of trees by a utility company within dedicated utility easements provided alternative methods to trenching are used when possible including boring and tunneling. (c) The removal of trees on public right-of-ways conducted by, on behalf of, or any activity pursuant to work to be dedicated to, a federal, state, county, municipal or other governmental agency in pursuance of its lawful activities or functions in the construction or improvement of public right- of-way. (d) The removal of trees from golf courses, lakes, and detention ponds and drainage easements. (e) The removal of any tree which has become or threatened to become a danger to human life or property or the removal of a diseased or infested tree to prevent the transmission of disease or infestation. The owner/developer, prior to removal of the diseased tree(s), shall provide a re- port from a professional arborist to the Planning and Development Director prior to tree remov- al. This report shall identify the conditions of the tree(s) that necessitate removal. In the case of immediate danger to life and property the tree may be taken down and an inspection requested to verify the condition of the tree. (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts shall be made to save Specimen Trees. City of Duluth UDC Section 712 Approval to Remove Trees. 7-15 Section 712.

City of Duluth UDC Section 713 Minimum Tree Density Requirements. 7-17 Section 713. Minimum Tree Density Requirements. (a) All sites within the City other than single-family residential lots shall maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term “unit” is an expression of basal area as defined herein, and is not synonymous with “tree”. (1) The density requirements must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to develop- ment. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this Code Division, or some com- bination of the two. Minimum tree density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in this Article. The developer shall be subject to the min- imum tree density requirement set forth in this Paragraph, but the developer shall base its density calculations on the net site area excluding the infrastructure improvements (roads, utility lines, detention ponds, etc.). In no event shall a parking lot be considered an infra- structure improvement. (2) A required buffer shall not be counted towards tree density. Tree Save Areas may be counted in overall density for up to a 50% credit on individual lot requirements for residen- tial lots. (b) All single-family residential lots being developed as a subdivision in the City shall maintain a min- imum tree density based upon the maximum number of trees that can be maintained within 20% of the lot’s Plantable Area, taking into consideration the standards established in this De- velopment Code for tree size and separation. The density requirement must be met whether or not the individual lot had trees prior to development. (c) Replanting lots shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree (minimum 2-inch caliper) for every three understory trees (minimum 1-inch caliper). (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save Speci- men Trees. (Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water retention location and the like). (e) Tree Save Areas are encouraged and will be given credit of up to 50% individual lot require- ments when the number of trees in the tree save areas is equal to or greater than the total number of trees required on the total number of lots within the subdivision. When a 50% reduc- tion on required trees is taken, the balance of the trees shall be planted in the front yard of the individual residential lots. (f) Specimen trees and stands of trees must be replaced by species with potentials for comparable size and quality. Tree replacement in addition to the minimum site tree density may be required in recompense for the removal of specimen trees. Section 714. Tree Survey Plan and Inventory. (a) The tree survey as required herein shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan prepared and sealed by a registered surveyor or certified engineer, arborist or landscape architect, noting the location of all trees within the area to be modified from its natural state and 25 feet beyond in each direction or to the property line, whichever is less. (b) All Specimen Trees and all trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size (caliper or DBH, whichever is applicable) and species. Section 715 Tree Protection. City of Duluth UDC 7-18 (c) Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested (over 5 acres). Speci- men Trees must be shown on the plan with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed. All Tree Protection and Tree Save Areas must be delineated on the plan. All Buffers with existing trees must be delineated on plans as Tree Save Areas. Land disturbance within any Buffer is subject to Planning and Development Department approval. Section 715. Tree Protection. (a) The cleaning of equipment, storage of materials or dirt, disposal of waste material such as paint, oil solvent or other harmful substances, or any other such act which may be harmful to the con- tinued vitality of the tree(s) within the Tree Protection Area, is prohibited. (b) Prior to commencement of any grading, construction or tree removal, a Tree Protection Area for any tree located within 25 feet of any proposed grading, construction or tree removal must be established by physical barrier and maintained until such work is completed. Section 716. Tree Preservation Standards. Prior to any tree removal or commencement of construction on a site, the following system shall be used: (a) Location and Types of Tree Protection Devices. (1) Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or otherwise com- pletely surrounding the critical root zone of all the trees to be preserved. (2) The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or pas- sive. (3) Active protection (see Materials section below) is required where Tree Save Areas are located in proximity to construction activity. (4) Passive protection (see Materials section below) may be used in more remote loca- tions and in all protected zones not desig- nated as Tree Save Areas. (5) The locations and installation of all tree protection devices will be verified prior to the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading. All Tree Pro- tection Devices must be maintained intact throughout construction. (6) Once Protected Zones are established and approved, any changes are subject to Planning and Development Department review.

Any tree designated in the plan to be saved that is damaged during construction or as a result of such construction, shall be treated according to accepted National Arborists Association Standards, or re- placed with a tree(s) equal to the unit value of the tree removed. However, any Specimen Tree dam- aged as described above shall be replaced with a tree(s) two times the unit value of the tree re- moved. Section 718. Tree Planting Standards. (a) Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure to reasonable expectation of survivability. (b) It is desirable that replanted trees be ecologically compatible with the site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed unless the trees that were removed were non-native. (c) Replacement trees shall be of a native species appropriate for the Plant Hardiness Zone(s) for Gwinnett County as defined by the Cooperative Extension, University of Georgia College of Agri- cultural and Environmental Sciences or as recommended by the Georgia Forestry Commission.

City of Duluth UDC Section 722 Calculating Tree Density. 7-23 721.02 Violation and Penalty. Any person violating provisions of this Article shall be guilty of violating duly adopted Article of the City of Duluth, and upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, may be punished either by a fine not to exceed $1,000, or confinement in the City jail not to exceed 60 days, or both. Each day of non-compliance shall constitute a separate offense. The Court shall have the power and authority to place any person found guilty of a violation of this Article on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of said suspension, the Court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law which may include mandatory attendance at an education- al program regarding tree preservation. The owner of any property wherein a violation exists, and any builder, contractor, or agent, who may have assisted in the commission of any such violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense. Section 722. Calculating Tree Density. A basic requirement of this Code Division is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term “unit” is an expression of basal area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with “tree.” A single tree equal to one tree unit is between 13 and 14 inches in diameter. This density requirement must be met whether or not the site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula below. SDF = EDF + RDF SDF (Site Density Factor): The minimum tree density requirement to be maintained on a developed site, expressed in units per acre. EDF (Existing Density Factor): The total number of tree density units measured or calculated based on trees that will remain as conserved on site. RDF (Replacement Density Factor): Density or total unit value of new trees to be planted on a site. The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by units per acre required: Example: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 x 20 units per acre = 44 units The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units using Table 7-B. An example of determining the EDF by identifying the trees inventoried in a tree save area is shown below:        Trees Found (DBH) Quantity Unit Value* Total 5” - 8” pines 21 x 0.3 = 6.3 9” - 12” oaks 14 x 0.6 = 8.4 13” - 16” oaks 10 x 1.2 = 12 17” - 20” poplars 5 x 1.9 = 9.5 21” - 24” oaks 3 x 2.8 = 8.4  Total 44.6 Density Units (EDF) *See Table 7-B   Section 722 Calculating Tree Density. City of Duluth UDC 7-24 Therefore, with a SDF requirement of 44 units, a tree save area totaling 44.6 density units satisfies the site density requirement. These trees will be protected in a tree save area. To determine tree density on large sites, sample areas should be taken in areas to remain undisturbed. An approved timber cruising method (50’ x 50’ sample areas or Prism Method sampling) is required. Sample areas shall be flagged onsite, and locations delineated on the tree preservation plan. Table 7-B: Converting Existing Tree Diameters (DBH) to Density Factor Units Diameters Density Factor Units 1 – 2 inches  Need not be counted 3 – 4 inches 0.1 5 – 8 inches 0.3 9 – 12 inches 0.6 13 – 16 inches 1.2 17 – 20 inches 1.9 21 – 24 inches 2.8 25 – 28 inches 3.8 29 – 32 inches 5.1 33 – 36 inches 6.5 37 – 40 inches 8.1  The unit value of any individual tree may be determined by using the formula: (Diameter2) x .7854 ÷ 144 Replacement Density Factor (RDF): If enough trees do not exist onsite to meet the tree density requirements, replacement trees will be needed. Calculate the RDF by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. For instance, if it was determined that the 2.2. acre sample site from the previous example had only enough existing trees to yield a 30 unit per acre EDF, then replacement trees totaling 14 density factor units would be required: SDF (44) – EDF (30) = RDF (14) The density factor credit unit value for each caliper size or replacement (new) trees is provided in Table 7-C. Replacement tree caliper is measured at a point on the trunk 6 inches from the base. Table 7-B: Conversion of Replacement Tree Caliper to Density Factor Units (planted at ratio of 1 Overstory to 3 Understory trees) Caliper Size Density Factor Units 1 inch Not to be used 2 inches 0.4 3 inches 0.5 4 inches 0.7 5 inches 0.9 6 inches 1.0 7 inches 1.2 8 inches 1.3 9 inches 1.5  City of Duluth UDC Section 723 Specimen Trees. 7-25 Table 7-B: Conversion of Replacement Tree Caliper to Density Factor Units (planted at ratio of 1 Overstory to 3 Understory trees) Caliper Size Density Factor Units 10 inches 1.7 11 inches 1.9 12 inches 2.1 13 inches 2.3 14 inches 2.5 15 inches 2.8 NOTE: Tree diameter is measured at diameter breast height (dbh) or at any point below dbh for new trees or multi-trunked species, but in no case less than 6 inches from the ground. NOTE: Tree diameter fractions may be rounded up if 0.5 inches or greater or rounded down if less than 0.5 inches. NOTE: Multi-trunked ornamental trees shall be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk only. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit. Container grown pine trees are given density factor credit as follows: 7 Gallons - .4 units. In order to qualify for credit, each such container grown pine tree shall be at least 4 feet tall, and have a trunk not less than 1 caliper inch. The use of 1 and 3 gallon pines is permitted only with prior approval. The values in Table 7-C shall also be used to determine the quantity of replacement trees for any specimen tree recompense planting. Plantings replacing specimen trees are additional to planting required for site density requirements. See Sec. 723 below for specimen tree descriptions and requirements. Section 723. Specimen Trees. (a) Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. (b) The following criteria are used by the Planning and Development Director to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition must be met for a tree to qualify. (c) No specimen tree may be removed without prior written approval from the Planning and Devel- opment Director. 723.02 Size Criteria (a) Overstory Trees: 24-inch diameter or larger hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, poplars, sweet gums, etc. 30-inch diameter or larger softwoods, such as pines, cedars, etc. (b) Understory Trees: 6-inch diameter or larger such as dogwoods, redbuds, etc. 723.03 Condition Criteria (a) Life expectancy of greater than 15 years. (b) Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. (c) No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). (d) No major insect or pathological problems. Section 724 Examples of Single Family Lot Tree Planting Requirements. City of Duluth UDC 7-26 (e) In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be 2 times the assigned unit value shown in Section 722. (f) If a specimen tree must be removed, due to criteria established in this Code Division, it will be replaced by a species with potential for comparable size and quality. All specimen trees re- moved must be replaced at a density of two (2.0) times the unit value of the tree removed, i.e., 30-inch diameter specimen trees (4.9 density units) must be replaced with 9.8 units. Species se- lection is subject to the approval of the Planning and Development Director. (g) Any specimen tree, which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the Plan- ning and Development Director, must be replaced by trees with a minimum caliper size of 5 inches per tree with a total density equal to 3 times the unit value of the tree removed. In addi- tion, the City’s Code Enforcement Officer will issue a citation for the removal of a specimen tree without appropriate review and approval of the Planning and Development Director requiring an appearance in the City’s Municipal Court. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval. (h) The Planning and Development Director may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one or more specimen trees and the specimen trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the specimen tree if other members of the stand were to be removed.

All land development activity subject to this Code Division shall meet the following requirements:  City of Duluth UDC Section 803 Land Development Requirements. 8-5 (a) An undisturbed buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. The land forming the bank is also considered part of the buffer for purposes of this Code Division. (b) An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undis- turbed buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. (c) No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to Section 803.02 herein. 803.02 Variance Procedures. Variance requests from the requirements of this Code Division shall be submitted on an application form as prescribed by the Planning and Development Director or the director’s designee, along with such fees as shall be established by the Mayor and City Council. The Planning and Development Direc- tor or the director’s designee shall coordinate the review of each variance request with all other af- fected City of Duluth departments and shall forward such comments or recommendations as may be received to the Zoning Board of Appeals for action in their normal course of business. The review must include a recommendation from the Planning and Development Department. This section describes how to apply for a variance from this Code Division, however any activity within a state waters’ buffer must meet State requirements. (a) Variances may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: (1) The project involves the construction of one single family home for residential use by the owner of the subject property on a parcel that was platted prior to the effective date of this Code Division, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this Code Division, and the Planning and Development Depart- ment finds and determines that the requirements of this Code Division prohibit the other- wise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a vari- ance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to use a consent agenda to fulfill the terms of this Subsection. (2) Except as provided above, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall grant no variance from any pro- vision of this Code Division without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Board. The Planning and Development Department shall follow the Public Hearing, or “notice”, re- quirements for a variance to be heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided in the Procedures and Permits Article of this UDC. No application or reapplication for a variance affecting the same stream segment on a prop- erty shall be heard within 12 months from the date of last action by the Zoning Board of Appeals unless such 12-month period is waived by the Zoning Board of Appeals, and in no case may such application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Section 803 Land Development Requirements. City of Duluth UDC 8-6 (b) Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this Code Division, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. (c) Variances will be considered only in the following cases: (1) The applicant provides evidence that impacts to the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the fullest extent practicable; and (2) The project involves the construction or repair of a structure that, by its nature, must be located within the buffer. Such structures include dams and detention/retention ponds; or (3) Paved recreational foot trails and viewing areas, providing that impacts to the buffer are minimal; or (4) The proposed land disturbing activity within the buffer will receive a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 U.S.C. Section 1344, and the Corps of Engineers has received a mitigation plan to be implemented as a condition of such a permit. In addition, land disturbing activities in the buffer that are outside the USACE’s jurisdiction must be mit- igated; or (5) The buffer intrusion is mitigated using the procedure established in the Gwinnett County Stormwater Design Manual; or (6) A valid and complete application for rezoning of the property is submitted prior to the effec- tive date of this Code Division and approval of the rezoning by the Board of Commissioners occurs after the effective date of this Code Division application, and the variance request is consistent with the intent of this Code Division factoring into account the property owner's reliance on standards in effect at the time of the rezoning. (d) At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: (1) A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; (2) A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical char- acteristics of the property; (3) A dated site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; (4) Documentation that impacts to the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the fullest extent practicable; (5) A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; (6) A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; (7) Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion.

The Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Ordinance adopted by the City on April 8, 1985, is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set out in this Code. Copies of such ordinance are on file and available for inspection in the offices of the City. DIVISION III. WETLANDS PROTECTION. Section 810. Purpose. (a) The wetlands in the City of Duluth are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wet- lands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource edu- cation; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise man- agement of forested wetlands is essential to the economic wellbeing of many communities within the State of Georgia. (b) Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or im- paired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. (c) The purpose of this Code Division is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as deter- mined through a permitting process. Section 811. Definitions Relating to Wetlands Protection. Wetlands. Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of veg- etation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. Generalized Wetlands Map. The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for the City of Duluth, Georgia. Jurisdictional Wetland. An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Jurisdictional Wetland Determination. A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended. Regulated Activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the dis- charge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. City of Duluth UDC Section 812 Establishment of the Wetlands Protection District. 8-13 Section 812. Establishment of the Wetlands Protection District. (a) The Wetlands Protection District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Duluth, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the Gen- eralized Wetlands Map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Arti- cle, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. (b) The Generalized Wetlands Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within City of Duluth and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Code Division does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. Section 813. Protection Criteria. Requirement for Local Permit or Permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protec- tion District without written permission or a permit from the City of Duluth. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District boundary, as determined by the City of Duluth Planning and Development Director using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued. Section 814. Allowed Uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the Wetlands Protection District to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. [The ac- tivities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. How- ever, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.] (a) Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the Unites States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. (b) Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. (c) Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Geor- gia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

(f) Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. (g) All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 816.02 Activities to Comply with Site Plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the de- velopment, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill or removal of the overall appearance of the development as proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the Director of the Planning and Development Department. Minor changes, such as the realignment of streets or minor alterations to drainage structures and other in- frastructure to meet unexpected conditions are exempted from this requirement. 816.03 Exemptions to Site Plan Requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirement for detailed site plans. (a) Single-family detached homes constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels. (b) Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development.

DIVISION IV. WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS. Section 817. Purpose. (a) In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Duluth and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threat- ened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sed- iment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering waters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manu- facture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. (b) The purpose of this Code Division is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the City of Duluth; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This Code Division shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the City of Duluth. Section 818. Definitions Related to Water Supply Watersheds. Buffer. A natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed. Corridor. All land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in this Code Division. Impervious Surface. A man-made structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of storm water into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios. Large Water Supply Watershed. A watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.

DIVISION V. GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS. Section 822. Purpose. (a) In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Duluth and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water re- sources that City of Duluth and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. (b) Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth’s surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of sur- face water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant ground- water recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. City of Duluth UDC Section 823 Definitions Related to Groundwater Recharge Areas. 8-21  Section 823. Definitions Related to Groundwater Recharge Areas. Aquifer. Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or pro- ducing water from a well. Drastic.

Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, flood- ways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: (a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (b) below. (b) Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, (c) If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroach- ment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Planning and Development De- partment until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by Planning and Development Department. 836.06 Maintenance Requirements. (a) The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. (b) The Planning and Development Department may direct the property owner (at no cost to city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not per- formed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the Planning and Development Department.

Accessory structures and facilities (i.e., barns, sheds, gazebos, detached garages, parking lots, recreational facilities and other similar non-habitable structures and facilities) which are permitted to be located within the limits of the floodplain shall be con- structed of flood-resistant materials and designed to pass all floodwater in accordance with Sec- tion 837.01(e) and be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the struc- ture. (d) Standards for Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: (1) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for high- way use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security de- vices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or (2) The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for residential buildings—substan- tial improvements, subsection (a)(2), including the anchoring and elevation requirements. (e) Standards for Manufactured Homes. Section 837 Provisions for Flood Damage Reduction. City of Duluth UDC 8-40 (1) New manufactured homes shall not be allowed to be placed within the limits of the future- conditions floodplain unless all requirements of Sections 836.03, 836.04 and 836.05 have been met. If all of the requirements of Sections 836.03, 836.04 and 836.05 have been met, all new construction and substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor, including base- ment, elevated no lower than 3 feet above the base flood elevation or 1 foot above the fu- ture-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate the structure, opening sufficient to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 837.01(e)(1). (2) Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision shall be elevated so that either: a. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than 3 feet above the level of the base flood elevation, or 1 foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher; or b. The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. (3) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement in accordance with standards of Section 837.01(g). 837.03 Building Standards for Structures and Buildings Authorized Adjacent to the Future-Conditions Flood- plain. (a) Residential Buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal residen- tial building or manufactured home, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least 3 feet above the base flood elevation or 1 foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate the structure, openings sufficient to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 837.01(e)(1). (b) Nonresidential Buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal non- residential building, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the build- ing, shall be at least 1 foot above the level of the base flood elevation or at least as high as the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate the structure, openings sufficient to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 837.01(e)(1). Non-residential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. 837.04 Building Standards for Residential Single-Lot Developments on Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and/or Floodway (A-Zones). (a) For a residential single-lot development not part of a subdivision that has areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), the Planning and Development Director shall review and reasonably utilize any available scientific or historic flood elevation data, base flood elevation and floodway data, or future-conditions flood elevation data available from a federal, state, local or other source, in order to administer the provisions and standards of this Article. City of Duluth UDC Section 837 Provisions for Flood Damage Reduction. 8-41 (b) If data are not available from any of these sources, the following provisions shall apply: (1) No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to twice the width of the stream or 50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream, whichever is greater. (2) In special flood hazard areas without base flood or future-conditions flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than 3 feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unim- peded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with Section 837.01(e). 837.05 Building Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO-zones). Areas of special flood hazard may include designated ""AO"" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. In these areas the following provisions apply: (a) New and all substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than 1 foot above the flood depth number in feet specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least 3 feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded move- ments of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of 837.01(e). (b) New and substantial improvements of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus 1 foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A reg- istered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construc- tion are in accordance with accepted standards of practice and shall provide such certification to the Director of the Planning and Development Department using the FEMA Floodproofing Certif- icate along with the design and operation/maintenance plan; and, (c) Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed struc- ture. 837.06 Standards for Subdivisions. (a) All subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and Areas of Future-condi- tions Flood hazard therein and provide base flood elevation data and future-conditions flood ele- vation data; (b) All residential lots in a subdivision proposal shall have sufficient buildable area outside of the fu- ture-conditions floodplain such that encroachments into the future-conditions floodplain for res- idential structures will not be required; (c) All subdivision plans will provide the elevations of proposed structures in accordance with Section 835.02; (d) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;  Section 837 Provisions for Flood Damage Reduction. City of Duluth UDC 8-42 (e) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood wa- ters, and discharges from the systems into flood waters; and, All subdivision proposals shall include adequate drainage and stormwater management facilities per the requirements of the city to reduce potential exposure to flood hazards. 9-i  Article 9. Project Design and Construction Standards Article 9 sets out the minimum requirements and standards for construction of subdivisions and other land development pro- jects, including general principals of design and layout, and re- quirements for such public facilities as streets and utilities.
