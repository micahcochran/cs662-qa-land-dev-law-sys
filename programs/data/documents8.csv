COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
It is the   intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in   design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include one   or more retail sales, service and office enterprises on a single parcel of land in the form generally   known as a ―one stop shopping center.‖      In the case for a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the Planning   Commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for pedestrian and vehicular   circulation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, the application of the   usual requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement is not intended within the Planned Unit   Development.
The application of these usual restrictions in certain large-scale developments may   have results affording less protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if this is intended   measure of flexibility were permitted.
The intent of this district is to increase the desirability and   convenience to the users of the development without causing adverse effects on the adjoining   properties.
The minimum size of a Commercial Planned Unit Development District is 4 acres.
Within the Commercial Planned Unit Development Districts, the following regulations shall apply:      Section 14.02.

Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   122   ARTICLE XV     DESIGN STANDARDS FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT  (Adopted 2/18/03)      Section 15.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Design standards for commercial development   established in this article are intended to visually indicate proximity to downtown by keying off of   the historic commercial and industrial styles present in town, to maintain the character of the rural   highway experience with informal architecture, required building setbacks, and landscaping while   allowing for flexibility in design, and to re-establish, promote, and/or preserve the rural landscape.
The intent of the district also is to implement further the following policies of the Comprehensive   Plan: To further identify scenic views and determine strategies for retaining such areas, to protect   viable and stable neighborhoods from uses not in keeping with their established character and use, to   guide commercial growth and development should to commercial clusters and away from strip   development, and to encourage the strategic development of the East By-Pass (a.k.a.
Veterans   Parkway) in order to maintain its integrity as a major U. S. Highway.
Section 15.02 APPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS.
The design standards for commercial   development shall be applicable to all commercial zones- C-1, C-1R, C-1T, C-2, C-2R, C-3, C-3R,   C-4, C-PUD.
In the C-1, C-1R, C-1T, C-2, and C-2R Districts, the standards of Building Zone 1 as   established in the criteria of Section 15.05 shall apply in order to protect viable and stable   neighborhoods from uses not in keeping with their established character.
In the C-3, C-3R, C-4, C-  PUD, the standards of Building Zone 1 or Building Zone 2 as established in the criteria of Section   15.05 shall apply to allow greater flexibility in the design options, since such districts typically are   oriented towards major thoroughfares and outside of neighborhoods.
Section 15.03 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF PERMIT.
At the   time of submission of building plans for plan review for building permit approval, the applicant shall   submit detailed architectural drawings demonstrating compliance with the design standards.
No   plans shall be accepted without drawings in sufficient detail to allow Community Development and   planning staff to assess compliance.
Within ten- (10) business days, the Community Development   and Planning Director, or his/her designee shall review the architectural drawings and determine if   the proposed design complies with the standards established in Section 15.05.
If the proposed design does not meet the standards, the Community Development and Planning   Director, or his/her designee, shall submit to the applicant in writing via certified mail with return   receipt the standards with which the proposed design does not comply.
The applicant shall have ten   (10) business days from receipt of the notification to resubmit architectural drawings demonstrating   compliance with the standards.
Failure to resubmit architectural drawings within the specified time   period will result in denial of the application for a building permit.
The applicant shall have the right   to appeal the decision of the Community Development and Planning Director, or his/her designee, to   the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission only after the applicant has resubmitted   architectural drawings in accordance with the process above and the Community Development and   Planning Director, or his/her designee, has determined the revised drawings do not comply with the   design standards.
Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   123   Section 15.04 PERMITTED USES.

d. Architectural Standards      The goals of the architectural standards are to encourage an informal character of the rural   highway experience in undeveloped corridors of the City of Moultrie, to preserve the context and   character of the City of Moultrie, and to encourage creativity and high quality design and   construction.
The concepts that serve as the basis for the architectural standards are to:      (1) Locate new construction within the designated building zones.
Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   126   FIGURE 15.B – Development Option 1 – Individual Businesses with Single and Shared Accesses             Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   127   FIGURE 15.C – Development Option 2 – Limited Access Business Clusters                Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   128   (2) Group businesses when possible into informal clusters to appear as ―farm units.‖      (3) Restrict height to preserve rural appearance.
(4) Make buildings pedestrian friendly at street level.
(5) Draw upon existing architectural styles that are easily translated into contemporary   designs.
(6) Use existing commercial and industrial buildings in Moultrie for design ideas.
(7) Not imitate historic styles that can appear ―fake.‖      (8) Provide extra amenities that promote good environmental practices.
In order to achieve the above goals and implement the above design concepts, new commercial   development shall meet the following design standards as applicable:      (1) Building Orientation      (a) Buildings shall be oriented towards the commercial corridor that abuts it.
(b) The building shall be oriented to clearly demarcate and allow pedestrian entry and   access into the building.
(c) The building shall be oriented to allow for the location of parking in accordance   with paragraph ―a‖ of Section 15.05.
(2) Setbacks      (a) New construction shall be located only in the building zones defined in paragraph   ―a‖ of Section 15.05.
(b) Setbacks shall determine the degree of flexibility in architectural standards.
New   construction in Building Zone 1 shall meet all of the architectural standards   established in this subsection.
New construction in Building Zone 2 shall be   subject to less stringent architectural standards contingent upon meeting the buffer   requirements of Section 15.05.c.
(3) Scale      (a) Buildings shall be intimately scaled to provide a pedestrian friendly atmosphere.
Scale shall be determined by the distance across a space in relationship to   surrounding buildings.
The distance to height ratio shall not exceed four (4).
(b) The scale of new buildings shall be compatible with neighboring buildings.
Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   129      (4) Massing      (a) Buildings over 5,000 square feet in Building Zone 1 shall be broken up to look   like multiple buildings rather than one large ―box.‖  Figure 15.D illustrates a   possible arrangement for buildings over 5,000 square feet.
(b) The massing of buildings shall be varied to add interest to the structure.
This   shall be achieved by varying the horizontal and vertical planes of the exterior   walls and varying the height of distinct elements.
Figure 15.E illustrates desirable   versus undesirable elements.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
The intent of this Article is to permit certain   industries, which are of a light manufacturing character to locate in, planned areas of the City.
So   that such uses may be integrated with land uses, such as commercial and residential areas,   limitations are placed upon the degree of noise, smoke, glare, waste, and other features of industrial   operations so as to avoid adverse effects.

SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS.
a.
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
The requirements of area, height, bulk, and   placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of   record, would in certain cases of large-scale developments have results affording less   protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were   permitted.
The permitting of these planned unit developments as special exceptions can,   in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of   the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties.
Therefore, the Zoning Ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk, and placement   may be modified by the Planning Commission in the case for a plan of a large-scale   development which, in the judgement of the Planning Commission, provides adequate   open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air, and service   needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the   proposed planned unit development exceed that of the Zoning Ordinance requirements,   and provided further that the minimum site size for residential planned unit development is   three (3) acres and commercial planned unit development is four (4) acres.
b.
In the M-1, M-2, and AG Districts, publicly owned buildings, public utility buildings,   telephone exchange buildings, electric transformer stations and substations and gas   regulator stations necessary for the provision of essential services to the area by   governmental units or public utilities will be permitted on lots having the minimum area,   width, yard, and coverage requirements set forth in the R-1 District of this Ordinance.
c. Semi-detached dwellings constructed in R-2 or R-3 Districts shall have a minimum lot   area of 20,000 square feet.

In all residential districts, the width of side yards, which abut upon a street on the same   side on which other residential lot front, shall not be less than the required front yard   setback for, said other residential lots.
All buildings, structures, and accessory uses shall   maintain such required yard space.
Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   150   e. All accessory farm buildings for uses other than those incidental to dwelling, shall be   located not less than one hundred (100) feet from any dwelling and not less than twenty-  five (25) feet from any lot line or property boundary, with the exception that the main farm   barn building shall not be less than one hundred and fifty (150) feet from the front   property line.
This requirement shall not apply to alteration or addition to any existing   barn or accessory buildings which are located close to the road and which existed prior to   the adoption of this Ordinance.
f. Where a front yard of lesser depth than specified in the Schedule of Regulations exists in   front of dwellings on more than sixty (60%) percent of the lots of record on one side of the   street in any one block in R-1A, R-1B, and R-2 Districts, the depths of the front for any   building hereafter erected or replaced on any lot in such block need not be greater than the   average depth of front yards of such existing buildings.
g. For every lot for which a multiple residential dwelling is erected, there shall be provided a   side yard on each side of the lot.
Each side yard shall be increased beyond the yard spaces   indicated by one (1) foot for each ten (10) feet or part thereof by which the length of the   multiple, row, or terrace dwelling exceeds forty (40) feet in over all dimensions along the   adjoining lot line.
h. Side yard restrictions may be waived in C-1, C-2, and C-3 Districts to allow for party wall   construction, subject to approval from the Planning Commission, provided that a platted   alley adjoins the rear of the property and provided that continuous building development   shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet.
i.
The minimum floor area per dwelling unit shall not include area basements, open unheated   breezeways, and porches, attached garages or utility rooms,      j.

In exercising the above powers, the Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the   provisions of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify   the order, requirements, decisions, or determination, and to that end shall have all        Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011   159   the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct   the issuance of a permit.

2.7 F.A.A.
- the Federal Aviation Administration     2.8 F.C.C.
- the Federal Communications Commission     Section 3.
General Regulations and Requirements     3.1 Purpose and Intent        3.1.1 The purpose of the Section in accordance with the purpose of the Zoning      Resolution of the City of Helena to protect the public health, safety and      welfare, is to establish minimum location requirements, siting criteria and      development standards for wireless communications facilities, and to do      so in such a way as to be consistent with the Federal        - 105 -  Zoning Ordinance  UPD: 10.2021  v21.2      Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended.
It is therefore a       concurrent purpose of the Section to prevent discrimination between and      among the various providers in the wireless communication industry.
As authorized by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, as      amended, City of Helena finds it necessary to enact and enforce these      minimum standards and requirements, which are designed to assure      safety; ensure compatibility and adjacent land uses; protect against the      devaluation of property; preserve the character of existing communities      and their design; protect revitalization areas, historic areas and other      areas of special significance or public investment; avoid adverse visual      impacts to the City landscape; and discourage the unnecessary       proliferation of wireless  facilities.
It is the intent of this Section to encourage and maximize the use of      existing and approved (future) towers so that the construction of new      communications towers be an option of last resort.
To the extent feasible,     co-location of antennas on existing towers, or their attachment to       buildings, water towers and other suitable structures, should first be      sought.
However, where new tower construction is justified as being      absolutely necessary, compatible design measures, camouflaging       techniques and screening should be instituted to minimize any and all      detrimental effects to the area in which it is to be located.
3.2 Lighting Restrictions      3.2.1 There shall be no lighting on any towers except when required by the      F.A.A.
In cases where the F.A.A.
does require a tower to be lighted, only      red blinking lights shall be used at night; white strobe lights will not be      permitted for nighttime lighting.
Written documentation of any F.A.A.
directives to light a tower differently than provided herein must be       submitted with the zoning application.
Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of a low-density nature,      and shall not be directed or reflected away from/off of the site.
Wattage      of such lighting shall be restricted to the equivalent of a 150-watt bulb.
3.3 Co-Location Requirements      3.3.1 All towers constructed subsequent to the adoption of this Section, and      their associated compounds, shall be designed and built to accommodate     additional wireless communication service providers based on the height      of the tower as follows:          3.3.1.1  Towers 80 to 159 feet in height shall accommodate a        minimum of two (2) different providers, except as follows;     3.3.1.2  Towers 160 to 209 feet in height shall accommodate a        minimum of three (3) different providers, except as follows:     3.3.1.3  Towers 210 to 300 feet in height shall accommodate a        minimum of four (4) different providers.
- 106 -  Zoning Ordinance  UPD: 10.2021  v21.2      3.4 Maximum Utilization of Existing Sites      3.4.1 No new communications tower shall be constructed if space is       structurally, technically and economically available for the proposed      communications antenna(s) and related facilities on an existing tower, or      on an alternative site (e.g., building or other structure), where such      alternative location would cover the required service area without creating     undue signal interference.
3.5 Permission to Co-Locate Required      3.5.1 Pursuant to Items 3.3. and 3.4. above, and to the stated purpose and      intent of this Section, the owner of any existing communications tower      that has space structurally and technically available for any additional      communications antennas shall make such space reasonably and       economically available to other providers.
3.6 Visual Impact      3.6.1 All new communication towers shall be designed to minimize adverse      visual impacts on/from surrounding residential properties, the public right-     of-way, or historically significant or aesthetically-sensitive areas through      landscaping, camouflaging and/or other similar techniques, given the      topography of the tower site and the surrounding area.
3.7 Use Compatibility and Design Harmony       3.7.1 All new communications tower facilities must be compatible with the      surrounding land uses, given the character of use(s) and development      trends in the area around the tower site.
Said tower facilities shall be      designed, both structurally and with regard to finish or color, to be as      much in harmony as possible with the natural setting of the site and/or the     surrounding development pattern, as well as being up to the highest      industry standards.
3.8 Safety       3.8.1 All communication towers must comply with wind loading and all other      applicable structural safety standards, building and technical codes      having jurisdiction, so as not to endanger the health and safety of       residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the      tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God.
3.9 Security      3.9.1 A dark vinyl-coated, chain link steel fence shall be installed around the      perimeter of the compound, with a minimum height of eight feet (8') as      measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire, if applicable).
- 107 -  Zoning Ordinance  UPD: 10.2021  v21.2    3.10 Maintenance       3.10.1 The owner of a communications tower shall be responsible for       maintaining the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening,      buffers, security and other installations required by this Section, and by      any other applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, statutes or       conditions of approval imposed by the City of Helena or its authorized      representative, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site.
3.11 Abandoned Facilities      3.11.1 Any wireless communications facility that ceases to be used for its      original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s       expense.
The owner of the facility shall provide the Building Official with      a copy of the notice to the F.C.C.
of the intent to cease operations, and      shall have ninety (90) days from the date of such ceasing to remove the      obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its      natural condition.
In case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still      be required from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and      such provider will be required to remove its facilities with the ninety (90)      day period prescribed above.
At such time as all providers sharing use of     a tower cease operation of their facilities located thereon, the owner of      the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process as set forth      herein.
3.12 Violations      3.12.1 Any violation or other failure to comply with any provision of this Section      shall subject the violator to the fullest extend of the Remedies and       Penalties for Violation.
Section 4.
Area and Dimensional Requirements     For all of the above permitted uses, the area and dimensional regulations set for herein  shall be observed:     4.1 Minimum Lot Area: None     4.2 Minimum Yard Setback: 15 feet* on all sides, including front and rear, as      measured from the U-2 zoning district boundary to the required security fence.
* Yard setbacks may be reduced to zero feet (0') if the adjoining property is     zoned Commercial, Industrial or Utilities.
4.3 All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed     tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence.
(Guy      anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound.)

The     City of Helena reserves the right to require a planted and/or landscaped buffer     where appropriate in cases where existing natural vegetation is not available, or     is otherwise inadequate for use as a buffer as determined by the Building Official.
Section 5.
Height and Location Restrictions     In regard to the height and siting for all of the above permitted uses, the regulations set  forth herein shall be observed:     5.1 In relation to a residence:       5.1.1 No U-2 Communication Tower zoning district boundary shall be located      closer than five hundred feet (500') to any residence.
Provided, however,      that this requirement may be waived or otherwise modified with regard to      a residence owned by the leaser of a tower site.
However, such waiver or     modification shall be contingent upon said owner/leaser submitting an      affidavit indemnifying the City of Helena from any litigation, by the current      and any subsequent owners, relating to the tower and zoning in question.
5.2 In relation to a Protected Residential Area:      5.2.1 No U-2 Communications Tower zoning district boundary shall be located      closer than one thousand feet (1,000') to the nearest boundary (zoning or      otherwise) of any protected residential area (as defined in this Section).

on the same parcel.
Exemption of such facilities from the requirements of this Section, and the     subsequent permitting of same, shall be made only after administrative      review and approval by the Building Official.
7.4.7 Camouflaged Towers and Antennas.
Upon adoption of this Section, the      Use Regulations of all other zoning districts shall also be hereby       amended to allow camouflaged towers and communications antennas as      a conditional use in any zoning district.
The conditions of such allowance      shall be that it can be clearly demonstrated that such location is in full      accord with the Purpose and Intent of this Section; that the proposed      facility satisfies the requirements of Section 3, subsection f., Visual      Impact, and Section 3, subsection g., Use Compatibility and Design      Harmony, to the fullest extent possible; and, that such facility meets the      criteria set forth herein below.
The general criteria for the permitting of new antennas under this Sub-     Item shall include the siting of an antenna on structures, whether new or      existing, such that it can be made as unobtrusive as possible by blending      it into the surrounding environment.
Any new structures on which such antennas are to locate shall hereafter      be deemed to the “camouflaged towers” as defined previously in the      Section.
Such towers may also be permitted as conditional uses in any      zoning district, provided they meet the general criteria of being       constructed such that they appear as structures that are normal,       customary or otherwise unobtrusive within the context of the surrounding      environment.
Such towers may be multi-functional, such as functioning      as a working street light while simultaneously supporting a        communications antenna, or may otherwise be made unobtrusive through     the use of color, camouflaging, architectural treatment, incorporation into      other buildings or structures, etc.. Whatever technique is utilized, all      towers permitted under this Sub-Item must achieve a satisfactory       appearance within the context of the surrounding environment.
Existing structures proposed to be used for the site of communications      antennas must also meet the criteria set forth for new structures, and for      the purposes of this Section, shall also be considered “camouflaged      towers” when used to support a communications antenna.
In order for a permit to be issued under this Sub-Item, any and all new      towers and antennas shall be subject to administrative review and       approval by the Building Official.
The Building Official shall determine the     sufficiency of the camouflaging of each such tower and antenna, and      shall base his/her decision whether or not to issue such permit thereon.

City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     23  Article III: General Requirements 6.2  Yards and open spaces on substandard lots.
Where the owner of a property, at the time of  adoption of this Ordinance, has a lot or lots of official record which are substandard to the requirements  of the district in which they are located according to this Ordinance, the building and its accessory struc- tures may be built, provided:  A.
The yard space and other requirements conform as closely as possible, in the opinion of the Board of   Adjustment, to the requirements of the district in which the property is located.
B.
That neither side yard shall be reduced to less than five (5) feet.
C. No building shall be required to set back more than the average of the setbacks of the existing resi-  dences within one hundred (100) feet each side thereof, but in no case shall the front yard setback of  any building hereafter erected or altered be less than twenty (20) feet.
SECTION 7 - BUILDING SETBACK LINES     7.1  Properties abutting existing improved public streets.
When any required yard abuts a street  or roadway with an existing public street right-of-way of forty (40) feet or more, the setback shall be the  standard setback required in that zoning district.
The setback shall be measured from the property line.
7.2  Properties abutting street or roadways without dedicated rights-of-way.
When any re- quired yard abuts a street or roadway (public or private) without a dedicated right-of-way, the setback  shall be not less than twenty (20) feet, plus any additional setback required by the minimum dimensional  requirements for the applicable zoning district.
The setback shall be measured from the centerline of the  existing improved street or roadway.
7.3  Special Exemption from Front Yard Setback Requirements.
The City of Alexander City rec- ognizes that existing development in older sections of the community have established a street front- age line that may not fully comply with the specific front yard setback requirements of this ordinance.
Although compliance with required front yard setbacks is desirable to protect buildings from potential  future street widening projects and to ensure adequate front yards for landscaping and/or the provision  of on-site parking, the City does not wish to casually destroy the character and appeal of a street by rad- ically altering long-established street facades.
Therefore, the City shall permit special front yard setback  exemptions for buildings on lots that possess frontage on a street where the majority of the established,  pre-existing buildings do not comply with the applicable front yard setback requirements of this ordi- nance.
In accordance with this exemption provision, no building shall be required to set back more than  the average of the setbacks of the existing buildings within one hundred (100) feet each side thereof, but  in no case shall the front yard setback of any building hereafter erected or altered be less than twenty (20)  feet.
7.4  Future Street Lines.
On any lot which, at the time of adoption of this ordinance or at the time  this ordinance is changed by amendment, may be reduced in area by widening a public street to a future  street line as indicated in the duly adopted comprehensive plan, or as same may be hereafter amended,  the minimum required yards, the minimum required lot area, the minimum required lot width, and the  maximum building area shall be measured by considering the future street lines as the lot line of such lot.
7.5 Traffic Visibility.
Additional setback distances may be imposed to any lot or property as re- quired to maintain clear traffic visibility (as determined by the City Engineer and/or Building Official).
The  additional setback distances may be applied to regulate any obstruction, including, but not necessarily  limited to: buildings, trees, shrubs, decorations, wall or fences, and signs.
SECTION 8 - FRONTAGE ON CORNER LOTS AND DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS     24   Article III: General Requirements  On lots having frontage on more than one street, the side or rear yard setback along the secondary street  shall not be less than the required front yard setback for the applicable zoning district.
When the rear yard of  a lot abuts a public street, all buildings or structures in that rear yard shall observe the same setback from the  street right-of-way line as required for adjacent properties which front on that street.
In addition, any structure  located within 25 feet of that setback line shall observe the side yard requirements of the adjoining properties  fronting on that street.
SECTION 9 - ACCESS TO STREETS   No building for human occupancy shall be erected without unrestricted vehicular access to a public street or a  private street dedicated for public use and constructed in accordance with all applicable City street standards.
Furthermore, In order to promote the safety of the motorist and pedestrian and to minimize traffic congestion  and conflict by reducing the points of contact, the following regulation shall apply:   9.1  A point of access, i.e., a drive or other opening for vehicles onto a street, shall not exceed thirty  (30) feet in width, but if the street is a major street and freeways, or arterial street, the width shall not  exceed fifty (50) feet.
9.2  There shall be no more than two points of access to any one public street on a lot of any width,  unless required by the Board of Adjustment to provide adequate access to lots with more than four hun- dred (400) feet of continuous street frontage.
Lots less than one hundred (100) feet in width shall have no  more than one point of access to any one public street.
9.3  No point of access shall be allowed within fifty (50) feet of the right-of-way of any public street  inter-section.
However, a lessor distance may be authorized by the City Engineer, where conditions at  the intersection or the constraints of the property may so warrant, and where such adjustment shall not  compromise traffic safety or contribute to traffic congestion.
9.4  The area existing between the street and an interior parking space or driveway parallel to the  street shall have a curb at least six (6) inches in height and six (6) inches in width separating the parking  area from the sidewalk, to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto the sidewalk area.

The plan shall show how the above specific standards will be met.
11.4  Measurements shall be taken with an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) type I or  type 2 sound level meter using the a-weighted scale.
11.5  Reasonable flexibility and application of noise regulations shall be allowed for short time peri- ods, however, noises in excess of 90 dBA shall not be allowed at any time.
SECTION 12 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT   Stormwater runoff from construction sites and urban development is a significant source of surface water  contamination.
Since the clean ground and surface waters are important economic resources to Alexander  City, new development and construction activity must be designed to minimize on-site erosion and the re- sulting sedimentation of off-site water resources that can be generated by stormwater runoff.
Therefore, no  final inspection of a development site shall be conducted by the City until the developer has complied with  all applicable requirements of this Section.
The City may request assistance from the Natural Resource Con- servation District or other qualified experts in evaluating the applicant’s proposed measures to comply with  these requirements.
12.1  Exempt activities.
The following activities shall be exempt from these stormwater manage- ment requirements:  A.
Minor land disturbing activities normally associated with single family uses, such as home gardens,   landscaping, building repairs or alterations, swimming pool installation, or other related, low-impact  activities.
B.
Agricultural practices or the construction of farm buildings, when conducted in full compliance with  all applicable Best Management Practices.
C. Private and commercial forestry activities, when conducted in full compliance with all applicable Best  Management Practices.
12.2  ADEM permit required.
It shall be the developer’s responsibility to secure compliance with  all applicable Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) Construction Stormwater  Management Administrative Code rules, as amended, and/or any applicable ADEM construction site  permit requirements, which are designed to prevent/minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the  discharge of sediment and other pollutants in construction stormwater runoff to ensure the protection  of water quality in accordance with applicable Federal and State law.
Applicants subject to this require- ment shall provide evidence that a stormwater discharge permit has been issued by ADEM prior to the     26   Article III: General Requirements issuance of a zoning permit by the Enforcement Officer.
12.3  Tie-in required.
All proposed drainage improvements shall tie into any existing man-made or  natural drainageways along the existing public streets adjoining the development site.
Under no condi- tions shall stormwater drainage be emptied into the sanitary sewer system or vice-versa.
12.4  Basic guidelines.
Stormwater management measures shall be designed in accordance with all  applicable Best Management Practices for the proposed type of construction activity.
Appropriate short- term (during construction) and long-term (after construction is complete) measures shall be applied to  minimize potential erosion of disturbed soils on the development site.
All slopes on the development  site in excess of ten (10) percent grade shall be permanently stabilized through the use of natural vege- tation (preferably native vegetation), retaining walls, terracing, or a combination, as may be appropriate.
Development sites which will contain more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of impervious  surfaces or upon which more than fifty (50) percent of the total lot area will consist of impervious sur- faces shall contain adequate stormwater management facilities (detention or retention basins, drainage  ways, storm drains, etc.)
to accommodate on-site and safely release or transmit the runoff that would be  generated by a twenty-five (25) year storm event, without causing an increase or surge in the volume and  velocity of off-site peak stormwater runoff over the pre-development state.
However, if the site is located  within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone, the stormwater management facilities shall be designed to ac- commodate on-site and safely release or transmit the runoff that would be generated by a one hundred  (100) year storm event, without causing an increase or surge in the volume and velocity of off-site peak  stormwater runoff over the pre-development state.
12.5  Creative and innovative polluted runoff management practices.
Where feasible and appro- priate, proposed developments may incorporate creative and innovative design to minimize the impacts  of polluted runoff on the environment.
Such design features may include, but are not limited to, un- disturbed natural buffers between impervious surfaces and adjoining streams and drainageways, max- imum retention of existing mature trees on building lots, the use of seeded shallow “V” drainage swales  (with stabilized cut slopes not to exceed a ten [10] percent grade) rather than concrete curb and gutter,  the use of porous pavement surfaces for parking lots, service roads, alleys, and cul-de-sacs, the use of  crushed gravel or turf parking areas for small parking lots or spillover parking areas, and the creation of  wetlands for stormwater detention and retention, and other practices as may be appropriate to address  on-site stormwater drainage needs.
Such creative and innovative design features should be used in the  following development settings;   A. where they will be compatible with existing off-site stormwater management infrastructure improve- ments serving the drainage basin, and   B. where appropriate to adequately and safely accommodate the stormwater runoff that would be gen- erated by the proposed level of impervious surfaces without the need for excessive perpetual main- tenance.
12.6  Lot Drainage Standards.
The following design requirements for lot drainage shall be satisfied  in each Stormwater Management Plan:  A.
A positive slope of finish grade shall be provided around each structure to direct water away from all   foundations, slabs, or footings;  B.
Side lot swales shall be utilized, as necessary, to direct lot drainage into public drainage improve-  ments or easements;  C. Roof drains shall be utilized to prevent soil erosion and to prevent the accumulation of stormwater   runoff along structure foundations and footings.
Such drains shall be directed away from structures  and into swales or other drainage facilities;     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     27  Article III: General Requirements D. Driveway culvert pipe shall be the proper size to safely transmit design storm event drainage waters.
The inside diameter of such culvert pipe shall be at least fifteen (15) inches, and shall consist of a dou- ble wall plastic or concrete pipe;  E. All driveway and service drive piping shall be installed on an appropriate grade to prevent standing  water.
12.7  Erosion and Sediment Control.
The following erosion and sediment control measures shall  be observed for the construction and maintenance of all stormwater management facilities:  A.
Roadside ditches, swales, and embankments within each dedicated right-of-way or drainage ease-  ment shall be properly stabilized in accordance with applicable Best Management Practices to pre- vent excessive erosion from cut slopes;   B.
It shall the developer’s responsibility to provide the necessary measures to ensure that clearing, grub- bing, grading, landscaping, and other construction activities do not adversely affect the drainage  structures that are essential to overall stormwater management and control;   C. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to ensure proper implementation, regular inspection, and  continual maintenance of effective Best Management Practices for construction site erosion and sed- iment control;   D. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to promptly remove and/or remediate, to the extent practi- cable, any off-site sediment from the development site that is washed or deposited into municipal  stormwater drainage facilities.
12.8  Stormwater management on privately owned common open space lands.
Where any  stormwater management improvements are to be constructed on common open space lands within the  development, such improvements shall be subject to special maintenance provisions as required in Arti- cle IV, Section 10 (Common Open Space Requirements) of this Ordinance.
The City of Alexander City shall  assume no responsibility or liability for the continued, maintenance, improvement, or repair of privately  owned stormwater management facilities.
12.9 Stormwater management plan required.
A maintenance plan and schedule for stormwater  facilities for any commercial structures and subdivisions with greater than 50 lots shall be approved by  the City Engineer and Building Official before any permits shall be issued.
28   Article IV: Special Use Provisions ARTICLE IV SPECIAL USE PROVISIONS   SECTION 1 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES   1.1  Purpose of provisions.
Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance or by sub- sequent amendments to this Ordinance, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and  characteristics of use which were lawfully created, established, or constructed before this Ordinance was  adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this  Ordinance or of subsequent amendments.
It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconfor- mities to continue until they are removed or discontinued, but not to actively encourage their survival.
It  is further the intent of this Ordinance to ensure that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded, or  extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same  district.
Nonconforming status runs with the land; i.e., a change in ownership or tenancy does not termi- nate the nonconforming status of a lot and/or structure.
1.2  Incompatibility of nonconforming uses.
Nonconforming uses are declared by this Ordinance  to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the zoning districts in which they are located.
A noncon- forming use of land, of structure, or of land and structure in combination shall not be extended, enlarged,  moved, or otherwise intensified after passage of this Ordinance either by additions to any existing struc- ture or by the addition of other uses of the property which would be generally prohibited in the district  in which such use is located.
1.3  Vested rights.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require  a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building upon which actual construction  was lawfully initiated prior to the effective date of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance.
1.4  Abatement of noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, and fire and explosion hazard or  nuisance.
The Enforcement Officer may require the conduct of any use, conforming or nonconforming,  which results in unreasonable noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, radio interference, or explosion  hazard or nuisance to surrounding properties to be modified or changed to abate such hazards to health,  comfort, and convenience.
The Enforcement Officer may issue an abatement order, but such order may  be directed only after a public hearing has been conducted by said Enforcement Officer, notice of which  shall be sent by registered mail to the owners and/or operators of the property on which the use is con- ducted, in addition to due notice by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the com- munity.
A hearing to consider the issuance of an abatement order shall be held by the Enforcement  Officer either upon petition signed by any person affected by the alleged hazard or nuisance or upon  the Enforcement Officer’s initiative.
An abatement order shall be directed by the Enforcement Officer  only upon reasonable evidence of hazard or nuisance, and such order shall specify the date by which the  hazard or nuisance shall be abated.
1.5  Single nonconforming lots of record.
A lawfully created lot of record which does not meet  the minimum space and height requirements of the zoning district in which it is located at the effective  date of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance may be used or sold for the erection of those build- ings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out the permitted uses in that district, provided:   A.
Minimum space and height requirements of the lot shall conform as closely as possible to the appli- cable standards for the district.
B.
Requirements for yards and setbacks, accessory buildings and uses, and off-street parking and load- ing spaces shall conform as closely as possible to the applicable standards for the district.
C. Variance for area, dimensional, and other requirements shall be obtained only through action of the     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     29  Article IV: Special Use Provisions Board of Adjustment as authorized in Article VII, Section 5.3  of this Ordinance.
A variance shall only  be required where the proposed structure cannot be designed to comply with the applicable dimen- sional requirements of the zoning district.
1.6  Creation of Nonconforming Lots of Record Prohibited.
No existing lot of record (whether  conforming or nonconforming) shall be divided in a way that would create a lot that does not comply  with the applicable minimum space and height standards of this Ordinance.
Nothing in this provision  shall be interpreted to prevent the adjustment of an adjoining lot line or the resubdivision of a lot so  combined, where sufficient land area exists to establish more than one conforming lot.
1.7  Nonconforming Structures.
Where, at the effective date of adoption of or amendment to this  Ordinance, a lawful structure exists that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason  of not complying with minimum dimensional requirements or other requirements concerning the struc- ture, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:   A.
No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconfor- mity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
B.
A nonconforming structure which has been partially damaged by fire or other causes may be recon- structed and used as before if it is completely repaired within twelve (12) months of such damage.
However, should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed  by any means to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its fair market value immediately prior  to damage, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
C. Should such structure be voluntarily relocated or moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever,  no permit shall be issued unless and until it fully conforms (in regards to location, construction, and  use) to the requirements or standards for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
This pro- vision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the replacement of a pre-existing, nonconforming manu- factured or mobile home, as long as it is replaced with a conforming manufactured home, the unit is  placed in the exact location of the previous home or a more conforming location on the lot, and the  replacement manufactured home does not create any new dimensional nonconformities.
D. No building permit shall be issued for the remodeling or renovation of a building or structure which  contains a use that does not conform to the provisions of the district in which it is located, except as  provided in Section 1.7-B above.
Only routine maintenance for which no building permit is ordinarily  required shall be allowed.
1.8  Nonconforming Uses of Land/ Structure or Land and Structure in Combination.
Where,  at the time of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance, lawful uses of land, structure, or land and  structure in combination exist which, under the terms of this Ordinance, would not be permitted in the  zoning district in which they are located, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise  lawful, provided:   A.
No such nonconforming uses, nor structures devoted to nonconforming uses, shall be enlarged or  increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the  Ordinance or subsequent amendment that created the nonconformity.
B.
No such nonconforming uses, nor structures devoted to nonconforming uses, shall be moved in  whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the  effective date of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance, unless approved by the Board of Ad- justment as a special exception to specifically reduce or minimize the overall nuisance or impact  generated by the nonconforming use on all neighboring properties or to reduce or to specifically  eliminate one or more pre-existing dimensional nonconformities.
Where such a special exception is  requested, the Board of Adjustment shall also determine that the proposed relocation shall create no     30   Article IV: Special Use Provisions opportunities for expansion or intensification of the nonconforming use and will create no additional  or new dimensional nonconformities.
C. No additional structures (primary or accessory) shall be erected in connection with nonconforming  uses, unless approved by the Board of Adjustment as a special exception to specifically enclose a  pre-existing open air and essential activity of the use in a way that will significantly enhance the  exterior appearance of the property and screen, reduce, or eliminate the overall nuisance or impact  generated by the nonconforming use on all neighboring properties.
Where such a special exception  is requested, the Board of Adjustment shall also determine that the proposed new structure shall  create no opportunities for expansion or intensification of the nonconforming use and will create no  additional or new dimensional nonconformities.
Any such new structure permitted by special excep- tion shall not be classified as or permitted as a pre-existing, nonconforming structure.
D. If any such nonconforming uses are discontinued for a period of more than twelve (12) months, any  subsequent use of the land and/or structure formerly devoted to such nonconforming uses shall  thereafter conform to the requirements or standards specified by this Ordinance for the zoning dis- trict in which such land and/or structure is located.
E. If any nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, any subsequent use of the land and/or  structure formerly devoted to such nonconforming uses shall thereafter conform to the requirements  or standards for the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be  resumed.
F. A nonconforming use may change to a new nonconforming use as a special exception (subject to  appropriate conditions as warranted in this Ordinance for a special exception), where the Board of  Adjustment has determined that the new use is more consistent with the permitted uses of the dis- trict in which it is located and is less objectionable and generates fewer external impacts on neigh- boring uses and properties than the previous nonconforming use.
However, once the pre¬existing  nonconforming use has been replaced by a more conforming use, the prior nonconforming use may  not thereafter be resumed under any circumstances.
To determine whether the new use would be in  greater conformity with this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the six criteria listed  below.
In finding that the proposed use change will be in greater conformity, the Board of Adjust- ment shall conclude that at least one of the six criteria will be satisfied and that the proposed new use  shall cause no adverse impact under all of the remaining applicable criteria.
1.
The proposed use will reduce the amount of  traffic generation and congestion generated by the   property, including truck, passenger car, and pedestrian traffic.
2.
The proposed use will reduce or eliminate external noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat,   odor, glare, or vibration caused by the original nonconforming use.
3.
The nature of the proposed new use or business activity will be more consistent or compatible   with other uses permitted in the district.
4.
The scale and intensity of the new use or business activity will be clearly less or smaller than the   original nonconforming use.
5.
For all nonresidential uses, the proposed new use or business activity will be conducted during a   shorter time period and more reliably during regular weekday business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00  p.m.) than the original nonconforming use.
6.
The proposed new use or business activity will be conducted entirely within existing structures  on the premises, thereby eliminating pre-existing, nonconforming open air activities associated  with the original nonconforming use.
G. Where nonconforming use status applies to land and structure in combination, removal or destruc- tion of the structure to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its fair market value immediate- ly prior to damage shall terminate the nonconforming status of the structure but shall not terminate  the nonconforming status of the land.
City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     31  Article IV: Special Use Provisions 1.9 Repairs and Maintenance.
A.
On any structure devoted entirely or in part to a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary  maintenance, including remodeling, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring,  or plumbing, provided the maintenance, remodeling, or repair work shall not result in an increase in  the cubic content of the structure, as it existed at the effective date of the Ordinance or subsequent  amendment that created the nonconformity.

All skirting shall  be adequately vented.
3.4  Axles and tow bars removed.
Once a manufactured home has been placed on an individual  lot, all tow bars and axles shall be removed and stored in a location on the lot where they cannot be seen  from the street, neighboring homes, or adjoining properties.

City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     33  Article IV: Special Use Provisions 3.12  Use limitations.
No manufactured home may be used for any purpose other than as regulated  for residential use herein except in a nonresidential zoning district as provided below:   A.
As an office and storage for parts at a legally licensed manufactured home sales lot by the owner, real   estate office, or sales office.

3.13  Compatibility With Adjoining Residential Properties.
While the City of Alexander City ac- knowledges and accepts its responsibility to promote a wide range of affordable housing styles for its  residents, it also must recognize that manufactured homes are a distinct type of housing that can, un- der certain circumstances, alter or disrupt the stability of property values and character of established  residential neighborhoods that consist predominantly or exclusively of site-built single family detached  dwellings.
Such disruptions can be especially severe in neighborhoods that consist of historic homes that  represent and reflect a specific architectural style and character or that consist of uniformly high value  dwellings, relative to the value of a standard manufactured home.
In these special neighborhoods, the  City’s responsibility to provide siting flexibility for manufactured homes must be reasonably tempered  and balanced by the City’s competing responsibility to maintain the character, architectural integrity, and  property value stability of established single family residential neighborhoods.
Therefore, manufactured  homes may be permitted only in full compliance with the following special conditions:   A. the proposed manufactured home will not be located on a vacant lot that is within a designated local,  state, or federal historic district or a vacant lot that is adjacent to one or more structures that have  been listed on or are eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places;   B. the combined value of the proposed manufactured home and the property upon which it will be  sited shall not be less than ninety (90) percent of the average fair market value of all adjoining proper- ties that have been improved for single family residential use, according to the property value records  maintained by the County Tax Assessor’s Office;   C. no manufactured home shall be utilized as a parsonage on or adjacent to a lot containing a church;  and   D. each manufactured home shall comply with all applicable dimensional requirements and minimum  standards for dwellings required for the subject zoning district in which it will be located.
SECTION 4 - HOME OCCUPATIONS AND COTTAGE INDUSTRIES   4.1  Home Occupations.

B.
The board of adjustment may authorize a reduction of, or waiver, any of the off-street parking or load- ing-unloading regulations when it can be demonstrated clearly to the satisfaction of the board that  circumstances of extreme practical difficulty exist that would unquestionably result in hardship to  the applicant when a literal application of the regulations is required.

SECTION 6 - ACCESSORY RESIDENTIAL UNITS   Technological and medical advances have made it possible for people to live longer lives and to live more  independently than ever before.
At the same time, a declining number of young adults must provide care  and support for an expanding elderly population, despite increased work demands to make ends meet.
The  City of Alexander City understands the demands faced by working adults, and seeks to provide an option for  families to provide special and convenient care for elderly and handicapped members.
However, the City  must also preserve the character and integrity of single family neighborhoods and exercise appropriate reg-    City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     43  Article IV: Special Use Provisions ulatory constraints to guard against the potential proliferation of rental apartments in such neighborhoods.
The purpose of this Section is to establish basic standards for the development of accessory residential units  to provide a semi-independent living environment for family members who require special care and support  from the primary household.
Such a unit would provide greater privacy and personal freedom than an add- ed bedroom within the primary dwelling, but would not create an additional independent living unit that  would alter the character of the original single family structure and the surrounding neighborhood.
However,  nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the creation of an accessory residential unit to provide  in-home care for an elderly or handicapped family member.
Accessory residential units shall be allowed only  for single family dwellings, excluding manufactured homes.
Where permitted, all accessory residential units  must comply with all of the following requirements.
6.1  Incomplete facilities for exclusive personal use.
The purpose of this provision is to provide  opportunities for families to provide essential on-site care and support for elderly and handicapped  members, not to provide opportunities for families to create independent rental units for general leas- ing.
Therefore, accessory residential units must be designed to prevent independent use.
All accessory  residential units must lack either complete kitchen facilities or bathroom facilities for exclusive personal  use.
An incomplete kitchen must lack either a convection oven/stove or a kitchen sink.
An incomplete  bathroom must lack either a toilet or shower/bathtub.
The remaining kitchen or bathroom facilities nec- essary to serve the accessory residential unit must be provided within the primary dwelling unit.
The  applicant shall provide evidence that the sewage disposal needs of the additional accessory bedroom(s)  can be satisfied by the existing sewage service.
No separate meters for utility service shall be established  or provided for any accessory residential unit.
6.2  Maximum floor area.
Accessory residential units shall contain not more than five hundred   (500) gross square feet or twenty-five (25) percent of the total improved floor area of the primary residen- tial dwelling, whichever is less.
6.3  Leasing agreement prohibited.
No accessory residential unit shall be leased to a tenant  through any formal leasing agreement or contract.
Any reimbursement arrangements for use of the unit  or support services provided to the tenant shall be on an informal and incidental basis.
6.4  Contained within primary dwelling.
An accessory residential unit must be attached to (by  a common wall) or contained within the primary dwelling unit on a property.
No accessory structure or  outbuilding on the lot may be used or modified to serve as an accessory residential unit.
Not more than  one (1) exterior entrance to an accessory  residential unit shall be permitted.
6.5  Limit on number of units.
Where permitted, no more than one (1) accessory residential unit  shall be allowed per primary dwelling.
6.6  No change in character of structure.
An accessory residential unit shall be designed to cause  no apparent change in the exterior residential character or appearance of the primary dwelling unit.
6.7  Documentation of need.
Accessory residential units are intended to serve specific family or  household needs that would be better satisfied by the creation of a semi-independent living environ- ment.
Applicants who desire to construct an accessory residential unit shall submit a written statement  to the enforcement officer describing the need that will be served by the accessory residential unit.
44   Article IV: Special Use Provisions SECTION 7 - SIGN REGULATIONS   7.1  Purpose of Sign Regulations.
The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the con- struction, maintenance, and regulation of outdoor advertising within the City.
While Alexander City ac- knowledges the legitimate public need for business visibility, local businesses must also recognize the  legitimate public need for a beautiful and uncluttered community and the City’s legitimate need to en- sure safe traffic circulation on City streets.
Local experience within Anniston, Gadsden, Atlanta, and Bir- mingham generally supports the contention that excessive, competing signage along public streets can  create visual clutter, which makes it difficult for motorists to see traffic control and highway safety signs  and to quickly judge where entrances to adjoining businesses are located.
The City also has determined  that excessive, competing signage can divert motorist attention from the highway, which contributes  to traffic accidents.
The City also wishes to protect its established historic small city character and scale  from the appearance of cluttered and excessive signage.
Therefore, Alexander City has determined that  it is desirable to prescribe the manner of sign construction and to compel the use of safe materials; limit  the number, type, surface area, height, and location of signs; and require clean and sanitary maintenance  of signs in order to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the community.
Further,  these sign regulations are intended to lessen hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic; preserve prop- erty values; prevent unsightly and detrimental development which has a blighting influence upon the  community; and, in general, preserve the character and aesthetic quality of the various zones within the  City.

SECTION 8 - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS, ANTENNAS, AND SATELLITE DISHES   8.1  Purpose of Regulations.
The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the placement   and appearance of telecommunication towers, antennas, and satellite dishes under the Telecommunica- tions Act of 1996, where such control does not conflict with or unreasonably constrain the legitimate right  of businesses to exercise free trade.
Alexander City desires access to advanced technology to serve its  businesses and citizens, but not at the expense of the community’s overall appearance and public image.
Alexander City seeks to impose sensible controls on telecommunication facilities, in order to maintain  the aesthetic character and charm of the community and its neighborhoods against the insensitive and  uncontrolled proliferation and placement of steel lattice towers and other telecommunications facilities.
New telecommunications towers should not create a cluttered landscape or dominate the community’s  skyline as it is viewed from the primary highway entrances to Alexander City.
To that end, the City de- sires to partner with telecommunications firms to ensure expansion of the existing telecommunications  infrastructure that will provide effective advanced communications services throughout the City and  surrounding environs, commensurate with local needs, with a minimal visual impact on the character  and charm of the community, and without creating impediments to free competition among wireless  telecommunications providers seeking to serve the City.
These regulations have been developed by the  City to achieve the aforementioned objectives.

Examples of proper camouflaging include: designing a tower to resemble a tree,  designing a monopole to look like and function as a flag pole or freestanding sign support, hiding an  antenna within a church steeple, or any other effective means of disguising the appearance of a tow- er or antenna that may be appropriate for the setting in the area surrounding the proposed commu- nication facility site.
It shall be the burden of the applicant to document and prove that a proposed  communication facility cannot be effectively camouflaged, before approval of a non-camouflaged  structure may be permitted by the City.
In such instances, the applicant shall explore alternative  means of minimizing the visual impact of the antenna, such as installing it onto an existing telephone  pole, streetlight, or building rooftop, rather than erecting a new tower specifically for the proposed  antenna.
However, in no instance shall a non-camouflaged communication facility be approved for a  residential property.
E. Signs prohibited.
No signs or other forms of advertising, including signs displaying the name of the  owner or user of the tower or antenna, may be attached to or depicted on a communication facility,  unless the proposed facility is a new monopole specifically camouflaged and approved to serve as  a permitted freestanding sign support.
This prohibition shall not apply to any required warning or  private property posting signs.
F. Construction materials.
Where applicable building codes, technical codes, and federal regulations  permit flexibility in the choice of construction materials and where the selection of alternative con- struction materials will not compromise the structural integrity of the proposed communication facil- ity, proposed new towers and monopoles shall be constructed of materials that have a composition,  texture, and color that will most closely resemble structures and natural features that exist on and  adjoining the facility site.
G. Health Effects.
All proposed communication facilities shall comply with all applicable FCC regula- tions and requirements in effect to prevent detrimental health effects from the proposed commu- nication facilities.
Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the City cannot deny a request to  construct a communication facility on the grounds that its radio frequency or electromagnetic emis- sions would be harmful to the environment or the health of residents, if those emissions meet FCC  standards.
H. Interference with Existing Communication Facilities.
All proposed communication facilities shall  comply with all applicable FCC regulations and requirements in effect to prevent interference with  existing communication facilities serving the area.
I. Siting Requirements for Whip Antennas.
Whip antennas shall not be allowed on a wall mounted  antenna structure.
J. Co-location.
No new tower or monopole shall be erected on a proposed communication facility site  unless the applicant can document and prove that an existing co-location site is not available or is  not technically capable of serving the specific telecommunication need in the area of the proposed  site.
This co-location requirement may be waived by the City where the proposed antenna would  create an excessively cluttered appearance on the available co-location site (thereby drawing greater  visual attention to the existing antenna site or creating a more imposing obstruction to scenic views  and vistas from the area) and the proposed new antenna would be less visible or intrusive on the  surrounding area if effectively camouflaged on an alternate site.
K. Setback Requirements.
All proposed communication facilities and structures, including guys and  accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district in which  they will be sited.
However, all proposed tower compounds that will be located on a residential  property shall be subject to an additional setback from all property boundaries of the site equal to     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     57  Article IV: Special Use Provisions the height of the tower structure as measured from the finished ground level at the base or pad sur- face to the tallest point of the structure.
If the tower compound abuts a property with an existing or  approved (but not yet constructed or completed) residential use, the residential property setback re- quirement shall be satisfied for all property boundaries of the site that abut said existing or approved  residential uses.
L. Lighting.
Towers may not be artificially lighted, except where required to satisfy applicable FAA reg- ulations.
Lights for security and to assist in making emergency repairs may be installed on buildings  within the tower compound which contain equipment essential to the operation and maintenance  of the tower.
Such lights shall be shielded and directed in a downward direction from a height of not  more than ten (10) feet, and no such light may exceed a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) watts.
Such lights shall be located and directed so that they do not shine, reflect, or generate excessive glare  onto or toward any residential property or adjoining property upon which a residential use exists or  has been approved for construction.
M. Security Fence.
All communication facilities to be located within a proposed tower compound shall  be secured by the construction of an eight (8) foot high security fence or wall constructed, at a mini- mum, using chain link fencing.
N. Landscaping.
All proposed tower compounds must be surrounded by a landscaped buffer which  shall provide an effective year-round screen to a height of at least eight (8) feet upon planting in  order to screen views of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, residential properties, and  properties upon which a residential use exists or has been approved for construction.
The buffer shall  include a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet in depth located outside of the security fence or wall.
The landscaped strip shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, vines, and grown covers  which are capable of attaining, at maturity, a height as high as the security fence or wall and which  will enhance and screen the outward appearance of the security fence.
The use of native species of  plants and trees are encouraged to the extent that they will satisfy the requirement for adequate  year-round screening.
The applicant shall provide documentation to show what forms of vegetation  will be planted within the landscaped area and how the area will be effectively maintained to ensure  the long-term health of the plantings.
Such documentation shall include the name, mailing address,  and business telephone number of the party who shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair  of the communication facilities and any fences, walls, and landscaped buffer areas.
If the person or  party responsible for such maintenance and repair changes any time after approval has been issued,  the owner of the tower must provide the City’s Enforcement Officer with written notice of the new  party’s name, mailing address, and business telephone number and the date upon which the change  will become effective.
O. Communication Facility Siting Priorities.
When selecting sites within the City to locate proposed  communication facilities or tower compounds, priority shall be given to locations in non-residential  zoning districts.
Residential property sites shall be given the lowest possible consideration for new  sites.
P. Access and Parking.
A driveway and parking area with a surface appropriate for the intensity of  use shall be provided for each proposed tower compound to provide adequate access to the tower  compound for the maintenance and repair of the communication facilities and for vehicle providing  emergency services.
Subject to the approval of the City Council and to an appropriate agreement  with the owner thereof, access and parking for the tower compound may be provided on an adjoin- ing property or along one or more public streets adjoining the tower compound.
8.5  Levels of Review and Approval.
In recognition of the high standards for proposed communi- cation facilities established by this Ordinance, allowances have been made for an efficient and, in certain  instances, expedited review process, where the applicant can demonstrate that a good faith effort to  embrace and comply with the spirit and intent of these guidelines has been made in the design of the  proposal.
The three levels of review and approval and the types of projects that can be considered within     58   Article IV: Special Use Provisions each level are as follows:  A.
Review and Approval by Enforcement Officer.
The following types of communication facilities shall   be reviewed and approved by the Enforcement Officer without the need for a public hearing, provid- ed the proposed improvements fully complies with all requirements specified in Section 8.4 of this  Article:  1.
Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be co-located on an existing ap-  proved or registered pre-existing tower, as long as the proposed antenna(s) will not protrude at  any point from the exterior surface of said tower by a distance of more than four (4) feet and the  tower will contain no more than five (5) antennas if the application is approved.
In addition, the  supporting equipment for the proposed antenna(s) shall not require the construction of any new  freestanding structures on the tower compound.
2.
Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be sited in an existing structure that  fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance (not a non-conforming struc- ture) and where, after installation, the antenna and all supporting equipment will be completely  enclosed by the exterior walls of the structure or completely screened from public view at any  point on the land within two (2) thousand feet of the proposed antenna.
An example of such a  scenario would be the placement of an antenna within the steeple of a church or the dome of  a farm silo.
The addition of the antenna and supporting equipment to the existing conforming  structure shall not require the construction of an addition to house the communication facilities.
However, interior modifications to the structure may be permitted as part of the approval by the  Enforcement Officer.
B.
Review and Approval Exclusively by City Council.
The City Council shall have the authority to re- view and approve the following specific types of communication facilities and tower compounds,  subject to the conduct of a public hearing, but without the need for a formal recommendation from  the Planning Commission: 1.
Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be installed on a co-location site   that does not fall within the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer, as specified in Sub- paragraph A.
1. of this Section.
2.
Any new antenna (not including a tower) that will be attached to an existing structure that fully  conforms with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance (not a non-conforming structure),  but that would not otherwise fall within the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer as  specified in Subparagraph A.
2. of this Section.
3.
Any new monopole not greater than thirty (30) feet in height and located in a non-residential  zoning district that is camouflaged or disguised in such a way that it cannot be immediately rec- ognized as an antenna support.
4.
Any new antenna or tower to be located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by  the City of Alexander City and located within a non-residential zoning district.
C. Review and Approval by City Council Upon Recommendation From Planning Commission.
All  applications not subject to review and approval by the Enforcement Officer in accordance with Sub- paragraph A of this Section or review and approval exclusively by the City Council in accordance with  Subparagraph B of this Section shall be subject to review and public hearings by both the Planning  Commission and the City Council.
The Planning Commission shall review the application and issue a  recommendation for approval or denial to the City Council.
Final review and approval or denial of the  application shall be issued exclusively by the City Council.
8.6  Approval Procedures.
Review and approval of an application shall be conducted in accor- dance with the following procedures.
A. Pre-Application Consultation.
Any applicant seeking to develop communication facilities or tower  compounds that fall within the jurisdiction of these regulations may request an informal  consultation     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     59  Article IV: Special Use Provisions with the Enforcement Officer and/or Building Inspector prior to the preparation and submission of a  formal application.
The purpose of this voluntary consultation shall be to answer specific questions  about the process or applicable design requirements, discuss possible camouflaging or co-location  options, or discuss application format options and/or potential supporting documentation submis- sion needs.
Any such consultation discussions must occur before a formal application is submitted to  the City, shall be non-binding on the applicant and the City, and shall not in any way constitute or be  interpreted to constitute a decision to approve or deny an application.
B.
Receipt of Application.
All required applications shall be submitted to the Enforcement Officer.
Upon submission, the Enforcement Officer shall determine that the application contains all submis- sion requirements specified in Section 8.7 of this Article and is, therefore, complete.
No incomplete  application shall be received by the City for review and approval.
Once the Enforcement Officer de- termines the application is complete, the application shall be determined to have been received by  the City on that date.
C. Enforcement Officer Review.
The Enforcement Officer and/or Building Official shall review a com- plete application within thirty-one (31) days of the date of receipt.
At the end of that review, the  Enforcement Officer shall issue approval or denial for those aspects of the application that fall within  the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer, as specified in Section 8.5, Subparagraph A of  this Article.
If the application or any part of the application is denied, the Enforcement Officer shall  provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining the specific findings of fact used by  the City as the basis of the denial.
Such denial shall be based on the unwillingness of the applicant  to comply with the requirements of the regulations and/or the failure of the application to satisfy  specific basic requirements and design considerations outlined in Section 8.4 of these regulations.
If  the Enforcement Officer fails to render a decision on the application within the required thirty-one  (31) days, then aspects of the application subject to review and approval by the Enforcement Officer  shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further consideration by the City.
However,  the City Council may grant an extension to the thirty-one (31) day deadline not to exceed an addi- tional thirty-one (31) days, due to extended illness or absence of the Enforcement Officer during the  required review and approval period or the submission of an application that is too large or extensive  to be reviewed by existing staff resources within the prescribed time frame.
On the date that the  Enforcement Officer’s review period ends, any remaining portions of the application not subject to  approval or denial by the Enforcement Officer shall be submitted to the City Council and/or Planning  Commission for action, as may be applicable.
The forwarded application shall be accompanied by a  written report from the Enforcement Officer regarding his/her assessment of the proposed commu- nication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applicable requirements specified in Section 8.4  of this Article.
D. Planning Commission and City Council Review.
All applications or portions of applications requir- ing review and approval of the City Council and/or Planning Commission in accordance with Section  8.5, Subparagraphs B or C of this Article shall follow the same general guidelines as for an amend- ment to this Ordinance as specified in Article VIII (Amendments) of this Ordinance, with the specific  exception that Planning Commission review shall not be required for applications that may be ap- proved exclusively by the City Council, in accordance with Section 8.5, Subparagraph B of this Article.
E. Public Hearing.
The City Council and, if necessary, Planning Commission shall each conduct one  public hearing on the application at the earliest regular meeting date that will satisfy the public hear- ing notice requirements following the date of submission by the Enforcement Officer.
The required  public hearing shall be noticed in the same manner prescribed in the applicable Sections of Article  VIII of this Ordinance (Section 4 for the Planning Commission and Section 5 for the City Council).
At  the hearing, the presiding body shall entertain a report from the Enforcement Officer regarding his/ her assessment of the proposed communication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applica- ble requirements specified in Section 8.4 of this Article.
A written copy of the Enforcement Officer’s  report shall be incorporated into the minutes of the public hearing, along with a written synopsis of     60   Article IV: Special Use Provisions all public comments received and an attendance sheet identifying the names and mailing addresses  of every person who attended the public hearing.
F. Decision.
The presiding body shall render a decision on the application within thirty-one (31) days  from the date that the public hearing is closed.
For the Planning Commission, such decision shall  be in the form of a written recommendation, along with a list of the findings of fact upon which the  recommendation was based, to the City Council for final action.
If the Planning Commission fails to  render a formal recommendation on the application within the required thirty-one (31) days, then  the application shall be transmitted to the City Council for final decision with an automatic or implied  recommendation of approval.
If the City Council fails to render a decision on the application within  the required thirty-one (31) days, then the application shall be deemed to be automatically approved  without further consideration by the City.
If the application or any part of the application is denied,  the City Council shall provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining the specific find- ings of fact used by the City Council as the basis of the denial.
Such denial shall be based on the  unwillingness of the applicant to comply with the requirements of the regulations or specific basic  requirements and design considerations outlined in Section 8.4 of these regulations that the applica- tion fails to satisfy.
8.7  Submission Requirements.
All applications to construct communication facilities that fall  within the jurisdiction of these regulations shall provide adequate documentation to demonstrate com- pliance with all applicable basic requirements and design considerations specified in Section 8.4 of these  regulations.
A single application may include any number of proposed tower compounds that will be  located within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, even though some of the proposed tower compounds  may be subject to expedited review procedures as provided in Section 8.5 of this Article.
Where an ap- plication includes tower compounds subject to different levels of review, the application may be divided  into sections for each review category, within which all necessary supporting information for each pro- posed tower compound shall be provided.
Whenever portions of an application have been approved or  denied through an expedited review process, that information and any terms of said approval or denial  shall be noted and considered in the subsequent review procedures for the remaining portions of the  application.
The Enforcement Officer shall determine the number of application copies that must be sub- mitted by the applicant, based on the number of parties who must review the application.
One (1) copy  of the application shall be required for each of the following review agents, as may be required: the En- forcement Officer, Building Inspector (if such person is not the Enforcement Officer), Planning Commis- sion (as a body), and the City Council (as a body).
At a minimum, each required application shall contain  the following:  A.
A completed zoning permit application form, including the required application fee.
B.
A site plan of the tower compound, prepared by a surveyor, at a scale not less than one (1) inch to   fifty (50) feet, showing the location, street address, tax parcel identification number, and dimensions  of the parcel of land that will contain the tower compound, the location of all required setback lines,   driveways, parking areas, buffers, fencing, landscaping, stormwater management improvements, fuel  tanks (both above and below ground), and structures that exist or will be constructed on the prop- erty.
If the property upon which a proposed tower compound will be located exceeds one hundred  (100) acres in size, then the scale of the site plan shall be increased to one (1) inch to one hundred  (100) feet, or the Enforcement Officer may grant authority to the applicant to limit the site plan cov- erage to a specified area around the proposed tower compound.
C. Written proof of ownership of the proposed tower compound or authorization to use it.
D. A written report including a description of the proposed tower or antenna with the technical reasons   for its design, a certificate from the project engineer documenting  the structural integrity of the  tower or antenna support for its proposed use including any co-located communication facilities that  may already exist at the site, and an affidavit signed by the owner of the proposed communication fa-    City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     61  Article IV: Special Use Provisions cilities and the project engineer attesting compliance of the proposed communication facilities with  all applicable FCC requirements with regard to any potential detrimental health effects that could be  generated by the proposed facilities.
E. A silhouette and elevation view of the proposed tower (or the existing tower, if the applicant is seek- ing permission to install an antenna on an existing tower) and all other communication facilities, and  the tower compound, describing colors and materials to be used for the communication facilities  and any security fence, decorative fence, and decorative wall.
The configuration of proposed antenna  arrays must be shown on the silhouette.
The proposed location of future, additional antenna arrays  must be shown on the silhouette by dashed lines.
The elevation view shall portray the general con- text and compatibility of the proposed facilities with respect to surrounding structures and natural  features.
F. Copies of any proposed easements, where applicable to the project.
G. Documentation of the frequency band and wattage of the proposed communication facilities.
H. For each new monopole, tower, or antenna that is not otherwise located on a co-location site, a writ-  ten report documenting the attempts made by the applicant to secure a suitable co-location site  both within the city and in the adjoining unincorporated areas and any supporting technical reasons  supporting the need for a new independent site.
8.8  Inspection/Fee.
To determine whether tower compounds are in compliance with the require- ments of this Ordinance, the City shall make, or have made on its behalf, an annual inspection of the  communication facilities on each tower compound and the walls, fences, and landscaping around each  tower compound, for which an annual inspection fee of $200.00 shall be imposed.
If more than one an- tenna is located on a tower, the annual inspection fee shall be $300.00.
The fee shall be due on January  1 of each year and shall be delinquent if not paid by January 31 of such year.
To help defray the cost of  collecting delinquent fees, an additional fee, in the amount equal to ten (10) percent of the fee shall be  payable for each month, or portion of a month, after January in which the fee remains unpaid.
If the fee  is not paid within three (3) months of its due date, the City may withdraw its permission for the location  of communication facilities on the tower compound, in which event, all communication facilities must  be removed from the tower compound within three (3) months of the day on which the owner or owners  of the tower receive notice of such withdrawal of permission.
The fee shall be payable by, and shall be  the responsibility of the owner or owners of the tower, even if additional antennas located on the tower  are owned by other parties.
If there is more than one owner of the tower, each owner shall be jointly  and severally liable for the entire amount of the fee and any additional fees due because of delinquency  in payment.
Any inspection conducted in accordance with these regulations shall not be relate to the  safety or structural soundness of the communication facilities or tower.
The purpose of the inspection  shall be limited to determining whether such communication facilities and tower compound are in com- pliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Any violation of the provisions of the Ordinance that are  discovered through said inspection shall be processed and resolved in accordance with the procedures  specified in Article VI, Section 4 of this Ordinance.
8.9  Removal of Obsolete Towers.
Any tower that is no longer serving an active communication  use shall be removed at the owner’s expense.
The owner shall provide the Enforcement Officer with  a copy of the notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations and remove the tower and all associated  communication facilities from the site within three (3) months from the date that all operations ceased.
Where a tower serves as a co-location site, this provision shall not apply until all active users cease oper- ation.
If the owner of the tower fails to remove the tower as required, the responsibility for removal shall  then apply to the owner of the land upon which the obsolete tower is located.
Once the responsibility for  removal has shifted to the property owner, the property owner shall remove the obsolete tower within  one (1) month of the date that tower owner’s removal deadline lapsed.
If neither the owner of the tower  nor the owner of the land removes the obsolete tower within the time prescribed herein, the City may,     62   Article IV: Special Use Provisions but shall not be obligated to, remove the obsolete tower.
If the City removes the obsolete tower, it shall  be entitled to recover the cost of removal from the owner of the tower and/or the owner of the land  upon which the tower is located.
8.10  Satellite Dishes.
All satellite dishes exceeding one (1) meter in diameter shall be considered  structures required to be installed in accordance with all applicable provisions of this Ordinance, the  Standard Building Code, and any other applicable regulations enforced by the City of Alexander City.
All  such dishes shall be located in the rear yard of the property, and shall be set back from all property lines  a distance equal to the height of the dish.
8.11  Appeals.
All appeals from a decision by the Enforcement Officer or City Council shall be to the  Circuit Court or FCC as prescribed by the Telecommunication Act of 1996.
8.12 Section 6409(a) of the Federal Communications Commission Report.
Nothing in this sec- tion shall be construed to conflict with Section 6409(a) of the Federal Communications Commission Re- port and Order of 2014, which states that a local government may not deny, and shall approve, any  eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not  substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.
The term “eligible facilities  request” means any request or modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that involves col- location of new transmission equipment, removal of transmission equipment, or replacement of trans- mission equipment.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve the FCC from the requirements of the National  Historic Preservation Act or the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
Substantial change occurs when the proposed eligible facilities request:   A.
Increases the height more than:  1.
Ten (10) percent or one additional antenna array not more than twenty (20) feet higher for towers  on private property, or   2.
Ten (10) percent or ten (10) feet (whichever is greater) for towers in the public rights-of-way and  all base stations; or  B.
Increases the width more than: 1.
Twenty (20) feet or the tower width at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater) for   towers on private property, or 2.
Six (6) feet for towers in the public rights-of-way and all base stations; or  C. Involves any excavation outside either: 1.
The lease or license area on private property, or 2.
The proximity to the ground-mounted equipment in the ROW; or  D. Defeats the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station; or E. Violates a prior condition of approval that does not conflict with the FCC’s standards for a substantial   change.
SECTION 9 -TEMPORARY USE BUILDINGS AND OFFICES   Nothing is this ordinance shall be constructed to prohibit the use of a trailer for a temporary construction  office in accordance with the building code of the City of Alexander City, nor shall this ordinance be deemed  to prohibit the parking of only one unoccupied camper-trailer, not exceeding ten (10) feet in width and thir- ty-five (35) feet in length, in an accessory private garage building or in a rear yard of any district, so long as  no living quarters are maintained and no business is practiced in such camper-trailer while it is so stored or     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     63  Article IV: Special Use Provisions parked.
SECTION 10 - CHILD CARE CENTER REQUIREMENTS   All child care facilities, whether conducted within a home or in a nonresidential building, shall be established  in compliance with the following requirements.
10.1  In-Home Child Care Facilities.
Any in-home child care facility that was lawfully established  and licensed by the State of Alabama prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall be allowed to re- main in operation without further approval from the City (subject to any conditions imposed by the Plan- ning Commission at the time of approval).
Any new in-home child care facility (serving five [5] or fewer  children) will only be permitted by the Board of Adjustment as a Special Exception within a residential  zone (RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3M, and MHP) subject to the applicable requirements of a home occupation, as  specified in Article IV, Section 4 of this ordinance, and subject to any additional mitigating conditions that  the Board of Adjustment is authorized to impose under Article VII, Section 5.2 of this ordinance.
No signs  advertising an in-home child care facility shall be located on the property.
An in-home child care facility  shall be classified as a residential based facility and must satisfy all applicable requirements imposed by  the State of Alabama Department of Human Resources.
10.2  Non-Residential Child Care Centers.
Child care centers serving six (6) or more children shall  not be allowed in any residential zone or residential use building.
All such child care centers shall fully  comply with all requirements of the building code for an educational occupancy.
Architectural plans also  may be required to document compliance.
Any child care center that was lawfully established prior to  the effective date of this ordinance, but does not comply with the requirements specified herein, shall  be classified as a pre-existing, nonconforming use, subject to the requirements contained in Article IV,  Section 1 of this ordinance.
Such uses shall be allowed to continue operation as previously permitted,  only as long as the facility does not increase the number of children it serves and it does not expand the  area of the facility (both indoors and outdoors) dedicated to child care services.
Any such change in the  intensity of use shall require the issuance of a new zoning permit, and the facility shall fully comply with  all requirements of this ordinance.
SECTION 11 - CEMETERIES   Within all zoning districts that cemeteries are permitted, the following requirements shall apply:   11.1  The site proposed for a cemetery shall not interfere with the development of a system of streets  classified as collector or higher in the vicinity of such site.
In addition, such site shall have direct access to  a major street.

64   Article IV: Special Use Provisions SECTION 12 - STANDARDS FOR TOWNHOUSES, CONDOMINIUMS, AND GARDEN HOMES   12.1  Townhouses and Condominiums.
The design, review, and approval of Townhouse or Condo- minium development projects within any regular zoning district that such uses may be permitted, shall  be governed by this guidelines and requirements contained in this section.
A.
Statement of intent.
The purpose of this Section is to establish special standards for the design and  review of development projects containing Townhouse and Condominium dwellings.
It is expect- ed that Townhouse and Condominium developments will offer a higher standard of amenity than  a traditional residential subdivision to compensate for the higher residential density opportunities  afforded by these special development standards.
In addition, the development design flexibility  created by these standards should be used to protect sensitive natural features within or adjacent to  the development site, such as rivers and streams, lakes or lake shoreline, rare or endangered species  colonies or habitats, or large stands or tracts of mature trees or forest areas.
Such natural features or  resources would be difficult to protect under traditional subdivision practices.
Although architectural  design of individual buildings is not specifically regulated by this Ordinance, the City expects devel- opers of Townhouse and Condominium projects to design buildings and utilize exterior materials  and color schemes that will help the project blend with or complement the predominant architec- tural style of the surrounding neighborhood and to minimize the appearance and intrusion of the  higher permitted residential densities on the natural environment, neighboring properties, and the  overall setting of the project.
B.
Basic Development Requirements for all Townhouses and Condominiums.
The following basic  design requirements and dimensional standards shall be incorporated into each Townhouse and  Condominium development:  1.
Minimum development site area for Townhouse and Condominium projects.
Each lot or   development site that will be designed to accommodate Townhouse or Condominium dwelling  units and buildings shall contain not less than five (5) acres within an RR, Reserve Residential Zone  or R-1, Low Density Residential Zone and not less than two and one half (2.5) acres in any other  permitted zoning district.
At least seventy-five (75) percent of the land area contained within the  entire development site shall consist of developable land area.
2.
Maximum number of dwelling units.
The maximum number of Townhouse and/or Condomini- um dwelling units that may be constructed on any given acre of land contained with the de- velopment site shall not exceed the number specified below, unless approved by the Planning  Commission in accordance with the density bonus provisions of Section 13.1, Subparagraph C:  RR, Reserve Residential Zone: Ten (10) units.
R-1, Low Density Residential Zone: Twelve (12) units.
All other zones:     Eighteen (18) units.
3.
Maximum and minimum number of dwelling units allowed in a single building.
No town- house or condominium building shall contain fewer than four (4) nor more than twelve (12) inde- pendent dwelling units.
4.
Maximum percentage of development site covered by impervious surfaces.
The maximum  percentage of an entire development site that may be covered by impervious surfaces at project  build-out shall not exceed fifty (50) percent in the RR or R-1 zone or sixty (60) percent in all other  zoning districts, unless approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with the density  bonus provisions of Section 13.1, Subparagraph C.   5.
Common lands required.
All areas of Townhouse or Condominium development site that are  not divided into Townhouse lots, condominium buildings, or dedicated public street rights-of way  shall be dedicated for development and perpetual maintenance as common lands, subject to the  requirements contained in Article IV, Section 10 of this Ordinance.
Common lands may be used  for parking, driveways, recreation, stormwater management, and buffers.

Where a townhouse or condominium development contains sixty (60) or more  dwelling units, the required resident manager unit may be improved and utilized as an adminis- trative office for the development.
C. Review and approval.
Since both Townhouse and Condominium developments result in the subdi- vision of land into parcels or units for sale or transfer of ownership, they must be approved as subdi- visions.
Therefore, all Townhouse and Condominium developments must be reviewed and approved  by the Planning Commission in accordance with the review and approval procedures of the Alex- ander City Subdivision Regulations, prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.
To the extent that the  development standards and/or review considerations of this Section conflict with the corresponding  requirements of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations (as they may be applied to Townhouse or  Condominium projects), the requirements contained in this Ordinance shall supercede and govern.
All other procedures and requirements of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations shall apply.
During its review of a Townhouse or Condominium development, the Planning Commission shall  evaluate the following review considerations, and may issue such conditions of approval as may be  reasonably necessary to correct specific design deficiencies under these considerations.\ 1.
The consistency of the proposed development scheme with the Comprehensive Plan.
2.
The traffic impacts of the proposed development on adjoining public streets in terms of access   and circulation and congestion on neighborhood streets.
3.
The extent to which the layout and design of the development will retain and protect sensitive   and enhancing natural features of the site that would otherwise be lost under a traditional sub- division design.
4.
The extent to which the architectural design and style of the buildings will complement the pre- dominant architectural styles present in the surrounding neighborhood.
All townhouse and con- dominium buildings within a development should be designed and/or painted to be aestheti- cally compatible with each other.
Where the building exteriors or trim are to be painted, earth  tones shall be preferred.
To the greatest extent feasible, all townhouse and condominium build- ings should be designed to be compatible with or reflective of the predominant architectural  style(s) represented in the neighborhood surrounding the development site (if the neighborhood  is clearly characterized by a particular architectural style).
5.
The extent to which the proposed buildings will be designed and oriented to take advantage of  scenic views and or to maximize solar access.
6.
The extent to which the higher development densities on the site are visually screened from any  adjoining properties developed for traditional single family detached homes.
7.
The extent to which recreational improvements and amenities, designed to serve the target mar- ket population for the project, will be incorporated into the common open space within the de- velopment.
As an additional incentive to advance the provision of recreational improvements  within a Townhouse or Condominium development, the Planning Commission may authorize the  developer to construct an additional four (4) dwelling units or lots per acre over and above the  maximum number of units allowed in Subparagraph B above and an increase of not more than     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     67  Article IV: Special Use Provisions twenty (20) percent in the maximum percentage of impervious surfaces for Townhouse develop- ments or thirty (30) percent for Condominium developments in exchange for the provision of any  two of the following recreational amenities, as may be appropriate for the specific development:  a.
An outdoor, in-ground, Olympic-size swimming pool with a diving platform.

12.2  Garden Home Subdivisions.
For the purposes of this Ordinance, a Garden Home shall be  defined as a single or two family detached dwelling unit (excluding manufactured homes) designed and  sited on a lot to maximize rear yard or rear and side yard access and utility, through the construction of an  exterior patio or first floor deck, rear patio doors, large rear and/or side windows, and the incorporation  of intensive ornamental landscaping (which may include ornamental fencing) surrounding the exterior  patio/deck to enhance rear/side yard privacy and visual appeal.
Garden homes are designed to create  a high value single family residential environment in a high density setting.
All garden home develop- ments shall comply with the following requirements:  A.
Residential dwelling types permitted.
Single family dwellings, excluding manufactured homes.
B. Infrastructure requirements.
All garden homes shall be served by municipal water, sewer, and gas.
C. Siting.
Garden home structures shall be sited as close as possible to the front setback line and one of   the side yard setback lines to maximize utility of the remaining rear and opposing side yard for patio/ garden development.
Such units may be designed as a zero lot line development in accordance with  the provisions of Article IV, Section 14 of this Ordinance.
D. Accessory structures.
No accessory structures shall be permitted on a garden home lot.
Exterior stor- age units and garages must be attached to the dwelling unit.
E. Landscaping.

F. Windows.
Windows within garden homes shall be designed to favor (in terms of size, number, or  both) views of the landscaped rear and/or side yards of the property.
G. Special infill development incentives for garden home subdivisions.
The City of Alexander City desires  to encourage high quality infill residential development within the developed core of the City.
Infill  development promotes efficient growth by utilizing existing infrastructure and breathing new life  into established neighborhoods, thereby stabilizing property values and strengthening established  neighborhoods.
To help encourage quality infill residential development, the City has developed the  following development incentives or intensity bonuses for any garden home subdivision in areas of  the City identified by the Alexander City Comprehensive Plan as “potential infill residential develop- ment sites.”  These areas have been identified by the Planning Commission as desired locations for the  development or redevelopment of high-value urban residential environments, where supporting in- frastructure and community services are available and accessible.
Any applicant that either develops  or rezones and develops an area identified in the Comprehensive Plan as a “potential infill residential  development site” in accordance with the garden home subdivision provisions of this Ordinance,  shall be entitled to develop the site in accordance with the modified dimensional requirements listed     68   Article IV: Special Use Provisions below.
All other dimensional requirements imposed by the applicable zoning district that are not  otherwise modified by the standards listed below shall be applied as specified in that district.
1.

In no instance shall a reduced side yard on one lot abut a reduced side yard on an  adjoining lot.
One exterior wall of each dwelling unit constructed on a zero lot line property shall be sited  along the reduced side yard setback.
13.6  Maintenance easement required.
For each zero lot line property, a permanently dedicated  four (4) foot wide maintenance easement shall be imposed on the side yard of the adjoining property  that abuts a zero side yard, to allow the zero lot line property owner adequate access to the neighboring     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     69  Article IV: Special Use Provisions property to maintain the exterior wall of the dwelling along the zero lot line.
The easement shall prohibit  the construction of any fence, landscaping, or other access obstruction with the required maintenance  easement.

70   Article V: Zoning District Requirements ARTICLE V: ZONING DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS   SECTION 1 - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS   For the purpose of this Ordinance, the City of Alexander City is hereby divided into the type of districts desig- nated as follows:   1.1  Regular Districts   RR  Reserve Residential District    R-1  Low Density Residential District    R-2  Medium Density Residential District    R-3  High Density Residential District    R-3M  High Density Residential Manufactured Home District    MHP  Manufactured Home Park District    B-1  Neighborhood Business District    B-2  General Business District    B-3  Central Business District    I-1  Light Industry District    I-2  Heavy Industry District    PO Parks and Open Space District  1.2  Special Districts     FH  Flood Hazard District    PD  Planned Development District    CAB Central Alabama Business Park District   LS Lee Street Overlay District    SECTION 2 - ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES  The boundaries of the various zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the Zoning Map.
The Zon- ing Map includes a base map which identifies the location of the regular districts and an overlay to the base  map which outlines the boundaries of the special districts.
The Zoning Map and all explanatory matter there- on accompany and are hereby made a part of this Ordinance by reference.
Official copies of the Zoning Map  shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk.
SECTION 3 - INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps, the following rules shall  apply:  3.1  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following jurisdictional limits or platted lot  lines or other property lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
3.2  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or rail- roads, such boundaries shall be construed to follow the center lines of such streets, alleys, rights-of-way,  or railroads.
3.3  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following shorelines of lakes or ponds, such  boundaries shall be construed to follow the mean high water lines of such lakes or ponds.
In the event of  a change in the mean high waterline, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the actual mean     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     71  Article V: Zoning District Requirements high waterline.
3.4  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following streams, rivers, or other perennial  water courses, such boundaries shall be construed to follow the centerline of such waterways as deter- mined by the mean high water mark along opposing banks.
In the event of a natural change in the loca- tion of such waterways, the district boundary shall be construed as moving with the centerline.
3.5  Where boundaries are indicated as being separate from but approximately parallel to any fea- tures listed in Subparagraphs 3.1 through 3.4 of this Section, such boundaries shall be construed as being  parallel to and at such distance as indicated on the Zoning Map.
If no distance is given, such dimension  shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
3.6  Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the district requirements for  the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such  extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.
3.7  Where a public road, street, or alley shown on the Zoning Map is officially vacated or aban- doned, the regulations applicable to the property to which the right-of-way reverts shall apply to the  vacated or abandoned road, street, or alley.
3.8  In case any further uncertainty exists, the Board of Adjustment shall determine the location of  boundaries.
The Board of Adjustment may also cause to be prepared sectional maps of any part of the  City which will interpret the exact location of the district boundaries, following the guidelines contained  in the preceding paragraphs.
SECTION 4 - INTERPRETATION OF USES   Where doubt exists as to whether a new or previously unclassified use is similar in nature to the permitted  uses identified in this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall approve or deny the location of the unclas- sified use in question.
In making such a determination, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the extent to  which the proposed use is consistent with the intent of the zoning district and determine the specific permit- ted use within the zoning district that is most similar in impact and characteristics to the proposed new use.
However, in no instance shall the Board of Adjustment interpret a proposed use as being permitted in one  district, when the use is more similar in impact and characteristics to a use permitted in another district.
The  following procedures to establish consistency of unclassified uses shall be observed.
4.1  Determination by Board of Adjustment.
If compatible with the existing zoning district in- tent, the unclassified use shall be permitted by special exception upon approval of and subject to the  conditions set by the Board of Adjustment.
Such conditions of approval shall be established to prevent  undue impacts of the new use on surrounding uses, and shall be limited to:  A.
Special setback requirements (to alleviate potential use conflicts, to provide safe isolation distances,  or to facilitate traffic access and mobility);   B.
Special buffer, landscaping, or fencing requirements (to screen potentially conflicting uses);  C. Special lighting or light shielding requirements (to prevent excessive glare on neighboring proper-  ties);  D. Special parking requirements (to address special traffic or parking needs);  E. Special limitations on signage (to enhance or soften the appearance of the proposed use);  F. Special limitations on traffic access points to the property (to prevent traffic congestion and promote   proper traffic circulation);     72   Article V: Zoning District Requirements G. Special traffic connection requirements between the property to be developed and adjoining prop-  erties (to help improve internal traffic circulation and to mitigate turning movement impacts on ad- joining highways);   H. Special restrictions on operating hours (to reduce potential use and noise conflicts);  I.
Special soundproofing requirements (to prevent potential noise impacts); and  J.
Special stormwater management requirements (to prevent excessive flooding or erosion impacts   and/or to protect affected water resources).
4.2  Rezoning required.
If the unclassified use is deemed to be incompatible with the existing zon- ing district intent, the Enforcement Officer shall recommend the most appropriate district classification  and shall require the property in question to be rezoned before the proposed use can be conducted on  the property.
In addition, the unclassified use shall be permitted by special exception in the district to  which the property was rezoned, upon approval of and subject to the conditions set by the Board of Ad- justment.
4.3  Amendment of permitted uses.
Following the final action on the unclassified use, as Sections  4.1 or 4.2 may require, the Planning Commission shall initiate an amendment to this Ordinance to add  the newly permitted use to the list of permitted uses or uses allowed by right or by special exception  (whichever may be deemed appropriate) in the applicable zoning district(s).
SECTION 5 - RR: RESERVE RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT  5.1  District Intent.
Within Alexander City, extensive rural areas exist on the outskirts of the es- tablished neighborhoods and urbanized areas.
These rural areas are characterized by a mix of open  space uses, including small farms and forested lands, and low intensity developed uses.
Where munic- ipal infrastructure has been extended into these areas, pockets of suburban residential development  have emerged.
However, where minimal infrastructure is available, development intensities are gen- erally constrained by natural resources and constraints.
The primary purpose of this district is to allow  existing rural land use patterns, including agriculture and forestry, to continue until the City extends the  municipal infrastructure necessary to support more intensive development.
In areas where such infra- structure is provided, this district shall afford opportunities for low density residential development to  emerge, thereby allowing opportunities for the managed growth and expansion of the City.
To that end,  this district shall act as a reserve district to maintain existing rural land uses until such time as the City  is prepared for expansion.
Minimum standards for all uses shall be imposed to ensure compatibility of  uses within the context of a low intensity pattern of mixed uses.
These standards should promote low  intensity development patterns, consistent with the availability of municipal infrastructure, to help pro- tect existing natural resources and to minimize the impact of future growth on the municipal tax base,  thereby avoiding scattered and premature development.
5.2  Permitted Uses.
The following uses shall be permitted in the RR - Reserve Residential Zoning  District.
A.
Single family detached dwellings.
B.

Within floodplain areas, special land use restrictions are desired to: minimize  human exposure to flood hazards, prevent excessive pollution or contamination of surface water re- sources and flooded properties during floods,  provide maximum transmission and absorption of flood  waters by restricting the intensity of impervious surfaces and man-made obstructions within floodplains,  ensure that structures built within floodplains are properly floodproofed, to minimize private investment  losses due to flooding, and ensure the City’s continued participation in the National Flood Insurance  Program.
The purpose of this “overlay zone” is to impose special development standards and restrictions  in areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as subject to special flood hazard to  serve the aforementioned objectives.
An “overlay zone” imposes special development requirements and  restrictions in addition to the provisions of the underlying regular zoning district.
Where the require- ments of this district conflict with the requirements of an underlying regular zoning district or with other  applicable ordinances and regulations, the more restrictive requirements shall be followed.
All land use  and development activities on lands within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone shall also comply with all  requirements of the City of Alexander City Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.
18.2  Boundaries.
The boundaries of the Flood Hazard Area Zone shall encompass all areas of Alex- ander City lying within a Special Flood Hazard Area or 100-year floodplain, as shown on the latest pub- lished Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map for the subject property, prepared for  the National Flood Insurance Program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

SECTION 19 - PD: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT   19.1  District Intent.
The purpose of the PD - Planned Development district is to encourage the de- velopment of innovative and creative land use designs in a mixed use environment.
The district is intend- ed to allow the unified planning and development of large tracts of land suitable in location, area, and  character for the uses and structure proposed.
A mix of uses and housing types is encouraged, provided  that the proposed project is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the land uses proposed along  the external boundaries of the development site will be compatible in intensity, character, and design  with the neighboring uses.
19.2  Permitted Uses.
Any uses allowed in the RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, and B-1 zoning districts shall be  permitted, provided that the uses are laid out and buffered to minimize potential noise, traffic, and aes- thetic conflicts and the overall development scheme is consistent with the goals, objectives, and future  land use map contained in the Comprehensive Plan.
Proposed land uses along the boundaries of the  development site shall be compatible in intensity, character, and design with the land uses allowed in the  immediately adjoining regular zoning district(s).
All proposed land uses shall be shown and designated  clearly on the master plan of the development.

Where any information required by Subparagraph A of  this Section to be included in the master plan of development would also be required to be included  in a required preliminary plat, reference on the preliminary plat to the specific portions or pages of  the master plan of development containing said information shall be sufficient to satisfy the corre- sponding preliminary plat content requirements of the Subdivision Regulations.
No permit of any  type shall be issued for any use, activity, building, or site improvement that is not in accordance with  the approved and recorded master plan of development.
C. The master plan of development for a tract may be amended at any time by the City Council, upon  the recommendation of the Planning Commission, provided a notice is given and a public hearing  held thereon in the same manner as for the original approval of the change of zoning for the subject  tract to a PD zoning district classification.
D. Landscaping and open space shall be essential part of the master plan.
At least twenty-five (25)  percent of the gross area shall be dedicated to open space/recreational uses (such as landscaping,  bike paths, walkways [with or without exercise stations], swimming areas, and recreational courts).
At least half of the required open space area shall consist of developable land area.

The City of Alexander City may deny a proposed PD master plan or  require phasing of the project as may be needed to avoid public facility capacity shortfalls caused by  a premature development project.
Each PD master plan shall include letters from the Superintendent  of Education, the Fire Chief, the Police Chief, the Street/Sanitation Superintendent, and the Parks and  Recreation Director confirming that they have considered the scale of the proposed development  and have determined that it will not exceed the capacity of the specific public facilities and services  within their authority to serve the needs of the proposed development and the community at large.
Where such finding cannot be made by the aforementioned officials, the letter shall state, to the best  of the official’s knowledge, the nature of any potential infrastructure or service deficiencies and the  prospective date by which the City can address the deficiencies, if specific improvements have been  planned or envisioned.
H. Every effort shall be made to maximize energy efficiency.
Energy conservation measures which  should be employed include:  1. orienting buildings to maximize solar access,  2. utilization of landscape design techniques and species that maximize protection from excess heat   in the summer and allow solar exposure in the winter,  3. minimizing the amount of roads and streets needed to serve the development,  4. utilizing “green” site design to minimize thermal stress on surface waters from stormwater runoff   and to minimize potential storage and release of excess heat from impervious surfaces, and  5. dedication of areas for community gardens.
I.
Every Planned Development shall include management agreement provisions for the control and  maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership as prescribed in Article     110   Article V: Zoning District Requirements IV, Section 10.4 of this Ordinance.

19.4  Dimensional Requirements:  A.
Minimum Planned Development Site Size:  The minimum size of the Planned Development site  shall be five (5) acres.
Not less than eighty (80) percent of the gross land area of the proposed devel- opment site shall consist of developable land area.
B.
Minimum Lot Size Within a Planned Development: No minimum building site is required, provid- ed that the land used for building coverage and off-street parking and loading spaces as required  in Article IV, Section 5, does not preclude adequate open spaces for landscaping, and for recreation  facilities for the occupants of dwellings.
The proposed minimum and average building sites, the re- sulting average net density (families per acre of residential land use), the total land used for every  purpose (including right-of-way), the number of off-street parking and loading spaces for each use  area, and the total and average land area covered by the building in each use area, shall be calculated  and shown on the master plan of development.
Specific minimum lot sizes may be imposed by the  Tallapoosa County Health Department for proper siting and installation of on-site sewage disposal  facilities, where municipal sewer access is not available.
C. Minimum Building Setback Line:  1.
Thirty (30) feet from the edge of the right-of-way line.

The minimum dimension of the yard upon which any entrance or exit of a dwelling faces shall be ten  (10) feet; such space shall not be counted as a yard for any other building.
F. Maximum Structure Height: Forty-five (45) feet.
G. Maximum Percentage Of Site Covered By Impervious Surfaces: Forty (40) percent of gross area of   Planned Development site area.
Fifty (50) percent for any individual lot within the Planned Develop- ment.
19.5  General Review and Approval Procedures.
The potential complexity of a Planned Develop- ment demands an extensive review and approval process.
To help ensure a smooth and efficient admin- istrative process, the following steps shall be observed:   A.
Preliminary Conceptual Review.
Prior to submission of a formal rezoning petition for a proposed  Planned Development, the applicant or developer shall meet informally with the Enforcement Officer  to discuss the development concept and to ensure that the applicant procedures and requirements  are understood.
Such review shall not require detailed plan specifications, but any sketch plans pre-    City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     111  Article V: Zoning District Requirements pared shall be sufficient to clearly convey the overall design scheme, the intended land uses, and  the overall intensity of development that will be proposed.
A preliminary conceptual review shall be  conducted in accordance with the provisions for a pre-application conference as specified in Article  V, Sections 2 and 3 of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations.
B. Rezoning Petition.
After a preliminary conceptual review has been conducted, the applicant or  developer may submit a formal petition for rezoning to the Planning Commission.
Said petition shall  be accompanied by a master plan for development as required by Section 19.3, Subparagraph A of  this Article.
Review and approval of the rezoning petition and master plan of development shall be  conducted concurrently in accordance with the procedures specified in Article VIII of this Ordinance.
Approval by the City Council of a rezoning petition and master plan of development shall not autho- rize construction of the proposed development, if approval of a subdivision plan is required.
C. Subdivision Approval.
Once a petition for rezoning and the master plan for development has been  approved by the City Council, the applicant or developer may proceed with the preparation, submis- sion, and approval of a preliminary subdivision plat for the proposed development.
Such preliminary  plat submission, review, and approval shall be conducted by the Planning Commission in accordance  with the procedures and requirements specified in Article V, Sections 2 and 4 of the Alexander City  Subdivision Regulations.
D. Expedited and Consolidated Planning Commission Review Procedures.
To help minimize the im- pact of a complicated review process, the City of Alexander City shall make provisions for an expe- dited and consolidated review process by the Planning Commission.
If requested in writing by the  applicant or developer and approved by the City Council prior to submission of a formal rezoning pe- tition, special provisions for the Planning Commission’s review of the rezoning petition, master plan  of development, and preliminary subdivision plat to be conducted simultaneously and in accordance  with the review procedures for a Preliminary Plat  under Article V of the Alexander City Subdivision  Regulations may be allowed.
Such approval by the City Council shall specifically waive the 30 day re- porting deadline for the Planning Commission’s decision regarding the rezoning petition as specified  in Article VIII, Section 4 of this Ordinance.
Such a waiver is necessary to permit the longer review time  that may be required for the joint review of a Preliminary Plat, the master plan of development, and  the rezoning petition.
If an expedited and combined review is requested by the applicant or devel- oper and approved by the City Council in accordance with this provision, the Planning Commission’s  review and public hearing process shall be conducted in accordance with the Preliminary Plat review  procedures specified in Article V, Sections 2 and 4 of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations.
However, construction work on the proposed development in accordance with the approved pre- liminary subdivision plat shall not occur unless and until the City Council has approved the required  rezoning petition and master plan of development, and the Planning Commission shall condition any  approval of the preliminary plat on said rezoning approval by the City Council.

SECTION 3 - TEMPORARY LAND USES   3.1  Temporary uses, as set forth below, are declared to possess characteristics which require certain     118   Article VI: Administrative and Enforcement Guidelines controls in order to insure compatibility with other uses in the districts within which they are proposed  for location.

The deadline for correction of the violation shall be established  by the Zoning Enforcement Officer with due consideration and respect for the nature of the violation, the  amount of work necessary to correct the violation, and the need for expeditious remedy of the violation  to prevent undue public impacts.
However, in no instance shall the deadline for correction of the viola- tion be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date that the letter was mailed.
The letter also shall state that the owner must correct the violation, or the City will issue a citation.
Final- ly, the letter shall afford the offending property owner an opportunity to schedule a meeting with the  Zoning Enforcement Officer within five (5) business days to discuss objections to the violation or to make  special arrangements to cure the violation.
Such notification letter shall be sent to the property owner  via certified mail, return receipt requested.
The City may, at the discretion of the Zoning Enforcement  Officer, send a copy of the letter to the developer or tenant of the property (as the case may be) by first  class mail.
4.3  Re-inspection.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall, at the expiration of the prescribed dead- line for correction of the violation, re-inspect the property for compliance with the notification of viola- tion.
4.4  Notice of citation.
If, upon re-inspection, the Zoning Enforcement Officer confirms that the  violation has not been cured as ordered, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall prepare a notice of cita- tion, which shall be sent to the offending property by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The notice  shall state the date upon which the initial violation was confirmed, the nature of the violation (including     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     119  Article VI: Administrative and Enforcement Guidelines references to the specific code provisions that have been violated), the required corrective measures, the  dates upon which the initial notification of violation was sent and received, the time frame afforded to  the property owner for correction of the violation, the date that the failure to correct the violation was  confirmed, and the amount of the applicable fine, which shall be calculated from the date of citation and  full payment of which shall constitute an additional remedial action for correction of the violation.
The  notice also shall require the property owner to fully correct the violation within ten (10) days of the date  of citation, or the owner will be required to appear before the Municipal Court, at a time and date to be  determined by the Municipal Court, to answer the charge of violation as explained in the notice of cita- tion.

Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission, the  City Council shall schedule and hold a public hearing on the recommended zoning of the property to be  annexed.
Such hearing shall not be held until the City Council has annexed said property into the City,  but may be  conducted immediately following adoption of the annexation ordinances.
The City Council  shall give public notice of the hearing on the recommended zoning in accordance with Subparagraph     126   Article VIII: Amendments 5.2 (Public hearing notice) of this Article.
Following such hearing, the City Council shall decide by ma- jority vote to accept or reject the recommended zoning.
If the recommended zoning is accepted, such  property shall be added to the Alexander City Zoning Map.
If the recommended zoning is rejected, such  ordinances shall be remanded to the Planning Commission for reconsideration.
7.4  Planning Commission reconsideration.
If the City Council rejects the zoning recommended  by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission, within thirty (30) days following annexation,  shall review the zoning of the newly annexed property and, if determined necessary, initiate a petition to  rezone the property to the most appropriate district, in accordance with Section 3 (Petition for Amend- ment) of this Article.
No fee shall be paid by the applicant for any reconsideration and rezoning action  by the Planning Commission conducted in accordance with this Subparagraph.
In determining the most  appropriate zoning, the Planning Commission shall duly consider the following minimum items:   A.
The Alexander City Comprehensive Plan, as adopted by the Planning Commission, as well as other  relevant land use and planning studies;   B.
The desires of the property owner subject to rezoning, as well as concerns of adjacent property own- ers;   C. The purposes and considerations of zoning, as required by this ordinance and Section 11-52-72 of the  Code of Alabama, as amended.
7.5  Action on Planning Commission petition.
The Planning Commission and City Council shall  act on the Planning Commission petition to rezone the newly annexed property in accordance with the  procedures set forth in Sections 4 and 5 of this Article.
SECTION 8 - SPECULATIVE REZONINGS   The City of Alexander City discourages the use of rezonings as a strategy to increase speculative land value,  where the applicant has no actual or immediate intent to develop in accordance with the rezoning.
Rezonings  are intended to grant the applicant an opportunity to exercise appropriate alternative development options  in situations where development in compliance with existing zoning is not possible or practicable, as long as  the proposed uses are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the character of the surrounding area.
The granting of this privilege by the City carries with it a good faith expectation that the proposed devel- opment will occur in a timely and deliberate manner.
Therefore, when the City Council grants approval of a  rezoning, the applicant should acquire a zoning permit or final plat approval (whichever is applicable) and  commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one (1) year of the date  upon which the rezoning is approved.
If such actions have not been taken within the specified time frame,  the Planning Commission may initiate actions to further rezone the subject property and/or to reinstate the  original zoning classification.
SECTION 9 - FEES    9.1  Every applicant or petitioner seeking an amendment to the zoning ordinance or map of the  City of Alexander City, other than amendments initiated by the City Council, Enforcement Officer, Board  of Adjustment, or Planning Commission, shall pay a fee to the City Clerk at the time of filing such petition  or application.
9.2  A flat administrative and review fee of $500.00 shall accompany each request for appeal or zon- ing amendment.
9.3  In addition, the actual costs for legal advertisement of the request and notification of parties     City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     127  Article VIII: Amendments in interest shall be paid by the applicant prior to any decision by the Board of Adjustment, the Planning  Commission or the City Council.
128   Article VIII: Amendments ARTICLE IX: LEGAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 1 - CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS   In interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be considered minimum requirements  adopted for the promotion of health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and general welfare of the  community.
Where two or more specific requirements in this ordinance conflict and the ordinance does not  otherwise specify which of the conflicting requirements prevail, then the requirement imposing the higher  or greater restriction shall govern.
Where other ordinances or regulations which may be adopted hereafter  impose greater restrictions than those specified herein, compliance with such other ordinances or regulations  is mandatory.
Whenever the requirements of this ordinance conflict or are in any way inconsistent with the  requirements of any other lawfully adopted statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, the most restrictive, or  that imposing higher standards, shall govern, unless otherwise specifically stated in this Ordinance.
No cer- tificate of zoning compliance or plat approval shall be issued or considered valid for any use or activity which  is or would be otherwise illegal under the terms of any applicable local, State, or Federal Law.
This Ordinance  shall not lower the restrictions of plats, deeds, or private contracts, if such are greater than the provisions of  this Ordinance.
SECTION 2 - REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES   All previously adopted zoning ordinances or parts of zoning ordinances that are in conflict with this Zoning  Ordinance, or inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance, are hereby repealed to the extent necessary  to give this Ordinance full force and effect.
SECTION 3 - SEVERABILITY   If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by  any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, provision, or por- tion of this Ordinance which is not, in and of itself, invalid or unconstitutional.
SECTION 4 - VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES   Any failure to comply with the applicable requirements of this Ordinance shall constitute a violation of these  Regulations under Title 11, Chapter 52, Section 83 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended.
Any such  violation shall be punishable by a fine of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dol- lars ($500.00) and or imprisonment of not more than six (6) months, as provided in accordance with Title 11,  Chapter 45, Section 9 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended.
Where such a violation has been confirmed  to exist by the Enforcement Officer, the violation shall be cured in accordance with the administrative proce- dures outlined in Article VI, Section 4 of these Regulations.
Each day such violation continues shall constitute  a separate offense.
In case any building or other structure is erected, demolished, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired,  converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is used in violation of this ordinance, the building  official of the municipality or any other appropriate authority, in addition to other remedies, may institute  injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, demoli- tion, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, to correct or abate such  violations or to prevent occupancy of such building, structures, or land.
City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     129  Article VIII: Amendments SECTION 5 - RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND BYLAWS   A property owner may impose bylaws, covenants, and deed restrictions upon any private property.
Once  any such bylaws, covenants, and deed restrictions have been recorded, they can be administered only by the  owner of the property, and they may be enforced only by private legal action through a court of competent  jurisdiction.
The City of Alexander City and the Alexander City Planning Commission is in no way liable for and  assumes no responsibility to approve, enforce, amend, or administer any duly adopted or recorded bylaws,  covenants, and deed restrictions.
Furthermore, advance knowledge by the City prior to Final Plat approval  that any such bylaws, covenants, and deed restrictions will be imposed by the land owner shall in no way  constitute implied authority or responsibility to approve, enforce, amend, or administer any subsequently ad- opted or recorded restrictive covenants or bylaws.
Finally, no such authority shall be implied by the granting  of a zoning permit for any development activity on a property for which special bylaws, covenants, or deed  restrictions have been or will be imposed.
SECTION 6 - EFFECTIVE DATE   This Ordinance shall take effect on the date of final publication by the City, in accordance with Title 11, Chapter  45, Section 8 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended.

(b) The official zoning map shall be drawn on durable transparent material from which prints   can be made and shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
6   (c) The Zoning Administrator shall update the official zoning map within ninety to one hundred  twenty days after amendments to it are adopted by the City Council.
(d) Should the official zoning map or any portion thereof be lost, destroyed, damaged, or   difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of revisions, the Zoning Administrator  shall have a new map drawn and adopted by resolution of the City Council.
The new map  may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior map, but no such correction  shall have the effect of amending the maps.
Any map amendment shall follow rezoning  amendment procedures contained in this ordinance.
Sec.
22.
Zoning District Boundaries.
The rules of this section shall be used to determine the precise locations of any district  boundary shown on the Rainbow City Zoning Map.
(1) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following any jurisdictional limits   shall be construed as following such limits.
(2) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets, alleys, or rights- of-way shall be construed as following such streets, alleys, or rights-of-way.
(3) Boundary lines which follow or approximately follow platted lot lines or other   property lines as shown on the Etowah County Tax Maps shall be construed as  following such lines.
(4) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be   construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines.
(5) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following shorelines of any lakes  or ponds shall be construed to follow the mean high water lines of such lakes or  ponds.
In the event of a change in the mean high waterline, the boundaries shall be  construed as moving with the actual mean high waterline.
(6) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerline of streams,   rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following  the channel of such water courses taken at mean low water.
In the event of a natural  change in the location of such streams, rivers, or other water courses, the district  boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
(7) Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any   of the features listed in paragraphs (1) through (6) above shall be construed to be  parallel to such features.
In the absence of specific dimensions, the scale of the map  shall determine the distance from such features.

23.
District Use Regulations.
Unless otherwise provided, no building, structure, or land shall be used except in the zoning  districts indicated by this article and according to the regulations of this ordinance and other  applicable codes and ordinances.
Sec.
24.
Use Limitations Due to Zoning Standards.
A use may be permitted only if it can meet all of the standards of this ordinance and other  applicable codes and ordinances.
Sec.
25.
Combined Principal and Accessory Uses.
(a) Unless otherwise prevented by this ordinance, more than one permitted principal use may be   combined on a lot if all of the combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally  related to one another.
Further, all zoning regulations for each of the combined uses shall be  met.
(b) Whenever an activity, which may or may not be separately listed in the district, is conducted   in conjunction with a permitted use in the district as an incidental or insubstantial part of the  total activity on a lot, the incidental activity shall be permitted as an accessory use if the  combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally related to one another.
(c) For the purpose of this section, “commonly associated” means that the association of such   combined uses takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common community  acceptance of their relatedness.
Sec.
26.
Interpretation of Uses.
This ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings, given the infinite  variations of essentially similar uses.
Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to  make interpretations so as to classify any questioned use as falling within a listed use of  similar impact and characteristics.
However, in no case shall the Zoning Administrator  interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in question is more similar in impact  and characteristics to another listed use.
Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's use  interpretation may be filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
Sec.
27.
Unclassified Uses.
In the event the Zoning Administrator finds a new or unusual use that cannot appropriately  fit a listed use in any district, the following procedures shall be followed:     (1) If compatible with the existing zoning district intent, the unclassified use shall be   permitted by special exception upon approval of and subject to the conditions set by  the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
8     (2) If the unclassified use is not compatible with the intent of the existing zoning district,   the Zoning Administrator shall determine the most appropriate district classification  and require the property in question to be rezoned.
In addition, the unclassified use  shall be permitted in the new district by special exception if granted approval by the  Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(3) Following the final action on the unclassified use, as (1) or (2) above may require,   the Planning Commission shall initiate an amendment to this ordinance to list the  newly permitted use into the most appropriate district(s).
Sec.

SIGN REGULATIONS    Sec.
210.
Purpose of Sign Regulations.
The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the construction, maintenance, and  regulation of outdoor advertising within the City.
While Rainbow City acknowledges the  legitimate public need for business visibility, local businesses must also recognize the  legitimate public need for a beautiful and uncluttered community and the City’s legitimate  need to ensure safe traffic circulation on City streets.
Local experience within Rainbow City,  Gadsden, Atlanta, and Birmingham generally supports the contention that excessive,  competing signage along public streets can create visual clutter, which makes it difficult for  motorists to see traffic control and highway safety signs and to know where entrances to  adjoining businesses are located.
The City also has determined that excessive, competing  signage can divert motorist attention from the highway, which contributes to traffic  accidents.
Therefore, Rainbow City has determined that it is desirable to prescribe the  manner of sign construction and to compel the use of safe materials; limit the number, type,  surface area, height, and location of signs; and require clean and sanitary maintenance of  signs in order to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the community.
Further, these sign regulations are intended to lessen hazards to pedestrian and vehicular  traffic; preserve property values; prevent unsightly and detrimental development which has a  blighting influence upon the community; and, in general, preserve the character and aesthetic  quality of the various zones within the city.
Sec.

TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS, ANTENNAS, AND SATELLITE DISHES    Sec.
230.
Purpose of  Regulations.
The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the placement and appearance of  telecommunication towers, antennas, and satellite dishes under the Telecommunications Act  of 1996, where such control does not conflict with or unreasonably constrain the legitimate  right of businesses to exercise free trade.
Rainbow City desires access to advanced  technology to serve its businesses and citizens, but not at the expense of the community’s  overall appearance and public image.
Rainbow City seeks to impose sensible controls on  telecommunication facilities, in order to maintain the aesthetic character and charm of the  community and its neighborhoods against the insensitive and uncontrolled proliferation and  placement of wireless facilities.
New telecommunications towers should not create a  cluttered landscape or dominate the community’s skyline as it is viewed from the primary  highway entrances to Rainbow City.
To that end, the City desires to partner with  telecommunications firms to ensure expansion of the existing telecommunications  infrastructure that will provide effective advanced communications services throughout the  City and surrounding environs, commensurate with local needs, with a minimal visual  impact on the character and charm of the community, and without creating impediments to  free competition among wireless telecommunications providers seeking to serve the City.
These regulations have been developed by the City to achieve the aforementioned objectives.
Sec.
231.

Jurisdiction of Regulations.
All communication facilities or structures greater than one (1) meter in size, including but  not limited to those facilities known as “cellular”, “personal communication system (PCS)”,  “paging services”, and similar services, shall comply with these regulations.
However, the  following shall be exempt from these regulations under the specified conditions:     (a) Public Property.

Sec.
233.
Basic Requirements and Design Considerations.
All proposed communication facilities (towers and antennas) governed by these regulations  shall comply with the following requirements and guidelines.
(a) Compliance with FAA Regulations.
All proposed communication facilities shall   comply with all applicable FAA requirements, including but not limited to, Part 77 of  the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), as amended.
(b) Compliance with FCC Regulations.
All proposed communication facilities shall   comply with all applicable FCC requirements, including but not limited to, the  Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended.
85   (c) Structural Safety.
All proposed communication facilities shall comply with wind  loading and other applicable structural standards contained in local building and  technical codes, as they may be in effect and amended from time to time, including,  without limitation, the Southern Standard Building Code and the Electronic  Industries Association Code and any amendments thereto or replacements thereof, as  may be adopted by the City Council.
The City’s Building Inspector or his/her  designee shall determine whether a proposed communication facility will comply  with this requirement.
(d) Appearance and View Protection.
All proposed communication facilities with the   exception of proposed antennas that will be co-located on a pre-existing tower shall  be attractively camouflaged, disguised, or hidden in a manner that it will blend into  the surrounding environment to the greatest extent possible.
Examples of proper  camouflaging include: designing a tower to resemble a tree, designing a monopole to  look like and function as a flag pole or freestanding sign support, hiding an antenna  within a church steeple, or any other effective means of disguising the appearance of  a tower or antenna that may be appropriate for the setting in the area surrounding the  proposed communication facility site.
It shall be the burden of the applicant to  document and prove that a proposed communication facility cannot be effectively  camouflaged, before approval of a non-camouflaged structure may be permitted by  the City.
In such instances, the applicant shall explore alternative means of  minimizing the visual impact of the antenna, such as installing it onto an existing  telephone pole, streetlight, or building rooftop, rather than erecting a new tower  specifically for the proposed antenna.
However, in no instance shall a non- camouflaged communication facility be approved for a residential property.
(e) Signs prohibited.
No signs or other forms of advertising, including signs displaying   the name of the owner or user of the tower or antenna, may be attached to or depicted  on a communication facility, unless the proposed facility is a new monopole  specifically camouflaged and approved to serve as a permitted freestanding sign  support.
This prohibition shall not apply to any required warning or private property  posting signs.
(f) Construction materials.
Where applicable building codes, technical codes, and   federal regulations permit flexibility in the choice of construction materials and  where the selection of alternative construction materials will not compromise the  structural integrity of the proposed communication facility, proposed new towers and  monopoles shall be constructed of materials that have a composition, texture, and  color that will most closely resemble structures and natural features that exist on and  adjoining the facility site.
(g) Health Effects.
All proposed communication facilities shall comply with all   applicable FCC regulations and requirements in effect to prevent detrimental health          86     effects from the proposed communication facilities.
Under the Telecommunications  Act of 1996, the City cannot deny a request to construct a communication facility on  the grounds that its radio frequency or electromagnetic emissions would be harmful  to the environment or the health of residents, if those emissions meet FCC standards.
(h) Interference with Existing Communication Facilities.
All proposed communication   facilities shall comply with all applicable FCC regulations and requirements in effect  to prevent interference with existing communication facilities serving the area.
(i) Siting Requirements for Whip Antennas.
Whip antennas shall not be allowed on a   wall mounted antenna structure.
(j) Co-location.
No new tower or monopole shall be erected on a proposed  communication facility site unless the applicant can document and prove that an  existing co-location site is not available or is not technically capable of serving the  specific telecommunication need in the area of the proposed site.
This co-location  requirement may be waived by the City where the proposed antenna would create an  excessively cluttered appearance on the available co-location site (thereby drawing  greater visual attention to the existing antenna site or creating a more imposing  obstruction to scenic views and vistas from the area) and the proposed new antenna  would be less visible or intrusive on the surrounding area if effectively camouflaged  on an alternate site.
(k) Setback Requirements.
All proposed communication facilities and structures,   including guys and accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum setback  requirements of the zoning district in which they will be sited.
However, all  proposed tower compounds that will be located on a residential property shall be  subject to an additional setback from all property boundaries of the site equal to the  height of the tower structure as measured from the finished ground level at the base  or pad surface to the tallest point of the structure.
If the tower compound abuts a  property with an existing or approved (but not yet constructed or completed)  residential use, the residential property setback requirement shall be satisfied for all  property boundaries of the site that abut said existing or approved residential uses.
(l) Lighting.
Towers may not be artificially lighted, except where required to satisfy   applicable FAA regulations.
Lights for security and to assist in making emergency  repairs may be installed on buildings within the tower compound which contain  equipment essential to the operation and maintenance of the tower.
Such lights shall  be shielded and directed in a downward direction from a height of not more than ten  (10) feet, and no such light may exceed a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) watts.
Such lights shall be located and directed so that they do not shine, reflect, or  generate excessive glare onto or toward any residential property or adjoining  property upon which a residential use exists or has been approved for construction.
87   (m) Security Fence.
All communication facilities to be located within a proposed tower  compound shall be secured by the construction of an eight (8) foot high security  fence or wall constructed, at a minimum, using chain link fencing.
(n) Landscaping.
All proposed tower compounds must be surrounded by a landscaped   buffer which shall provide an effective year-round screen to a height of at least eight  (8) feet upon planting in order to screen views of the tower compound from adjacent  public ways, residential properties, and properties upon which a residential use exists  or has been approved for construction.
The buffer shall include a landscaped strip at  least four (4) feet in depth located outside of the security fence or wall.
The  landscaped strip shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, vines, and  grown covers which are capable of attaining, at maturity, a height as high as the  security fence or wall and which will enhance and screen the outward appearance of  the security fence.
The use of native species of plants and trees are encouraged to the  extent that they will satisfy the requirement for adequate year-round screening.
The  applicant shall provide documentation to show what forms of vegetation will be  planted within the landscaped area and how the area will be effectively maintained to  ensure the long-term health of the plantings.
Such documentation shall include the  name, mailing address, and business telephone number of the party who shall be  responsible for the maintenance and repair of the communication facilities and any  fences, walls, and landscaped buffer areas.
If the person or party responsible for  such maintenance and repair changes any time after approval has been issued, the  owner of the tower must provide the City’s Enforcement Officer with written notice  of the new party’s name, mailing address, and business telephone number and the  date upon which the change will become effective.
(o) Communication Facility Siting Priorities.
When selecting sites within the City to   locate proposed communication facilities or tower compounds, priority shall be given  to locations in non-residential zoning districts.
Residential property sites shall be  given the lowest possible consideration for new sites.
(p) Access and Parking.
A driveway and parking area with a surface appropriate for the   intensity of use shall be provided for each proposed tower compound to provide  adequate access to the tower compound for the maintenance and repair of the  communication facilities and for vehicle providing emergency services.
Subject to  the approval of the City Council and to an appropriate agreement with the owner  thereof, access and parking for the tower compound may be provided on an adjoining  property or along one or more public streets adjoining the tower compound.
Sec.
234.
Levels of Review and Approval.
In recognition of the high standards for proposed communication facilities established by this  Ordinance, allowances have been made for an efficient and, in certain instances, expedited          88   review process, where the applicant can demonstrate that a good faith effort to embrace and  comply with the spirit and intent of these guidelines has been made in the design of the  proposal.
The three levels of review and approval and the types of projects that can be  considered within each level are as follows:     (a) Review and Approval by Enforcement Officer.
The following types of   communication facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the Enforcement Officer  without the need for a public hearing, provided the proposed improvements fully  complies with all requirements specified in Section 233 of this Article:     (1) Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be co-located on   an existing approved or registered pre-existing tower, as long as the proposed  antenna(s) will not protrude at any point from the exterior surface of said  tower by a distance of more than four (4) feet and the tower will contain no  more than five (5) antennas if the application is approved.
In addition, the  supporting equipment for the proposed antenna(s) shall not require the  construction of any new freestanding structures on the tower compound.
(2) Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be sited in an   existing structure that fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this  Ordinance (not a non-conforming structure) and where, after installation, the  antenna and all supporting equipment will be completely enclosed by the  exterior walls of the structure or completely screened from public view at any  point on the land within two (2) thousand feet of the proposed antenna.
An  example of such a scenario would be the placement of an antenna within the  steeple of a church or the dome of a farm silo.
The addition of the antenna  and supporting equipment to the existing conforming structure shall not  require the construction of an addition to house the communication facilities.
However, interior modifications to the structure may be permitted as part of  the approval by the Enforcement Officer.
(b) Review and Approval Exclusively by City Council.
The City Council shall have the   authority to review and approve the following specific types of communication  facilities and tower compounds, subject to the conduct of a public hearing, but  without the need for a formal recommendation from the Planning Commission:     (1) Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be installed on a   co-location site that does not fall within the approval authority of the  Enforcement Officer, as specified in Subparagraph (a) (1) of this Section.
(2) Any new antenna (not including a tower) that will be attached to an existing   structure that fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this  Ordinance (not a non-conforming structure), but that would not otherwise fall            89    within the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer as specified in  Subparagraph (a) (2) of this Section.
(3) Any new monopole not greater than thirty (30) feet in height and located in a   non-residential zoning district that is camouflaged or disguised in such a way  that it cannot be immediately recognized as an antenna support.
(4) Any new antenna or tower to be located on property owned, leased, or   otherwise controlled by the City of Rainbow City and located within a non- residential zoning district.
(c) Review and Approval by City Council Upon Recommendation From Planning   Commission.
All applications not subject to review and approval by the Enforcement  Officer in accordance with Subparagraph (a) of this Section or review and approval  exclusively by the City Council in accordance with Subparagraph (b) of this Section  shall be subject to review and public hearings by both the Planning Commission and  the City Council.
The Planning Commission shall review the application and issue a  recommendation for approval or denial to the City Council.
Final review and  approval or denial of the application shall be issued exclusively by the City Council.
Sec.
235.
Approval Procedures.
Review and approval of an application shall be conducted in accordance with the following  procedures.
(a) Pre-Application Consultation.
Any applicant seeking to develop communication   facilities or tower compounds that fall within the jurisdiction of these regulations  may request an informal  consultation with the Enforcement Officer and/or Building  Inspector prior to the preparation and submission of a formal application.
The  purpose of this voluntary consultation shall be to answer specific questions about the  process or applicable design requirements, discuss possible camouflaging or co- location options, or discuss application format options and/or potential supporting  documentation submission needs.
Any such consultation discussions must occur  before a formal application is submitted to the City, shall be non-binding on the  applicant and the City, and shall not in any way constitute or be interpreted to  constitute a decision to approve or deny an application.
(b) Receipt of Application.
All required applications shall be submitted to the   Enforcement Officer.
Upon submission, the Enforcement Officer shall determine  that the application contains all submission requirements specified in Section 236 of  this Article and is, therefore, complete.
No incomplete application shall be received  by the City for review and approval.
Once the Enforcement Officer determines the             90    application is complete, the application shall be determined to have been received by  the City on that date.
(c) Enforcement Officer Review.
The Enforcement Officer and/or Building Official shall   review a complete application within thirty-one (31) days of the date of receipt.
At  the end of that review, the Enforcement Officer shall issue approval or denial for  those aspects of the application that fall within the approval authority of the  Enforcement Officer, as specified in Section 234, Subparagraph (a) of this Article.
If  the application or any part of the application is denied, the Enforcement Officer shall  provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining the specific findings of  fact used by the City as the basis of the denial.
Such denial shall be based on the  unwillingness of the applicant to comply with the requirements of the regulations  and/or the failure of the application to satisfy specific basic requirements and design  considerations outlined in Section 233 of these regulations.
If the Enforcement  Officer fails to render a decision on the application within the required thirty-one  (31) days, then aspects of the application subject to review and approval by the  Enforcement Officer shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further  consideration by the City.
However, the City Council may grant an extension to the  thirty-one (31) day deadline not to exceed an additional thirty-one (31) days, due to  extended illness or absence of the Enforcement Officer during the required review  and approval period or the submission of an application that is too large or extensive  to be reviewed by existing staff resources within the prescribed time frame.
On the  date that the Enforcement Officer’s review period ends, any remaining portions of  the application not subject to approval or denial by the Enforcement Officer shall be  submitted to the City Council and/or Planning Commission for action, as may be  applicable.
The forwarded application shall be accompanied by a written report from  the Enforcement Officer regarding his/her assessment of the proposed  communication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applicable requirements  specified in Section 233 of this Article.
(d) Planning Commission and City Council Review.
All applications or portions of   applications requiring review and approval of the City Council and/or Planning  Commission in accordance with Section 234, Subparagraphs (b) or (c) of this Article  shall follow the same general guidelines as for an amendment to this Ordinance as  specified in Article VIII (Amendments) of this Ordinance, with the specific  exception that Planning Commission review shall not be required for applications  that may be approved exclusively by the City Council, in accordance with Section  234, Subparagraph (b) of this Article.
(e) Public Hearing.
The City Council and, if necessary, Planning Commission shall   each conduct one public hearing on the application at the earliest regular meeting  date that will satisfy the public hearing notice requirements following the date of  submission by the Enforcement Officer.
The required public hearing shall be noticed            91    in the same manner prescribed in the applicable Sections of Article V, Division 4,  Section 345 of this Ordinance (Subparagraph [b] for the Planning Commission and  Subparagraphs [a] and [c] for the City Council).
At the hearing, the presiding body  shall entertain a report from the Enforcement Officer regarding his/her assessment of  the proposed communication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applicable  requirements specified in Section 233 of this Article.
A written copy of the  Enforcement Officer’s report shall be incorporated into the minutes of the public  hearing, along with a written synopsis of all public comments received and an  attendance sheet identifying the names and mailing addresses of every person who  attended the public hearing.
(f) Decision.
The presiding body shall render a decision on the application within thirty-  one (31) days from the date that the public hearing is closed.
For the Planning  Commission, such decision shall be in the form of a written recommendation, along  with a list of the findings of fact upon which the recommendation was based, to the  City Council for final action.
If the Planning Commission fails to render a formal  recommendation on the application within the required thirty-one (31) days, then the  application shall be transmitted to the City Council for final decision with an  automatic or implied recommendation of approval.
If the City Council fails to render  a decision on the application within the required thirty-one (31) days, then the  application shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further  consideration by the City.
If the application or any part of the application is denied,  the City Council shall provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining  the specific findings of fact used by the City Council as the basis of the denial.
Such  denial shall be based on the unwillingness of the applicant to comply with the  requirements of the regulations or specific basic requirements and design  considerations outlined in Section 233 of these regulations that the application fails  to satisfy.
Sec.
236.
Submission Requirements.
All applications to construct communication facilities that fall within the jurisdiction of these  regulations shall provide adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance with all  applicable basic requirements and design considerations specified in Section 233 of these  regulations.
A single application may include any number of proposed tower compounds  that will be located within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, even though some of the  proposed tower compounds may be subject to expedited review procedures as provided in  Section 234 of this Article.
Where an application includes tower compounds subject to  different levels of review, the application may be divided into sections for each review  category, within which all necessary supporting information for each proposed tower  compound shall be provided.
Whenever portions of an application have been approved or  denied through an expedited review process, that information and any terms of said approval  or denial shall be noted and considered in the subsequent review procedures for the          92   remaining portions of the application.
The Enforcement Officer shall determine the number  of application copies that must be submitted by the applicant, based on the number of parties  who must review the application.
One (1) copy of the application shall be required for each  of the following review agents, as may be required: the Enforcement Officer, Building  Inspector (if such person is not the Enforcement Officer), Planning Commission (as a body),  and the City Council (as a body).
At a minimum, each required application shall contain the  following:     (a) A completed zoning permit application form, including the required application fee.
(b) A site plan of the tower compound, prepared by a surveyor, at a scale not less than   one (1) inch to fifty (50) feet, showing the location, street address, tax parcel  identification number, and dimensions of the parcel of land that will contain the  tower compound, the location of all required setback lines,  driveways, parking areas,  buffers, fencing, landscaping, storm water management improvements, fuel tanks  (both above and below ground), and structures that exist or will be constructed on the  property.
If the property upon which a proposed tower compound will be located  exceeds one hundred (100) acres in size, then the scale of the site plan shall be  increased to one (1) inch to one hundred (100) feet, or the Enforcement Officer may  grant authority to the applicant to limit the site plan coverage to a specified area  around the proposed tower compound.
(c) Written proof of ownership of the proposed tower compound or authorization to use   it.
(d) A written report including a description of the proposed tower or antenna with the  technical reasons for its design, a certificate from the project engineer documenting   the structural integrity of the tower or antenna support for its proposed use including  any co-located communication facilities that may already exist at the site, and an  affidavit signed by the owner of the proposed communication facilities and the  project engineer attesting compliance of the proposed communication facilities with  all applicable FCC requirements with regard to any potential detrimental health  effects that could be generated by the proposed facilities.
(e) A silhouette and elevation view of the proposed tower (or the existing tower, if the   applicant is seeking permission to install an antenna on an existing tower) and all  other communication facilities, and the tower compound, describing colors and  materials to be used for the communication facilities and any security fence,  decorative fence, and decorative wall.
The configuration of proposed antenna arrays  must be shown on the silhouette.
The proposed location of future, additional antenna  arrays must be shown on the silhouette by dashed lines.
The elevation view shall  portray the general context and compatibility of the proposed facilities with respect  to surrounding structures and natural features.
93   (f) Copies of any proposed easements, where applicable to the project.
(g) Documentation of the frequency band and wattage of the proposed communication  facilities.
(h) For each new monopole, tower, or antenna that is not otherwise located on a co-  location site, a written report documenting the attempts made by the applicant to  secure a suitable co-location site both within the city and in the adjoining  unincorporated areas and any supporting technical reasons supporting the need for a  new independent site.
Sec.
237.
Inspection/Fee.
To determine whether tower compounds are in compliance with the requirements of this  Ordinance, the City shall make, or have made on its behalf, an annual inspection of the  communication facilities on each tower compound and the walls, fences, and landscaping  around each tower compound, for which an annual inspection fee of $200.00 shall be  imposed.
If more than one antenna is located on a tower, the annual inspection fee shall be  $300.00.
The fee shall be due on January 1 of each year and shall be delinquent if not paid  by January 31 of such year.
To help defray the cost of collecting delinquent fees, an  additional fee, in the amount equal to ten (10) percent of the fee shall be payable for each  month, or portion of a month, after January in which the fee remains unpaid.
If the fee is not  paid within three (3) months of its due date, the City may withdraw its permission for the  location of communication facilities on the tower compound, in which event, all  communication facilities must be removed from the tower compound within three (3) months  of the day on which the owner or owners of the tower receive notice of such withdrawal of  permission.
The fee shall be payable by, and shall be the responsibility of the owner or  owners of the tower, even if additional antennas located on the tower are owned by other  parties.
If there is more than one owner of the tower, each owner shall be jointly and  severally liable for the entire amount of the fee and any additional fees due because of  delinquency in payment.
Any inspection conducted in accordance with these regulations  shall not be relate to the safety or structural soundness of the communication facilities or  tower.
The purpose of the inspection shall be limited to determining whether such  communication facilities and tower compound are in compliance with the provisions of this  Ordinance.
Any violation of the provisions of the Ordinance that are discovered through  said inspection shall be processed and resolved in accordance with the procedures specified  in Article V, Division 5 of this Ordinance.
Sec.
238.
Removal of Obsolete Towers.
94   Any tower that is no longer serving an active communication use shall be removed at the  owner’s expense.
The owner shall provide the Enforcement Officer with a copy of the notice  to the FCC of intent to cease operations and remove the tower and all associated    communication facilities from the site within three (3) months from the date that all  operations ceased.
Where a tower serves as a co-location site, this provision shall not apply  until all active users cease operation.
If the owner of the tower fails to remove the tower as  required, the responsibility for removal shall then apply to the owner of the land upon which  the obsolete tower is located.
Once the responsibility for removal has shifted to the property  owner, the property owner shall remove the obsolete tower within one (1) month of the date  that tower owner’s removal deadline lapsed.
If neither the owner of the tower nor the owner  of the land removes the obsolete tower within the time prescribed herein, the City may, but  shall not be obligated to, remove the obsolete tower.
If the City removes the obsolete tower,  it shall be entitled to recover the cost of removal from the owner of the tower and/or the  owner of the land upon which the tower is located.

Conditional Use Procedures.
(a) Application for conditional use permit.
All permitted conditional uses, where listed in each   district, shall require the submission of an application to the Planning Commission.

In particular, the Planning Commission shall determine that satisfactory provisions have  been made concerning the following, among other considerations of this ordinance:             115   (1) Ingress and egress to the property and proposed structures or uses, with particular  attention to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control,  and emergency access.

However, all construction, site development, or site alteration must be completed  within one year, and use or occupancy must be established within 30 days after the  effective completion date.
(4) A lot that was legally platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance that does not   meet the lot area, width, or dimensional requirements for the district in which it is  located may be developed or used in conformity with all other provisions of this  ordinance.
Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage  with other lots in the same ownership.
(5) Any use in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance, or subsequent   amendment, that results in a nonconforming characteristic of use may continue in  nonconformity with the off-street parking and loading, screening and buffer yard,  sign, or supplemental standards so long as the kind or extent of such use does not  increase the ordinance requirements for such characteristics of use.
(6) A nonconforming use may occupy any part of a structure or lot that was arranged or   designed for such use unless occupancy of that part of the structure or lot has been  discontinued for a period exceeding six months.
Sec.
333.
Repair and Maintenance of Nonconformities.

Change in Use.
(a) Any nonconforming use which changes to a permitted use within the district in which it is   located shall not revert to a nonconforming use.
(b) A nonconforming use may change to a new nonconforming use, provided the new use is   more in keeping with the district in which it is located and is less objectionable and measures  less external impact than the existing nonconforming use.
In determining whether the new  use would be in greater conformity with this ordinance, impact criteria such as, but not  limited to, the following shall be evaluated:     (1) Traffic generation and congestion, including truck, passenger car, and pedestrian   traffic.
(2) Noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, odor, glare, or vibration.

Sec.
366.
Variance procedures.
(a) Justification for variance.
Variances to the terms of this ordinance may be granted in   specific cases upon a finding by the Board of Adjustment that the variance will not be  contrary to the public interest, that, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the  provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and that the spirit of this  ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.
More specifically, the Board shall  determine all of the following criteria have been satisfied:     (1) The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship, even to   the extent of authorizing nonconforming uses.
Where the Board authorizes a  nonconforming use in a district to prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors,  when taken together, must indicate that the plight of the premises in question is  unique in that they cannot be put reasonably to a conforming use because of the  limitations imposed upon them by reason of their classification in a specific zone.
(2) Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances.
(3) Hardship alone is not sufficient; Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship.
130   (4) Mere financial loss of a kind which might be common to all of the property owners  in a district in not an unnecessary hardship.
(5) Variances should be granted sparingly, and spirit of this ordinance in harmony with   the spirit of State law should be carefully preserved, to the end that the structure of  this ordinance would not disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands  of the Board.
(6) When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for claim that a   variance should be granted.
(b) Application for variance.
An application for a variance shall be filed with the Zoning   Administrator at least 21 days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board of  Adjustment.
The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent of  the owner and shall include the following information and materials:     (1) Name, signature, and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner,   if any.
(2) Address of the property under consideration.
(3) Zoning and land use of the property under consideration.
(4)  Nature of the variance, with reference to applicable zoning provisions.
(5) Justification for the variance, in accordance with all of the criteria in (a) above.
(6) A plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property boundaries and  proposed development layout, with the variance noted or highlighted.
(7) The names and addresses of each property owner adjacent to the property under   consideration, including those across the street, as listed in the Etowah County Tax  Assessor Office.
(8)  A $100.00 filing fee.
(c) Notice of public hearing.
At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Board of Adjustment   hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall give written notice of the variance to all adjacent  property owners.
Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States  mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as  submitted with the application.
The notice shall state the following information:        (1) The name of the applicant.
131   (2) The location of the property.
(3) The nature of the variance and the applicable zoning provisions.
(4) The time, date, and location of the Board hearing.
Public notice shall also be given, stating the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, and  additional notice shall be posted on the premises affected.

6.7   Stay:  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the           Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of the appeal shall           have been filed with him that, for reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his           opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed           otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or, on           application, by a court of record when due cause can be shown.
ARTICLE VII – VARIANCES     7.1   Authority:  The Board is authorized upon appeal in specified cases to grant variances from the           terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to           special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in              unnecessary hardship.
7.2   Filing Procedures:  A complete application for an appeal for variance accompanied by a           $100.00 application fee shall be filed with the Board.
7.3    Notice of Hearing:  Upon receipt of the completed application form and the appropriate fee, the          Secretary shall immediately place the said request upon the calendar for hearing, and shall give           proper notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3.
A-9   7.4   Standards of Variances:  Before any permit for a variance is issued, the Board shall make           written findings certifying compliance with the following specific rules:            1.
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or                  building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structure, or buildings in the                same district:            2.
That literal interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights                commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of the Zoning                Ordinance:            3.
That the special conditions do not result from actions of the applicant (self-imposed                 hardship);            4.
That granting of the variance will not confer any special privilege on the applicant that is                denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;            5.
That granting of the variance is in harmony with the intent and purposes of the Zoning                Ordinance;            6.
That the variance will not adversely affect surrounding property, the general neighborhood,                or the community as a whole;            7.
That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structure, or buildings in the same district,                and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts                shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
8.
That the variance will not allow the establishment of a use not permissible under the terms of                the Zoning Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication                prohibited by the terms of the ordinance in said district.
7.5   Hardship:  In proving that a hardship has been imposed on the property as a result of the strict           interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance, the following conditions cannot be considered pertinent           to the determination of a hardship:            1.
Proof that a variance would increase the financial return from the land.
2.
Personal hardship.
3.
Self-imposed hardship.
7.6   Minimum Variance:  In granting variances, the Board shall grant only the minimum variance           that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
7.7   Conditions and Safeguards:  In granting variances, the Board may require such conditions and           safeguards as deemed appropriate to insure that intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
A-10   7.8   Hearings and Determinations:  Hearings and determinations on appeals for variances shall           conform to the requirements set forth in Article IX.
7.9   Voidance of a Variance:  Failure of the applicant to conform to the conditions and safeguards           specified in the terms of the variance, shall be deemed a violation of the Zoning Ordinance and           voids the permit.
ARTICLE VIII – ORDINANCE INTERPRETATION     8.1   Authority:  The Board is authorized to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error           in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the           enforcement of this article or any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto.
8.2   Filing Procedures:  A complete application for an appeal for ordinance or map interpretation           accompanied by a $100.00 application fee shall be filed with the Board.
8.3   Notice of  Hearing:  Upon receipt of the completed application form and the appropriate fee, the          Secretary shall immediately place the said request upon the calendar for hearing, and shall give          proper notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3.
8.4   Standards for Interpretations:            1.
The interpretation should expand beyond the specific case being considered and thought of                as having general, city wide applicability.
2.
Interpretation does not convey the right of legislation – the intent of the ordinance must be                upheld.
Interpretations shall serve to clarify the intent of the ordinance and map, but in no                case shall result in revision of the terms of the ordinance or intent of the ordinance and                zoning map.

Appeals shall be heard in order of receipt of application; amended appeals           according to the date of amendment.

Principles.
Principles are statements of intent related to the character of the physical environment and     preferences for how Anniston should manage its land resources in the future.
They are used in con-    junction with the districts to help communicate preferences for how and where development or      redevelopment should or should not take place.
The districts have been created with these       principles in mind.

Priority investment areas are the focus for future development and will serve as catalysts for city-     wide reinvestment.
B. Infill development and redevelopment of underutilized and/or deteriorating sites take priority      over development in greenfield locations.
C. Downtown is “everyone’s neighborhood,” featuring a vibrant mix of businesses, residences, and      civic uses, and a distinctive character that is appealing to residents, visitors, and investors.
D. The city’s stable neighborhoods will be maintained.
E. The development of new residential areas and redevelopment of existing residential areas have      strong neighborhood qualities, including sidewalks, mixed housing types, parks, and easy       access to basic retail needs.
F. Development that includes a mix of uses (residential, commercial, civic, employment) both verti-     cally (within buildings) and horizontally (within sites) and is connected to existing urban areas is      encouraged.
G. The city’s historic assets are conserved and respected through future development.
H. More opportunities to walk, bike, and access public transportation are created.
I.
Quality design is emphasized for all uses to create an attractive, distinctive public (streets, side-     walks, parks, and street trees, etc.)
