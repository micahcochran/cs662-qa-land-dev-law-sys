id4,"Any use which is not prohibited in a runway protection zone as determined in a. above, is permitted within the runway protection zone, subject to compliance with applicable airport noise impact zone, airport height notification zone and zoning district regulations. 516.08. Airport noise impact zone and regulations. A. Zone establishment. There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map an airport noise impact zone for areas surrounding airport. The airport noise impact zone is an area in which special construction standards are recommended for new construction and alteration, moving and repair to minimize the impact of airport generated noise routinely produced by continuation of normal airport operations. The airport noise impact zone is defined as follows:  An area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (½) the length of the longest planned runway on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. For land use control purposes, this boundary shall be considered to be consistent with the sixty-five (65) to seventy (70) level day night (ldn) zone determined by an official Part 150 Noise Study or other recognized study, such as an Environmental Assessment, if a study is completed. B. Noise impact zone regulations. Provisions of this section shall apply to construction, alteration, moving, repair and use of any building or structure within the airport noise impact zone. 1. Applicants for building permits or permits granted by the Planning Department in the noise impact zone shall be provided information at the time of application regarding recommended amounts of noise level reduction (NLR) in the airport noise impact zone as established by this Ordinance as well as guidelines for how such noise reduction shall be achieved. 516.09. Nonconforming Uses. 1. Regulations not Retroactive. These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nonconforming vegetation is subject to removal per the provisions of § 516.12.6. 2. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to install, operate, and maintain thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport, Federal Aviation Administration, or State of Alabama, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such obstructions in accordance with FAA requirements. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the owner’s expense. 3. Expansion of a Nonconforming Use. Any existing nonconforming use as described in these regulations shall not be expanded by altering, replanting or otherwise enlarging it so as to increase in any way its hazard within the airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing or taking-off or to increase the potential hazard to persons assembled within a structure so located and used. 516.10. Permits. An applicant seeking development approval in an area within the airport overlay zones shall provide the following information in addition to any other information required in the permit application:  a. A map or drawing showing the location of the property in relation to the runway protection zone, height notification zone and noise impact zone. The City of Auburn Planning Department shall provide the applicant with the appropriate base maps on which to locate the property. V-83   b. Ground elevation profiles, a site plan, both drawn to scale, including the location (X and Y coordinates) and total height of all existing and proposed structures, measured in feet above the mean sea level. c. If a height variance is requested, the applicant will need to obtain a letter                    of support from the Airport. 516.11. Enforcement. The enforcement of this Section shall be subject to the powers and duties specified under Article IX of the zoning ordinance except as otherwise stated in this Section. The Planning Director and the Official Building Inspector shall coordinate the enforcement of this Section with the Airport. It shall be the duty of the Airport to advise the Planning Director and the Official Building Inspector of any violations of this Section. Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the City of Auburn Planning Department upon a form published for this purpose. Applications submitted to the Planning Department shall be promptly considered and approved or denied. Applications for variances by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be transmitted by the Planning Director. 516.12. Special Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no use within the City of Auburn shall interfere with any operation of an airborne aircraft using a public use airport. The following special requirements shall apply to proposed developments or land use practices that attract or sustain hazardous wildlife populations on or near airports that can significantly increase the potential for wildlife-aircraft collisions. 1. The distance between the Airport’s aircraft movement areas, loading ramps, or aircraft parking areas and the wildlife attractant should be a distance of 10,000 feet. A distance of 5 statute miles is recommended, if the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife movement into or across the approach or departure airspace. For additional information please consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration for standard practices for locating certain land uses having the potential to attract hazardous wildlife to or in the vicinity of public use airports. 2. Sludge disposal, effluent spraying, compost activities and any other waste disposa1 activities should normally not be allowed within the property limits of the Airport. 3. Disposal sites for putrescible material, i.e. garbage dumps, landfills, and other similarly licensed or titled facilities, are to be considered incompatible when located within 10,000 feet of the Airport’s runways. 4. Disposal sites for nonputrescible material, e.g. construction demolition waste, automobile junk yards, kitchen appliances, and incinerator ash residue, are normally considered incompatible to within 10,000 feet of a runway used by turbine powered aircraft. However, depending upon the specific proposal, the results of a site investigation, and the proposed location relative to the runway approach/departure paths, certain types of restricted nonputrescible disposal operations may be found non-objectionable off airport, provided assurances are obtained from the proponent, and included in the licensing process, that should the site cause an increase in bird activity which might be hazardous to safe aircraft operations, action will be taken to mitigate the hazard or close the site. V-84   5. Proposed developments which produce lights or illumination, smoke, glare or other visual hazards, or produce electronic interference with airport/airplane navigation signals are subject to the standards specified in the FAA Procedures Manual 7400-2C as may be applied and enforced by the state and/or federal governments. 6. Vegetation in the airport north-south approach zone or the airport northwest-southeast approach zone must be removed if said vegetation penetrates the approach surfaces. Section 517. Flag Lots. A flag lot is a lot that has minimal frontage on a publicly owned and maintained street, whose width some distance back from the street boundary line meets all Ordinance requirements. The purpose of flag lots is to reduce the number of direct access points to arterial and collector roads. Flag lots may be permitted, even though they do not meet the minimum lot width requirements at the street boundary line, subject to the following conditions:  A. Flag lots shall be limited to single family residential use only. No more than one (1) dwelling unit shall be authorized for any one (1) flag lot access strip. B. A flag lot may be used within a subdivision to provide a lot fronting on an arterial or collector road with access to an internal subdivision street. In such cases, vehicular access to the lot from the arterial or collector shall be prohibited. In any event, no more than 10 percent of the lots in any subdivision may be approved as flag lots. C. Flag lots providing access to arterial or collector roads shall be prohibited. D. Flag lot “stems” or access strips shall be at least 25 feet in width as measured at the road frontage. The land area within the access strip shall not count toward the following required minimum lot sizes:  District  Minimum Lot Size  Neighborhood Conservation (NC) 40,000 square feet, or greater if required by district sub-designation  Development District Housing (DDH) 40,000 square feet Redevelopment (RDD) 20,000 square feet Large Lot Residential (LLRD) 1 acre Rural (R)  3 acres Limited Development (LDD) 40,000 square feet Comprehensive Development (CDD) 40,000 square feet  E. Where otherwise consistent with the provisions of this section, flag lots may be created in groups not exceeding two (2); in such cases, access strips shall be adjacent to each other and form a total width of 50 feet. A distance of 500 feet shall separate non-adjacent flag lot access strips on the same side of the road. All access strips shall be at least 25 feet from an intersection. F. The Planning Director shall identify the front, side and rear lot lines of a flag lot for determining yard requirements, allowable locations of accessory structures, and other purposes. V-85   Section 518. Conservation Overlay District (COD). 518.01. Application of the Conservation Overlay District.

Building signs on any single development site shall not exceed a total of two (2) square feet per linear foot of the main or entry facade. Multi-story structures with outside entrances to businesses on each floor may multiply the allowable building signage area by the number of floors. Multi- story buildings with interior entrances and hotel/motel businesses are not allowed to apply the multiplier. Building signs on development sites located in the Urban Core (UC), the College Edge Overlay (CEOD), and the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) districts, shall be governed by the regulations listed below. Building signs on development sites located in the Corridor Redevelopment District – West (CRD- W), east of North Donahue Drive, shall be governed under the regulations set forth in Section 510. Prorating of allowable building signage amongst building tenants shall be the responsibility of the owner or property manager, not the Auburn Planning Department. A. Building Signs in the Urban Core, College Edge Overlay District, and Urban Neighborhood Districts. Building signs and sandwich board signs as defined in Article VI are the only signs that are allowed in the UC, CEOD, and UN districts. Signs may be attached to any building façade. In a multi-tenant building, the building owner is responsible for distributing the sign allowance among the tenants. Electronic reader boards are prohibited in the UC, CEOD, CRD-W, and UN districts. Single story building – Each building facade that faces a public street or that has the main entrance may have one (1) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building or space width, or sixteen (16) square feet, whichever is greater, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. Other building facades may have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building width, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. Multi-story building – Each building facade that faces a public street or that has the main entrance may have two (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building or space width or thirty-two (32) square feet, whichever is greater, but no more than seventy- five (75) square feet. Other building facades may have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square feet. Ground story nonresidential uses may have allowable signage area independent from that allowed for the multi-story building. Such uses with facades that face a public street may have two (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot of bay or thirty-two (32) feet, whichever is greater, but no more than seventy-five (75) feet. Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square feet can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade that has a sidewalk or entrance. A blade mounted sign is defined as an ornamental rod extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging sign suspended from it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street ROW. Blade signs are to be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above sidewalk level to the bottom of the blade sign. Text and graphics on either or both ends of an awning that are oriented perpendicular to the building face for pedestrian view and are no more than six (6) square feet may be provided in lieu of a blade sign. All building signs must be mounted between the first and second story line, or between the second and third story line or near the top of the wall. The Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate location for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause damage to architectural ornamentation of a building. In any case, building signs may not be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the primary sign is computed by measuring the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle, within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed. Text and graphics on the front of an awning oriented parallel to the building face are allowed and are considered building signage. A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being advertised, and is generally two (2) sided. VI-12  Sandwich board signs that meet all of the following criteria may be placed and displayed on a public sidewalk: 1. A height of no more than four (4) feet; 2. Maximum area of any side is eight (8) square feet; 3. No illumination; 4. Placed in front of the building or leased space during business hours respective to the use in the building or leased space; 5. Maintains a clearance on the sidewalk of at least five (5) feet; and, 6. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other sandwich board sign. Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side make it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich board spacing requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternative location that maximizes distance between adjacent signs. B. Building Signs in all other zoning districts. Building signs on any single development site shall not exceed a total of two (2) square feet per linear foot of the main or entry facade. Multi-story structures with outside entrances to businesses on each floor may multiply the allowable building signage area by the number of floors. Multistory buildings with interior entrances and hotel/motel businesses are not allowed to apply the multiplier. Prorating of allowable building signage amongst building tenants shall be the responsibility of the owner or property manager, not the Auburn Planning Department. 605.05. Multi-Family Residential Signs. Permits are required for all signs located on multi-family residential properties whether on a single lot or on multiple lots under the same ownership and/or management and/or development name. The following requirements apply to multi-family residential sites:  A. Wall Sign - 32 square feet; or, B. Freestanding Sign - 32 square feet. C. One sign of either type is allowed at each entrance from a public street or perimeter road. 605.06. Banners.

Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a roadway, the display area shall be the area of one sign face. Where a sign has two (2) or more faces that can be viewed from a single location or has an angle greater that 45 degrees, the display area of all such faces shall be included in determining the total display area of the sign. 607.04. Calculation of Display Area. The display area of a sign or advertising device is measured by the smallest square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the entire sign or advertising device; excluding trim, frame, apron, posts, uprights, braces or other structural members which support it. Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a roadway, the display area shall be the area of one sign face. Where a sign has two (2) or more faces that can be viewed from a single location, the display area of all such faces shall be included in determining the total display area of the sign. VI-15  Open-lettered sign display area shall be measured by the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle, within which all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed, multiplied by a factor of 0.8. When a sign is in the form of a three-dimensional object, the area shall be determined by drawing a square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the projected image of the sign and multiplying that area by two (2). The “projected image” is that image created by tracing the largest possible two-dimensional outline of the sign. 607.05. Relationship to Building Features. A. Signs mounted to the structural roof or applied to the roof including painted signs are prohibited. B. Window signs are exempt. C. Interior signs displayed in a manner that they are visible from a public right-of-way or adjoining properties are prohibited. (See also Window Signs). 607.06. Maintenance.

Vegetation must be properly maintained and no condition shall be allowed that would constitute a fire, safety, or health hazard. 607.07. Abandoned Signs. A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, any sign or sign structure identifying a previous use or activity that has not occupied the site for a period greater than sixty (60) days, does not maintain a current business license or pertains to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies, shall be deemed abandoned. Any abandoned sign shall be prohibited and shall be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner of the property within 60 days. The removal of a frame of an abandoned sign shall not be required, if it conforms to all applicable terms contained in these regulations (including the sign face area for sign replacement yielded by such frame). B. Any sign structure, which supported or supports an abandoned sign and which structure conforms to all applicable terms contained in these regulations shall be allowed to remain in place. However, in the event a sign structure which supported or supports an abandoned sign is inconsistent with any term contained in these regulations (including the sign face area for sign replacement yielded by the frame), then the sign structure and frame shall be either altered to comply with the terms contained herein or removed by the owner of such structure or property.

Banners are subject to the following requirements:  A. Each banner must have its own permit. B. Banners for a single address are limited to three (3) banners per calendar year. After three (3) permits have been issued, no additional permits shall be issued for the remainder of the calendar year. C. Display period for a banner permit shall not exceed 30 calendar days from the date of issuance of the permit or date of initial display. Periods of display without a valid banner permit will count against future banner permits and treated as a violation of this Ordinance. D. Banners must contain a message related to a business, profession, or activity conducted or to a commodity or service sold or offered, upon the premises where such sign is located. E. Banners shall be limited to a maximum size of 50 square feet. F. Community Decorations, as described in this Article, are exempt as long as they do not contain a commercial message. G. Banners must be attached to buildings or other structures on the property and cannot be attached to freestanding signs, utility poles, fences, or attached to or suspended between stakes or poles driven into the ground. VI-18 ARTICLE VII. NONCONFORMITIES. Section 700. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of legal uses, structures, lots, and signs established either prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or the effective date of future amendments to this Ordinance that no longer conform to the requirements of this Ordinance. All such situations are collectively referred to as ""nonconformities."" The zoning regulations established by this Ordinance are designed to guide the future use of land in the City of Auburn by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses, and thus, to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such regulations are established, and thus, the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable. With limited exceptions, the regulations of this article permit such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time, but are intended to restrict further investments which would make them more permanent. While nonconformities may continue, the provisions of this chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities to bring about their eventual improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this Ordinance and the character of the City. Any nonconforming use, structure, lot, or sign that lawfully existed as of the effective date of this Ordinance and that remains nonconforming, and any use, structure, lot, or sign that becomes nonconforming as a result of any subsequent rezoning or amendment to the text of this Ordinance, may be continued or maintained only in accordance with the terms of this chapter. This chapter also is intended to reduce vacancies, promote appropriate redevelopment and reuse of existing structures and lots, and set forth requirements. This Article distinguishes nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures, nonconforming development sites, nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming manufactured home parks, and nonconforming signs. Different regulations are made applicable to each of these categories. The degree of restriction made applicable to each separate category is a function of the degree to which that category of nonconformity is a nuisance or incompatible with the purposes and regulations of this Ordinance. Section 701. Definitions. 701.01. A legal nonconformity is any land use or physical design of development, structure, sign, or lot of record legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, which would not be permitted by or is not in full compliance with the regulations of this Ordinance. 701.02. A nonconforming use is an activity using land, buildings, and/or structures for purposes which were legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, and which would not be permitted to be established as a new use in a zone in which it is located by the regulations of this Ordinance. Once changed to a conforming use, no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. 701.03. A nonconforming structure is any building or structure, other than a sign, legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, which does not fully comply with the standards of this Ordinance. 701.04. A nonconforming development site is any development site, legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it and part of an approved site plan or subdivision plat at the time of its establishment, which does not fully comply with the standards of this Ordinance, including the minimum acceptable bufferyard requirements of Section 714. Noncompliance with the bufferyard requirements of Section 420 through Section 432 requires compliance with Section 714, but does not render a development site nonconforming. 701.05. A nonconforming lot of record is any validly recorded lot meeting the requirements of § 711.03 of the Zoning Ordinance, which at the time it was recorded fully, complied with all applicable laws and ordinances, but which does not fully comply with the lot requirements of this Ordinance concerning minimum area, minimum lot width, or minimum street frontage. VII-1   701.06. A nonconforming sign is any sign legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment to it which does not fully comply with all requirements of Article VI of this Ordinance. Section 702. Determination of Nonconforming Status. 702.01. The burden of establishing the nonconforming status of any structure or land use under the terms of this Article, in all cases, shall be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not upon the City of Auburn. 702.02. Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of an existing nonconformity are permitted but such nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 702.03. This chapter shall not apply, however, to any development standard or feature that is the subject of a variance or waiver granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, Historic Preservation Commission, Planning Commission, or City Council. Where a variance or waiver has been granted for a development standard that does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, that development standard shall be deemed conforming. Section 703. Termination of Nonconforming Status. 703.01. In the event that any structure containing a nonconforming use, nonconforming structure, nonconforming development site, or nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value at the time of loss, as determined by the Lee County Tax Assessor or licensed appraiser, such structure shall not be rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any purpose unless the structure and its development site shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. When such a nonconforming structure or development site is damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50 percent or less of its fair market value at the time of loss, no repairs or rebuilding shall be permitted except in conformity with this Article and other applicable regulations of this Ordinance. Such restoration shall be undertaken only under a valid building permit for which a complete application is submitted within 18 months following said damage, which permit must be actively pursued to completion. 703.02. In the event that any nonconforming use, structure containing a nonconforming use, or nonconforming structure, is proposed to be physically expanded or modified through a change in character, operation, or scale to the extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value, as determined by the Lee County Tax Assessor or licensed appraiser, such structure shall not be physically expanded or modified through a change in character, operation, or scale for any purpose unless the structure and its development site shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. 703.03. Any other provision of this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, no use or structure which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. For purposes of this paragraph, “ceased” or “terminated” shall mean that regular use or occupation of a structure has not occurred for more than twelve (12) consecutive months. Section 704. Review Process. 704.01 Continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a nonconforming use are permitted as defined in Section 705. 704.02. The reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or nonconforming site that houses a conforming use, and that meets the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03, shall use the permitted use in nonconforming structures process in Section 706. 704.03. Enlargement, expansion, alteration or major repair of a nonconforming structure or a conforming structure on a nonconforming site when such structure houses a nonconforming use, or when such structure houses a conforming use shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in Section 707 and Section 714 of this Ordinance and also the requirements of this section. Enlargements, expansions, alterations and major repairs are all of those actions that do not meet the provisions of Section 705 or Section 706. VII-2   704.04. Enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in Section 708 of this Ordinance and also the requirements of this section. 704.05. Site Plans Site plans may be required for activities falling under the provisions of Section 704.2. Site plans shall be required for activities falling under the provisions of Section 704.03 and Section 704.04 Section 705. Continuation, Maintenance, and Minor Repair. 705.01. The continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a nonconforming use are permitted, provided that the continuation, maintenance, or minor repair does not extend or expand the nonconforming use or structure, except in accordance with Section 705. For the purposes of this section, ""maintenance or minor repair"" shall mean:  A. Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure;  B. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses; and  C. Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety as determined by the Codes Enforcement division (does not apply to damage or destruction governed by Section 703.01). C. Incidental alterations (see Section 203), including: a. Internal reconfigurations of an existing building that do not meet the definition of an alteration (alterations must be approved through Section 707);  b. Limited modifications to an existing building façade, such as recladding or repainting c. Addition or substitution of an awning or awnings;  d. Modifications or additions to approved landscaping;  705.02. In the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a period of twelve (12) months or more, or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure or premises is located, the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such structure or premise is located. Section 706. Permitted Uses in Nonconforming Structures. 706.01. The reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or conforming structure on a nonconforming site shall not be required to acquire conditional use approval or undergo the typical DRT review procedure if the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03 below are met. Owners of such properties may be issued a zoning certificate after staff review of the proposed reuse or redevelopment. Reuse and redevelopment that does not qualify for consideration under this section may instead utilize the process in Section 707 for review and approval. 706.02. Intent. The intent of this process is to encourage the utilization of existing nonconforming buildings and sites as opposed to their remaining vacant while at the same time reducing such nonconformities to the extent practical. The process allows owners to make improvements to an existing structure or site without having to go through a lengthy review process, produce a detailed site plan, reach compliance with all provisions of this Ordinance, or make roadway improvements. VII-3   706.03 Eligibility Requirements To qualify for issuance of a zoning certificate under Section 706, the following conditions must exist: 1. The proposed use is permitted within the zoning district. 2. The redeveloped use will occupy an existing building(s) on the site, with no expansions or additions proposed. 3. The site will add no more than 1,000 square feet of additional impervious surface. 4. The proposed new use does not expand existing encroachments into required buffers. 5. The site will be in compliance with the provisions of Article VI, Signs. 706.04 Limitations Proposals which do not meet the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03 are required to undergo the normal DRT review process and/or the conditional use process in cases of expansion or major alteration. Proposals for nonconforming sites or structures that have been vacant for less than twelve (12) months and do not involve, either proposed or required, any changes to the site or exterior of the structure (changes listed under Section 705 are exempted) shall be reviewed during the zoning certificate issuance process for compliance with the approved site plan or ordinance requirements in effect at the time it was established. If one (1) or more aspects of the site and/or structure fail to comply with the applicable plan approval or ordinance requirements, the deficiencies shall be corrected and the Planning Director must verify compliance prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Proposals involving a change in use that, although may be permitted within the underlying zoning district, will increase the intensity of the use(s) originally approved, will be required to demonstrate compliance with the current Ordinance requirements applicable to the proposed change prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate and/or certificate of occupancy. Demonstrating compliance can be accomplished either through the site plan review or Section 706 process, whichever is applicable. 706.05. Plan Submittal Requirements Issuance of a zoning certificate under this section may require submission of the following information, upon request of staff: 1. Landscaping and/or fencing compliant with Section 714, Minimum Acceptable Bufferyards; and 2. Off-street parking/parking lot design (dimensional standards and standard specifications); and 3. Screening of dumpsters, storage, heating and air conditioning, and similar equipment; and 4. Building improvements (painting or other changes); and 5. Access roads and entrances or exit drives to ensure automotive and pedestrian safety and traffic flow; and  706.06. Conditions The Planning Director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and the general public. 706.07. Exceptions for Required Improvements The Director of Planning and/or the Engineering Services Director may waive, in part or in full, certain required improvements if meeting them is deemed impractical or unreasonable given the constraints on the existing site. Consideration may also be given to the extent of the required improvements in relation to the specific nature and scope of the reuse/redevelopment proposal. Section 707. Administrative Review and Approval. Enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconforming structure, use or site shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section. VII-4   707.01. Site plans as required in Section 704.05 shall be submitted for review by the Planning Director or his designee. Site plans must meet the requirements of Section 802.12 of this Ordinance. The Planning Director or his designee shall determine whether to approve the proposed enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair. The Planning Director or his designee shall not approve the proposed activity unless and until it is found, based on the submitted site plan, that the proposed enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair meets the standards of review set forth in Section 802.05, Review Procedures, of this Ordinance, as well as the following:  1. The nonconforming use allowed to continue remains compatible with adjacent land uses and the Future Land Use Plan; 2. That all access roads and entrance or exit drives to the nonconformity will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control and access in the case of fire or other emergency; 3. That all off-street parking, loading, refuse collection, and other service areas will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and economic, noise, glare, odor, and other impacts on adjoining properties; 4. That all water, wastewater treatment, schools, fire and police protection, and other necessary public and private utilities and services will be adequate with respect to their location, availability, and compatibility with adjoining properties; 5. That all landscaping, screening, and fencing will be adequate, with respect to the effectiveness of their type, dimensions, and character, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the economic, noise, glare, odor, and other impacts of the nonconformity on adjoining properties and other properties in the neighborhood; 6. That the type, size, and intensity of the proposed use, including such considerations as storage of items and arrangement, the size of the site and the location of the use upon it, and the hours of operation and numbers of people who are likely to utilize or be attached to the use, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the impact of the nonconformity upon adjoining properties, other properties in the neighborhood, and the purposes of the zoning district in which the property is located; and 7. Surface drainage will be adequate with respect to on-site and off-site erosion, siltation, pollution, flooding, or other detrimental effects of the nonconformity. 707.02. Other Considerations In determining whether the proposed extension, alteration, or major repair will substantially injure the use and enjoyment of other properties, the Planning Director or his designee shall also consider and balance:  1. The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the nonconformity resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving the request; 2. The possible detriment or benefit to the owners of nearby properties resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving the request; and 3. The possible detriment or benefit to the general public resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving the request. 707.03. Conditions  The Planning Director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and the general public. VII-5   707.04. Limits on Expansion If the Planning Director or his designee permits a nonconforming structure or use to expand, then the following shall apply:  1. The area of such expansion shall not exceed 25 percent of the area of the existing nonconforming use or structure, unless otherwise allowable in this Section; 2. Telecommunications towers may be expanded by more than 25 percent to permit the co-location of a second or subsequent user or communications sending or receiving device so that the need for an additional tower is eliminated. Only the City Council may permit the expansion of a non-conforming telecommunications tower in districts in which it is not a permitted use. 707.05 Limits on Requirements In acting upon applications submitted under Section 707, the Planning Director or his designee shall not order the discontinuation or termination of nonconformity. If an application is denied, then the continuation, maintenance, and minor repair of the nonconformity shall still be allowed in accordance with the terms of this Article. Section 708. Enlargement or Expansion of Conditional Uses. Enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section. 708.01. Process for Approval The process for conditional use approval shall be in two parts: 1. Approval of the conditional use shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 803 of this Ordinance, requiring Planning Commission review and City Council approval. 2. Approval of the enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconforming structure, use or site shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth Section 707  Section 709. Exceptions for Residential Setbacks Certain additions to existing, nonconforming single-, two-, three-, or multi-family or townhouse dwellings may extend into a required front, side, or rear yard setback when the existing dwelling is already legally nonconforming with respect to that setback. The nonconforming portion shall be at least 60 percent of the total width of the respective wall of the structure prior to the addition. Additions may extend up to the height limit of the zoning district and extend into the required front, side and/or rear yard setback as follows:  1. Front and rear yard setbacks: The addition may extend five feet into the required front or rear yard setback or to the extent of the setback line formed by the nonconforming portion, whichever is less. 2. Side yard setbacks: The addition may extend into the required side yard setback up to the setback line formed by the nonconforming wall, except in no case shall the addition be closer than 5 feet from the side property line. Furthermore, the size of the addition shall be limited to an additional wall surface area within the required side setback area of no more than 200 square feet. Section 710. Exceptions for Historic Resources  In an effort to promote and encourage the preservation and adaptive reuse of locally designated resources, the Planning Director or his designee may grant certain waivers to the zoning code provided that it will result in the preservation of a locally designated property, after review and approval by the Historic Preservation Commission. The Planning Director, or his designee, may authorize certain waivers to the requirements of the underlying zoning district, to the extent indicated herein. VII-6   1. Any building that is individually locally designated or is classified as a contributing building within a local historic district, as identified in the contributing resources report, shall be permitted to be repaired, restored, structurally altered, or reconstructed, notwithstanding any conflicts with provisions of the underlying zoning district requirements pertaining to minimum lot size, setbacks, minimum lot width, FAR, open space, off-street parking or loading requirements. In cases where the configuration of a locally designated property, or a contributing property within a locally designated historic district precludes reasonable and appropriate use of the property within the underlying zoning district a waiver of up to twenty percent (20%) from the underlying requirements for setbacks, FAR, and open space may be authorized by the Planning Director or his designee. 2. Any contributing historic resource or building will not be limited to the valuation clause for nonconformities. 3. In cases where the size or configuration of a locally designated property, or a contributing property within a locally designated historic district is such that compliance with off-street parking requirements would destroy the historic character of the property, the Planning Director or his designee may authorize a reduction of up to one hundred percent (100%) of the number of parking spaces that would ordinarily be required for a new structure of equivalent use and floor area. Such a reduction will be granted only when it can be demonstrated that:  a. Granting the modification will further the preservation of the historic and architectural character of the historic resource, or of the historic district in which the proposal is located. b. Granting the modification would promote the preservation of the historic resource or historic district while reducing nonconformities. c. Granting the modification would help minimize or mitigate any potential adverse effect of a specific proposal whose implementation promotes the preservation of the historic resource or historic district. d. Special circumstances exist such as adjacencies or shared parking that will practically alleviate concerns for off-street parking. The Planning Director, or his designee, shall make specific findings that establish how the criteria have been met. Additionally, staff may impose any conditions, restrictions, or limitations deemed appropriate in order to ensure compliance with the criteria set forth above. Section 711. Nonconforming Lots of Record. 711.01. Subject to the provisions of this Section, a nonconforming lot of record may be used for any principal use permitted or conditional, provided approval from City Council, in the zone in which the lot is located, provided that for any use which is to be served by an individual well and/or septic system, the nonconforming lot shall be of a size and design to meet the minimum requirements of the Lee County Health Department regulations for such wells and septic systems. 711.02. Performance residential developments shall be prohibited on development sites smaller than the minimum sizes established in Section 502.02. If permitted in the applicable zoning district, single family dwelling units may be constructed on nonconforming lots of record at least 4,000 square feet in size and 50 feet in width. Adjoining lots, which are combined to form one (1) parcel shall be considered to meet this standard. 711.03. Minimum lot sizes for nonresidential uses are established in Table 4-3. To qualify as a nonconforming lot of record under this section, lots must have been platted prior to or in the year 1984 or be smaller than the following sizes:  Rural District (R)  40,000 s.f. Industrial District (I) 10,000 s.f. Other Districts1  7,500 s.f. In addition to the requirements of the previous sentence, a nonconforming lot must be have fully complied with all applicable laws and ordinances at the time it was recorded, but currently does not fully comply with the lot requirements of this Ordinance concerning minimum area, minimum lot width, or minimum street frontage. Where a lot meets the required minimum size for the district but not for a particular use category as specified in Table 4-3 (i.e., road service use        1However, no minimum lot size is required in the Urban Core (UC) District. VII-7   requires 30,000 s.f.) it shall not be considered a nonconforming lot of record. The lot shall instead be used for another development type for which it is eligible, based on its size. Property which qualifies as a nonconforming lot of record under this Section shall be eligible for any land use category having a minimum size requirement of 40,000 s.f. in the Rural (R) district, 10,000 square feet in the Industrial (I) district, and 7,500 s.f. in all others, as established in Table 4-3. 711.04. No nonresidential use(s) shall be permitted on nonconforming lots of record less than 6,000 square feet in size and 60 feet in width unless the Board of Zoning Adjustment grants a variance. Variances granted under this section shall not be use specific but rather granted for the required lot size and width for a particular use. Section 712. Nonconforming Uses  In the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a one (1) year period or more, or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure or premises is located, the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such structure or premise is located. 712.01. Change of Use Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use by securing all approvals and permits that this Ordinance requires for the intended or resulting use. No nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use. Section 713. Manufactured Home Parks  713.01. Existing manufactured home parks, which are nonconforming by use, shall not be redesigned, expanded in area, or modified to accommodate additional manufactured homes. 713.02. Manufactured home parks which are properly zoned and which are nonconforming by design only may be expanded in area and/or modified so as to reduce or eliminate those aspects of design, which render it nonconforming. The Planning Commission may authorize additional manufactured home sites in such parks upon submission of a site plan, consistent with the standards of Section 802, showing a redesign of the park, which substantiates the following:  A. The overall density of the park will not exceed seven (7) units per acre. B. A 20-foot wide residential buffer shall be provided along all development site boundaries (See Section 426.03, Residential Buffer Landscaping Requirements). C. No new manufactured home will be placed within 20 feet of any property line. D. Where possible, all development standards of Section 502.02(G) have been met, or the degree of nonconformity reduced. In no case shall the degree of nonconformity of any design aspect be increased. A redesign proposal that does not include the addition of new manufactured home spaces shall not be subject to conditions A and B above. Any redesign proposal shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. 713.03. The replacement of an existing manufactured home shall be allowed, provided that such replacement does not increase any degree of existing nonconformity (e.g. setbacks). VII-8   Section 714. Minimum Acceptable Bufferyard. Subsequent to the discontinuance of a nonconforming use, a development site, which is nonconforming by physical design, may be utilized for any activity or use which is otherwise permitted by this Ordinance. However, as a condition of approval of any enlargement, reconfiguration or any type of new development on the site, certain improvements must be made pursuant to this Section. When nonconformity is a result of noncompliance with the bufferyard required by Article IV of this Ordinance and the subject property is physically unable, because of its limited land area, to meet normal bufferyard requirements, the following requirements shall be met:  A. In no case shall bufferyard requirements less than those provided in Figure 7-1 be applied to the site. B. Where an anchor tenant (40,000 square feet of gross floor area or larger) of a shopping center has been replaced, full compliance with the bufferyard requirements of Article IV shall result. When such alterations shall result in a nonconformity with the provisions of this Ordinance (i.e., required parking), or an increase in an already nonconforming aspect of the Ordinance, the site shall conform to subsection A, above. C. If in the judgment of the Planning Director and City Engineer, subsection B cannot be met, then upon evaluation of the size and other relevant characteristics of a site, bufferyard width and planting requirements may be prorated as appropriate, in consultation with the Planning Commission. Section 715. Nonconforming Signs. A nonconforming sign is any sign within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Auburn on the effective date of this Article or any sign existing within any area annexed into such jurisdiction after the effective date of this Article which is prohibited by, or does not conform to the requirements of Article VI of this Ordinance. Nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition. However, such signs shall:  A. not be structurally altered to accommodate another nonconforming sign or sign face; B. not be structurally altered in order to prolong the life of the sign, except to meet safety requirements as specified by the Chief Building Official or City Engineer; C. not be altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign (including additional or replacement sign faces); D. not be enlarged in any manner; E. not be allowed to remain if a change of use occurs as defined by this ordinance, or if the premises promoted by the sign comes under new ownership or tenancy and such sign is proposed to be remodeled, repainted, have the face replaced or otherwise changed for the purpose of displaying the new name or other new identification of the premises; or  F. not be re-established after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction or repair exceeds 50 percent of the appraised replacement cost. This cost shall be exclusive of any expected or estimated revenue generated by the sign. G. be removed if the sign or sign structure identifying a previous use or activity that has not occupied the site for a period greater than sixty (60) days, does not maintain a current business license or pertains to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies. The owner of the sign or owner of the property shall have 60 days to remove the sign. VII-9   Section 716. Appeal Process. Any person aggrieved or affected by the provisions of Article VII of this Ordinance may appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for relief in accordance with the provisions of Section 908 of this Ordinance.

DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS Section 800. Purpose. This Article sets forth the procedures required for obtaining development approval within the City of Auburn. Site plans, subdivisions, conditional uses, zoning certificates, and certificates of occupancy are addressed herein. However, the approval of a development under the provisions of this Article does not imply any variation or waiver of any provisions of the building code, housing code, fire code, or any other applicable code, standard, or regulation adopted by the City of Auburn, the State of Alabama, or the United States Government. Section 801. Subdivisions. Any subdivision or resubdivision of land, or combining of lots within the City of Auburn, and within unincorporated areas lying within three (3) miles of the Auburn city limits, shall be carried out in accordance with the Auburn Subdivision Regulations, the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual, and the Water Resource Management Department Design and Construction Manual, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Ordinance. All development within subdivisions shall be consistent with applicable sections of this Ordinance. Section 802. Site Plans. 802.01. Intent and Purpose. This Section shall apply to all site plans as defined in Article II. The site plan procedures shall be required in order to ensure that site-specific development projects meet the requirements of this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate authorizing a building permit. It is the intent of this Section that the site plan review process be a part of the building permit application process, and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the site will be constructed and inspected prior to occupancy of the development. 802.02. Development Requiring Site Plan Approval. Prior to issuance of a zoning certificate, site plan approval shall be required for all proposed non-residential construction, as well as residential development types described in Sections 502.02 (F), (G), and (H). This shall include clubhouses or other ancillary facilities within a residential subdivision. Site plan approval shall also be required for the subdivision of an existing development site of a type subject to site plan requirements, and/or an expansion, reduction or reconfiguration of any such development type. For any proposal in which these requirements are unclear, the Planning Director shall determine whether site plan approval is necessary. 802.03. Review of Site Plans. Site plans submitted for review shall be approved, disapproved, or referred to the Planning Commission. Site plan review shall be in accordance with Section 1.0 – General Information of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. In approving a site plan, any request for waivers from the requirements of this Ordinance shall be taken to the Planning Commission for consideration as provided in Section 802.04. The following criteria shall be used in determining whether to approve a site plan: A. Completeness of application information as required under Section 802.12; B. Consistency with adopted policies and standards of the Major Streets and Utilities Master Plans; C. Uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this Ordinance; D. Whether the site plan meets applicable design standards established by this Ordinance; VIII-1 E. Availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development, such as roads, sewer, water, schools, solid waste disposal, and fire protection (including access to the site for emergency vehicles); and  F. Compatibility with surrounding land uses (this criterion shall apply only where a site plan proposes a conditional use pursuant to Section 803). The Planning Director and/or City Engineer may refer any site plan proposal to the Planning Commission. 802.04. Waiver of Selected Development Standards – Approval by Planning Commission. Specific development standards that may be modified with Planning Commission Approval are limited to the following: bufferyards, including width, planting and required structures; and general and off-street parking landscaping requirements. This may be done only upon a specific finding by the Planning Commission that such requirements are inappropriate as applied to a particular development site due to its size, proposed use, and/or location, and that a waiver would not conflict with the intent of this Ordinance or confer upon any property owner a right or privilege denied to neighboring property owners within the same district. 802.05. Review Procedures. Site plan applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Planning Director and staff prior to formal submission of a site plan for review. At the applicant’s request, a pre- application conference shall be held, at which time planning staff members will provide the applicant with advice and guidance regarding the requirements of this Ordinance, and any other regulations which apply. Preliminary sketches shall be reviewed and overall development concepts finalized at this time. It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to request the pre-application conference and any other available guidance in sufficient time to prepare a complete application package. Site plan submittals shall be in accordance with Section 1.0 – General Information of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. A. Site Plan Preparation Requirements. Where the proposed development site is three (3) acres in size or larger, the site plan shall be prepared and sealed by an architect, professional engineer or surveyor. At the Planning Directors discretion, the same requirement may be applied to sites of less than three (3) acres where the plan proposes high-intensity uses or activities that may have a substantial impact on surrounding properties. Sketch plans and drawings submitted with variance or other zoning-related applications shall not be accepted for review as a site plan unless they are prepared in accordance with the guidelines of this Section and contain all required information. In all cases, engineering plans addressing drainage, road construction and other technical aspects of development design shall be sealed by a civil engineer registered in the State of Alabama. B. Development Site Requirements. For development sites of one (1) acre or more, full engineering drawings or a Project Engineer’s Statement must be submitted by an engineer registered in the State of Alabama. The City Engineer may choose to require additional information as necessary. C. Completeness of Plans. Site plans submitted without complete information in accordance with Section 802.12 shall not be reviewed by the Planning Staff or placed on the Planning Commission Agenda. D. Staff Review. The Planning Director and other appropriate city staff members shall review the site plan with specific regard to this Ordinance and other regulations of the City of Auburn. The staff review shall identify matters of development policy concern to which the applicant shall address particular attention. VIII-2 E. Revised Plans. Following submission of a complete application package for site plan review the Planning staff shall have 15 working days in which to complete the review and approve the site plan. For site plans that must go before the Planning Commission, at such time as the Planning Commission determines that all staff comments have been adequately addressed, and that the requirements of all applicable City, State and Federal regulations have been met, it shall approve the site plan. 802.06. Approval of Site Plans. Except as stipulated in Section 802.04, no site plan shall be approved which is inconsistent with any term contained in this Ordinance unless a variance has been authorized in accordance with Section 907 of this Ordinance. 802.07. Effect of Site Plan Approval. Approved site plans shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval, and a zoning certificate and building permit for the development may be obtained during that time period. The Planning Director may make an extension of site plan approval for a single period up to six (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire. An extension may be granted only if the Planning Director concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 days before the expiration of the approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension request. Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this Section. Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction drawings to the Engineering Services and Inspection Services Departments for permitting. These shall include, but are not limited to, detailed building plans, grading plans, drainage and stormwater management facilities, erosion control plans, road and driveway construction specifications, and tree removal plans. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Inspection Services Department from accepting for review and processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions as may be established by that department relative to processing of site plans prior to final approval. In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a zoning certificate and the site plan has been stamped approved and is on file in the office of the Inspection Services Department. All building and construction permits issued for any project requiring site plan review shall be consistent with the stamped approved site plan. The approval of a site plan shall not under any circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the applicable City requirements for construction or installation of structures or materials. Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such construction details occurs, the more restrictive or that requiring the higher standard shall prevail. 802.08. Modification or Termination of Site Plans. A. Site Plan Amendments. After final approval, any modification, variation or adjustment of a stamped approved site plan shall require approval of a site plan amendment. Upon approval of any amendment, the Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall stamp and date the most recent version of the site plan, showing the approved amendment, and mark all previous copies as “void”. If appropriate, the Engineering and Inspection Services Departments shall be notified of the amendment. B. Site Plan Expiration and Cancellation. In the event of a change to these regulations the site plan shall be valid under the regulations for which it was approved for 18 months from the date of such approval. Upon expiration of the site plan and any extension that VIII-3 may have been granted, the Planning Director shall make appropriate records in the Planning Department files stamp all available copies of the site plan as “void”, and notify the Engineering and Codes Enforcement Divisions of the expiration. The applicant may cancel the site plan at any time between the date of final approval and the date of expiration by submitting a written request to the Planning Director. Upon receipt of this request by the Planning Director, the site plan shall be treated as expired. 802.09. Integration of Other Review Procedures. Any site plan to be built in stages or requiring variance or conditional use approval shall be coordinated as set forth below:  A. Development Built in Stages. As part of the application for site plan approval, the developer shall submit a proposed staging of development plan, including a schedule for completion of all improvements pursuant to Section 505.02. If the site plan proposes any of the performance residential housing types described in Section 502.02 (A) through (G), a Master Development Plan pursuant to Section 505 shall also be required. Once a site plan for a stage has been approved, no land may be used and no building may be occupied except in accordance with such plan. A new site plan is required for each successive stage of the development. Stage configurations shall be logical and consistent with the purposes of this Ordinance. If appropriate, the Planning Director may stipulate that any or all portions of the required landscaping and/or bufferyards be provided during the first stage of development, even though some bufferyards or portions thereof lie outside the stage. Each stage, at a minimum, must include adequate parking, drainage facilities, landscaping, and all other features needed to serve that portion of the total development (See Sections 505.02 and 505.06). Prior to approval for construction of any one stage, an engineering stage plan shall be submitted to and approved by the City Engineer. This plan shall address site grading, erosion control, stormwater management, internal traffic circulation, and any other design elements required by the City Engineer. In approving a stage plan, the Planning Commission or Planning staff may specify certain site improvements to be provided at a percentage rate exceeding that of construction of the overall development. These items may be elements of engineering design, or requirements of this Ordinance. Such improvements include, but are not limited to parking, drainage facilities, erosion control measures, landscaping and bufferyards. Where the applicant has agreed to provide off-site improvements, such as traffic signals, turn lanes, and sewer lines, the City Engineer may require such improvements to be in place upon completion of any stage of the development. B. Variance. Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. This shall include existing development sites, proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance. The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved. C. Conditional Uses. For developments requiring approval of a conditional use, a request for such approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission and City Council, and the conditional use shall be approved prior to final approval of the site plan. A site plan and a conditional use request may be processed concurrently. VIII-4 802.10. Non-Compliance. Failure to comply with a stamped approved site plan or any of the conditions upon which such approval was contingent, including time limits for performance, shall be cause to deny issuance of a zoning certificate or, where a zoning certificate has been issued pursuant to a stamped approved site plan, to render such zoning certificate invalid. Any action, construction, development or use of property undertaken in violation of the provisions of this Section for a site plan shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and may be subject to a stop-work order. 802.11. Development Site to Be Unified. A. Internal Division of Ownership. Except as provided in this section, the development site shall remain unified by title under one (1) owner, or by multiple owners holding a percentage interest in the site as a whole. Where a development site consists of two (2) or more existing lots under the same ownership, all such lots shall be combined in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations prior to final approval of the site plan. Where spatial division of ownership within a development site is proposed, the owners of all component properties shall accept the following conditions in receiving site plan approval:  1. No individual property will be used or developed in any way that is not consistent with the approved site plan. 2. Development rights on each parcel are combined with those of the balance of the development site, and the City will consider no separate development proposals unless the development site can be divided in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 3. No parcel of land within a development site shall be subdivided, sold or otherwise conveyed for the purpose of new development that is not authorized under the approved site plan. All owners of property within the development site shall authorize one (1) person, designated as the applicant, to represent them collectively before the Planning Commission and other City officials in all matters related to the site plan and development site. B. External Ownership. When the development site is part of a larger parcel of property, of which a portion is not intended to be included within the site plan, this unused area shall become a separate lot, meeting any relevant size and dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, to be approved in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations. This subdivision process shall be completed prior to final approval of the site plan. C. Development Site to Be Complete. The development site shall be designed to provide all required amenities and facilities, including bufferyards, open space, landscaping; no such required features shall be located off-site or on adjacent properties which are leased, rented, or otherwise proposed for use on an informal basis, except as provided for in Section 509.02. The entire site shall have the zoning designation required to accommodate the principal use. D. Division After Approval. No development site, once granted site plan approval, shall be divided except through the site plan amendment process established in Section 802.08. 802.12. Site Plan Preparation Requirements. A site plan must accurately show all relevant information about a proposed development to permit it to be reviewed against the requirements of this Ordinance, and to provide a permanent record as to the type and characteristics of development approved on the site. Site plans shall be drawn, on an overall sheet size not to exceed 24 by 36 inches, to one of the following scales:  VIII-5  1”:10’  1”:20’  1”:30’  1”:40’  1”:50’  1”:60’  1”:100’ When more than one (1) sheet is needed, a series of drawings showing different elements of the site design, such as landscaping, utilities, or topography may be submitted. Where such a series is submitted, the top sheet shall include an index of all other sheets in the series. These shall be bound in a single package, with each sheet labeled as to what it shows and its number in the series (e.g., Landscaping Plan, Sheet 2 of 3)  Unless specifically waived by the Planning Director, the following information shall be shown on all site plans:  A. Written Information:  1. Site plan name. 2. General statement indicating the character of the use(s) proposed for the site. This shall include information describing the size and/or intensity of the use, such as the number of employees at largest shift, seating capacity, number of students, number of hospital beds or motel rooms, etc. All other relevant information not otherwise specified in this checklist shall be provided in the General Statement, such as variances on the property, nonconforming status, etc. 3. Property owner’s name, address and telephone number; and the designated project applicant or representative if other than the property owner. 4. Name, address, and telephone number of engineer, surveyor, architect, landscape architect and/or any other professional involved in design of the project. 5. Total size of the tract expressed in square feet and acres (to nearest tenth). 6. Zoning district assigned to the subject property. 7. Zoning and current land use of adjacent properties. 8. Number of units proposed (residential only). 9. Impervious surface area in square feet, impervious surface ratio (ISR), maximum and proposed. 10.

Items to be Submitted to Engineering Department:  1. Items to be submitted shall be in accordance with Section 1.0 – General Information of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. Section 803. Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are those uses that have some special impact which differs from the potential impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have a uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a particular location. Upon submission of a request for conditional use approval, a review of the location, design, configuration, and impact shall be conducted to determine whether the proposed use would have a detrimental impact on neighboring properties. The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by the proposed use; whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is consistent with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and any other development policies and/or regulations of the City of Auburn; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and welfare in general. 803.01. Applicability. Any use designated as a conditional use by Table 4-1 of this Ordinance shall comply with this Section. In addition, the following shall be approved only as conditional uses:  A. Any performance residential use (except Manufactured home parks, which are not allowed) in the Corridor Redevelopment District, Urban (CRD-U) and Suburban (CRD- S), and Multiple Unit Development in the Corridor Redevelopment District, West (CRD- W) and East (CRD-E), and Planned Development District (PDD). 803.02. Procedures. Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted and approved prior to application for a zoning certificate. A subdivision plat or a site plan meeting the requirements of Section 802 shall support applications for conditional uses in all districts. Site plan or subdivision approval shall not be granted prior to or contingent upon conditional use approval. The Planning Director shall process applications for a conditional use permit as follows:  A. Applications for a conditional use permit must be submitted to the Planning Director 23 days prior to the public hearing, as required in Section 803.02 (B). Copies of the application shall be distributed to the appropriate department heads. VIII-8  B. A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission after adjoining property owners have been notified of the public hearing by certified mail and signs announcing the public hearing have been erected on the property in question. Not later than five (5) days prior to the date set for the hearing on the application, the Planning Director shall file a written report thereon with the Planning Commission. C. The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds that the application and record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance. Further, the application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any mitigating conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission, outweigh any public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall public health, safety, and welfare. D. In order to prevent or minimize adverse effects on other properties in the neighborhood and on the general health, safety, and welfare of the City of Auburn, the Planning Commission may impose such restrictions and conditions on approval of the proposed use as it determines are required by the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this Ordinance. All conditions imposed upon any conditional use permit approval, except those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting such conditional use permits. E. Within 35 days of the public hearing on the application, unless an extension of this time is agreed to by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall render to the City Council its recommendation either to grant the application for a conditional use permit, grant it subject to conditions, or deny it. The failure of the Planning Commission to act within this time period shall constitute a recommendation by it that the application be approved. Within 60 days of the Planning Commission rendering its recommendation to the City Council, the City Council shall take action on the application, otherwise the application shall fail. The City Council may elect to grant an extension for good cause. Following a public hearing, the City Council shall either approve, or disapprove, the application and shall establish the specific conditions under which the application is approved. F. In the event a permit for a conditional use is approved or approved subject to conditions, the applicant shall submit a site plan meeting all conditions of approval. The Planning Director shall then take action to process the application on the zoning certificate for the development to which the conditional use permit applies. In the event such permit is not approved or is approved subject to conditions that are not acceptable to the applicant, the applicant may, within the aforesaid time period, either appeal such decision or abandon the application. 803.03. Conditions on Conditional Use Approvals. Every conditional use permit shall be contingent upon the proposed development fully complying with all requirements of this Ordinance and, where applicable, with the Subdivision Regulations. The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 803.04. General Use Standards. No application for a conditional use permit shall be approved unless the City Council shall specifically find the proposed conditional use appropriate in the location for which it is proposed. This finding shall be based on the following criteria:  A. The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and standards of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City. VIII-9 B. The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety, and general welfare; either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development. C. The proposed use will be adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden on any of the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection. Where any such improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part of the application and as a condition to approval of the proposed conditional use permit, be responsible for establishing ability, willingness, and bind commitment to provide such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services in sufficient time and in a manner consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, programs, maps, and ordinances adopted by the City to guide its growth and development. The approval of the conditional use permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services being provided and guaranteed by the applicant. D. The Planning Commission may attach recommendations for conditional use approval, additional criteria dealing with bufferyards, parking, lighting, building materials, or any other aspect of site plan approval necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed conditional use on the surrounding property. 803.05. Effect of Conditional Use Approval. Upon final approval of a conditional use permit, no structures, uses or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development site except in accordance with the site plan approval process as set forth in Section 802. Conditional use permits shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval. The City Council, upon recommendation by the Planning Commission, may make an extension of conditional use permit approval for a single period of up to six (6) months from the date when a conditional use permit would otherwise expire. An extension may be granted only if the City Council concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 days before the expiration of the conditional use permit stating the reason for the time extension request. Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this section. Section 804. Zoning Certificates. No development permitted by this Ordinance, including accessory and temporary uses, may be established and no existing building may be altered with respect to its use after the effective date of this Ordinance until a zoning certificate has been secured from the Planning Director. Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the additional responsibility of seeking any permit required by any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulations in compliance with all of the terms of this Ordinance. Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other ordinances. The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 804.01. Application Requirements for Zoning Certificates. All applications for zoning certificates shall be made in writing by the owner or developer of the property for which it is sought. The application shall be filed with the Planning Director and include two (2) copies of the following: VIII-10  A. Legal description of the parcel(s) for which the certificate is sought. B. Conditional Use Permit, if required (Section 803). C. Request for site plan review if required (Section 802). When a zoning certificate is sought for a development that is a part of a plat or subdivision, which has received final plat approval or which has been issued a conditional use permit, the plat or conditional use permit, together with any covenants, conditions, or other restrictions related thereto, shall be submitted as a part of the application for the zoning certificate. Application for a conditional use permit, where required, shall be made and approval granted by the City Council prior to application for a zoning certificate. In the case of any development located within a subdivision, the subdivision shall have final plat approval and have been recorded before the Planning Director will accept an application for a zoning certificate. If the development for which a zoning certificate is sought is required by this Ordinance to undergo site plan review, the approved site plan shall be made a part of the application for a zoning certificate and shall suffice as the statement of proposed use required by this Section. A temporary use and an accessory use shall require a zoning certificate as a precondition to their lawful establishment. The Planning Director may establish regulations governing the application requirements for a zoning certificate in the case of either a temporary or accessory use that is established at any time other than simultaneously with a principal use, in which case all information specified in this Section shall be submitted. The purpose of the required information is to provide the Planning Director with a sufficient factual basis to determine whether all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to temporary and accessory uses have been met. 804.02. Procedures. All developments for which a zoning certificate is required shall be reviewed for compliance with this Ordinance; within 30 calendar days after the application for a zoning certificate has been accepted, the Planning Director shall inform the applicant whether the application has been granted. A. In any case where the application is granted, the Planning Director shall issue a zoning certificate which shall state: “This certificate does not signify building codes review or approval nor subdivision review or approval and is not authorization to undertake any work without such review and approval where either is required. Before any structure to which this certificate is applicable may be occupied or used for any purpose, a certificate of occupancy must be obtained.”  B. In any case where an application is denied, the Planning Director shall state the specific reasons and shall cite the specific chapters, articles, and sections of this Ordinance upon which denial is based. If relief of such denial would be available by special permit or variance, the Planning Director shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the appropriate sections of this Ordinance. Following site plan and/or conditional use approval, an applicant shall have 18 months from the date of approval to begin construction. In addition, an applicant shall have 90 days from the date of issuance of a zoning certificate to begin construction. For the purposes of this Section, beginning of construction is defined as the date on which a building permit is issued by the City of Auburn for the construction, renovation, modification, or other work required. Section 805. Certificate of Occupancy. No land or building for which a zoning certificate has been issued shall be occupied or used in whole or in part for any use whatsoever after the effective date of this Ordinance until the owner, tenants, contract VIII-11 purchaser, or authorized agent thereof has been issued a certificate of occupancy by the Senior Building Inspector, indicating that the building or use complies with all zoning requirements of this Ordinance, the building code, and other applicable codes and regulations. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the premises in question have been inspected and found by the Senior Building Inspector to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance. No permit for any new use or construction that will involve the on-site disposal of sewage or waste, and no permit for a change in use or an alteration that will result in an increased volume of sewage or waste to be disposed of on the site, or which requires the County Health Department’s approval shall be issued until said approval has been issued by said Health Department. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy in no way relieves any recipient thereof from compliance with all of the terms of this Ordinance and all other applicable regulations. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless required bufferyards have been installed or appropriately bonded. Section 806. Access. As a precondition to approval of any site plan, subdivision plat, zoning certificate, building permit, or any other type of development permit, any development site shall have legal access to a publicly owned and maintained road. Physical access alone shall not qualify any development site for such permits. Legal access shall consist of the required length of road frontage, a flag lot approval pursuant to Section 512, or access easements under this Section. 806.01. Access Easements. Access by easement shall be approved only by specific action of the Planning Commission, and where normal requirements cannot be met. In all such cases, the following conditions shall apply:  A. The property owner seeking a permit shall possess a valid legal instrument, recorded in the Office of the Judge of Probate, indicating ownership of an access strip or easement at least 15 feet in width connecting the subject property with a public road;  B. No access shall serve more than one (1) building site; C. No development shall be authorized on any such building site other than one (1) single family dwelling and permitted accessory structures; D. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the access shall be graded and/or covered with a suitable surface so as to be passable to emergency vehicles; and E. The permit applicant shall sign a statement indicating that the City of Auburn has no obligation to repair and/or maintain the access in a usable condition, and that the City shall not be liable for injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from the site’s lack of direct access to a public road. Section 807. Fees.

IX-3  Section 905. Interpretations. 905.01. Purpose. The provisions of this section are intended to provide a simple and expeditious method for clarifying ambiguities in the text of this Ordinance, the zoning map which it incorporates, and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to it. It is also intended to provide a simple procedure for overcoming rigidities and limitations of finite use lists. 905.02. Authority. The Planning Director may, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations set forth in this Section, render interpretations of any provision of this Ordinance or any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it, including interpretations of the various uses in any district not expressly mentioned in this Ordinance. 905.03. Procedure. A. Written Request for Non-Use Interpretation. Except as provided below, a request for interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance, the zoning map, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be submitted in writing to the Planning Director. No fee shall be required in connection with any such request. Each such request shall set forth the specific provision or provisions to be interpreted, the facts of the specific situation giving rise to the request for an interpretation, and the precise interpretation claimed by the applicant to be correct. Before rendering any interpretation, the Planning Director shall receive such further facts and information as are in his judgment necessary to a meaningful interpretation of the provision in question. B. Application for Use Interpretation. Applications for a use interpretation shall be submitted to the Planning Director and shall, in all instances, contain at least the following information and documentation:  1. The applicant’s names, address, and interest in the subject property. 2. The owner’s name and address, if different from the applicant’s, and the owner’s signed consent to the filing of the application. 3. The names and addresses of all professional consultants advising the applicant with respect to the interpretation. 4. The street address and legal description of the subject property. 5. The zoning classification and present use of the subject property. 6. A complete description of the proposed use. 7. The uses permitted by the present zoning classification, which are most similar to the proposed use. 8. Documents, statements, and other evidence demonstrating that the proposed use will comply with all use limitations established for the district in which it is proposed to be located. 9. Such other and further information or documentation as the Planning Director may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of the particular application. C. Planning Director. Within 30 days following the receipt by the Planning Director of a completed request or application for interpretation, the Planning Director shall mail a written copy of the interpretation to the applicant. The Planning Director shall state the IX-4  specific precedent, reasons, and analysis on which such interpretation is based. The failure of the Planning Director to render an interpretation within such time, or such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed to be a rejection of the applicant’s proposed interpretation. The Planning Director shall keep a copy of each such interpretation on file and shall make a copy of each such file interpretation available for public inspection during normal business hours. D. Appeal. Appeals on interpretations rendered by the Planning Director pursuant to this Section may be taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment as provided in this Article. 905.04. Conditions on Use Interpretations. The following conditions shall govern the Planning Director, and the Board of Zoning Adjustment on appeals from the Planning Director, in issuing use interpretations:  A. No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use that was previously considered and rejected by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on an application for amendment. B. No use interpretation shall permit a use in any district in which such use is not listed either as permitted or conditional in Table 4-1. C. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be presented which demonstrates that it will comply with each use limitation established for the particular district. D. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in such district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses permitted or conditionally permitted in a less restrictive district. E. If the proposed use is more similar to a conditional use than a permitted use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a conditional use permit. F. Any use permitted pursuant to this Section shall fully comply with all requirements and standards imposed by this Ordinance. 905.05. Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Auburn, or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, zoning certificates, conditional use permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy. 905.06. Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified district shall supersede subsequent amendment to this Ordinance. Section 906. Amendments. This Ordinance may be amended from time to time as conditions warrant in the following manner. As used herein, the term “application” includes City Council resolution. A. Initiation Procedures. A proposed change to the zoning district boundaries or of the regulations may be initiated by the City Council, the Auburn Planning Commission, or by IX-5  petition of one or more owners or authorized agents of such owners of property within the area proposed to be changed. B. Text Amendments. The application for an amendment to the text of this Ordinance shall state in particular the article, section, subsection, and paragraph sought to be amended. The application shall contain the language of the proposed amendment and shall recite the reasons for such proposed change in the text. C. Map Amendments. 1. Applications to rezone any property, or any application which seeks to change or modify the standards and requirements imposed on a particular piece of property by the text and maps of this Ordinance, including applications for variances and conditional use permits, may be instituted by the City of Auburn or all the owners of the property sought to be affected, or their assigns. 2. In the case where the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, said applicant shall secure a notarized authorization to act as applicant from the property owner, along with the regularly required copy of the deed for the property. 3. When a development proposal involves approval of a site plan or subdivision plat in addition to a zoning map amendment, no site plan or subdivision plat approval shall be granted prior to approval of the map amendment. If a development plan and the corresponding request for zoning change are to be addressed at the same public hearing, the Planning Commission shall render a decision on the zoning application before considering any related site plan or subdivision plat. Such decision shall be based on the requirements of this Ordinance and the full range of uses permitted in the requested district, and not on the specific development concept proposed by the applicant. 4. All properties annexed into the City of Auburn shall receive the Rural (R) District designation. If another zoning designation is desired, the owner or authorized representative shall make application for rezoning in accordance with these regulations. D. Public Hearing. Upon application, the Planning Commission shall, after giving 15 days notice, conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment. The Planning Commission shall consider and make recommendations on all proposed amendments, taking into account: (1) the testimony at the hearing; (2) a site inspection of the property in question; (3) the recommendations from interested official bodies; and (4) the standards provided below. 906.01. Standards for Map Amendments. A. No rezoning of land from the Rural (R) District to the Comprehensive Development District (CDD) or Development District Housing (DDH), or from CDD or DDH to R shall be permitted except upon a specific and documented finding that:  1. A change in demand which significantly (by a factor of at least 25 percent) alters the development potential of the land has occurred such as: (a) a significant change in migration patterns, family size, or birth rate since the last amendment of the CDD or DDH or (b) a major change, such as the construction of a major road, the installation of a sewer line, or the provision of a formerly unavailable water supply, which significantly alters the suitability of an area for development. IX-6  2. An area designated as a CDD or DDH has been precluded from development by unanticipated, long term events such as the non-provision of a sewer plant or interceptor or a sewer ban, and that said area constitutes a significant part of the total amount of the planned CDD or DDH. B. No rezoning of land to the Urban Core (UC) District shall be permitted except upon a specific and documented finding that:  1. Marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities of an Urban Core District that cannot be provided by the district planned and mapped as urban core on the official zoning map and,  2. Impact studies of the existing Urban Core District and development in other districts, within a one (1) mile radius of the site proposed for rezoning, demonstrate that the proposed rezoning will not have adverse impacts on their economic viability and,  3. Traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed urban core development will not have adverse impacts on the level of service of arterial roads, whether in incorporated or unincorporated areas, within a two (2) mile radius of the site proposed for rezoning. C. No rezoning of land to the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts shall be permitted except on a specific and documented finding that:  1. Marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities and uses of the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts that cannot be provided by the districts planned and mapped as Urban Neighborhood on the official zoning map, and;  2. Improvements to streets and pedestrian ways, either existing or planned, can be undertaken in a manner that does not adversely impact the existing planned system of access and separation of vehicular and foot traffic, and;  3. Traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed Urban Neighborhood development will not adversely impact the level of service of arterial roads, whether in incorporated or unincorporated areas, within a two (2) mile radius of the site of the proposed rezoning. D. No rezoning of land to the Industrial (I) District shall be permitted except on a specific and documented finding that:  1. There is an inadequate supply of land zoned for these uses or the proposed use cannot be accommodated by those sites due to lack of transportation, water, or sewer, or that the market area to be served by the proposed use cannot be efficiently served by the geographical location of the existing Industrial District. 2. Roads, floodplains, or other existing or planned features will insure sufficient buffering to protect surrounding land and uses from the negative impacts of the proposed industrial use. E. If all owners in an existing subdivision or proposed subdivision located in any R, CDD, DDH or RDD district petition the City Council for a Neighborhood Conservation District designation, it may be granted. IX-7  F. There shall be no rezoning of land from Rural to any other district until such time as adequate public utilities are available. 906.02. Recommendation of the Planning Commission. A. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council. Within 60 days of the Planning Commission rendering its recommendation to the City Council, the City Council shall take action on the application, otherwise the application shall fail. The City Council may elect to grant an extension for good cause. No amendment shall be passed except by a majority vote of the members of the City Council present. B. The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public interest and not solely for the interest of the applicant. C. For each disapproved map amendment, the Planning Commission shall make findings on each of the following matters based on the evidence presented to it:  1. The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the proposed zoning. 2. The adequacy of public facilities, such as sewer and water, and other required public services. Section 907. Variances. 907.01. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to empower the Board of Zoning Adjustment to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this Ordinance. It is expected that the granting of variances will be rare; however, a variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of any regulation enacted under this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such property. Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. This shall include existing development sites, proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance. The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved. 907.02. Application. Any property owner may apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance using forms to be obtained from the Planning Department at least 15 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. 907.03. Standards for Variances. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict application of the provision of this Ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards are satisfied. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall be sparingly exercised. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property as intended by the Zoning Ordinance. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In particular, the applicant shall establish and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and standards listed below: IX-8   A. The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. B. The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use, which is not permitted in the district. C. There must be proof of unique circumstances: there must exist special circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the district, and which circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building. D. There must be proof of unnecessary hardship. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted. Furthermore, the hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions; it must result from the application of this Ordinance; it must be suffered directly by the property in question; and evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered. E. That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose. F. That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent neighborhood. G. That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies. 907.04. Standards for Variances Applicable to the Airport. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations of this Section may apply to the Auburn Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Applications for variances shall follow the same procedure for other variances. The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. A. Criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the board of adjustment may grant an airport obstruction variance for a proposed development. Such a variance may be granted if the board determines that:  1. The literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest (i.e. the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace without adverse impact to surrounding environs)  IX-9  2. Granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation. 3. Granting the variance will do substantial justice. 4. The variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations. All variances shall be subject to conditions and terms as recommended by the FAA. B. The following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be approved:  1. A condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an obstruction in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number 70/7460-1K, as it may be amended. Where such marking or lighting is required, such requirement shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) for the affected structure. 2. The FAA must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid. 3. Consideration shall be given to:  a. The nature of the terrain and height (height per § 512.02) of existing structures. b. Public and private interests and investments. c. The character of flying operations and planned development of airports. d. FAA designated federal airways. e. Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport. f. Technological advances. g. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air. h. Land use density. i. The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. j. The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or proposed structures identified in the City of Auburn. k. FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the FAA. l. Comments and recommendations from the Airport. m. Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense, to install, operate and maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. IX-10  907.05 Public Hearing. Upon application, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed variance to be held ten (10) days after a public notice has been published in the local newspaper, after signs announcing the public hearing have been erected on the property in question, and after the adjacent property owners most affected by the variance request have been notified by certified mail. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider and decide all proposed variances taking into account the standards enumerated above. After the close of a public hearing and within ten (10) days the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall render a written decision, setting forth the reasons for such decision, which shall be accompanied by finding of fact(s) specifying the reason(s) for such decision. All such decisions are final and binding on all parties. Section 908. Appeals. Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected by any provision of this Ordinance or by any decision, or any order to stop, cease, and desist, issued by the Planning Director in enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance. 908.01. General Rules and Procedures for Appeals. A. Any appeals from the ruling of the Planning Director concerning the enforcement and interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance shall be filed with the Planning Director within 15 days after the date of the Planning Director’s decision thereon. B. All appeals and applications made to the Board shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Board and accompanied by fees prescribed by resolution of the City Council. C. All appeals and applications shall refer to the specific provisions of this Ordinance involved. D. The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a written decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay. The Board may affirm, reserve, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, as in its opinion it determines ought to be done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The Planning Department shall maintain complete records of all appeal actions of the Board. E. Within ten (10) days after the close of a public hearing the Board shall render a written decision giving the reason(s) for its decision. F. In rendering a decision with respect to an appeal from any order, decision, or determination the Board shall strictly interpret the language of the Ordinance and shall find that the Planning Director was correct in his decision or in error. However, the Board shall not render any decision which shall modify an order, decision, or determination which confers rights or privileges on the appellant that are not otherwise permissible under the strict interpretation of this language of this Ordinance. G. Such decision shall be submitted to the appellant and the Planning Director. 908.02. All decisions rendered by the Board shall be final and binding on all parties. No request for a variance or appeal of an administrative decision shall be reheard, and no further application shall be accepted, once a decision has been given, except under one or more of the following conditions:  A. New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was not available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing. IX-11  B. The decision resulted from an error in procedures required by the Ordinance or State law made by the Board, the Planning Director, or any other City official. C. The decision resulted from an error in substantive law under the provisions of this Ordinance or the Code of Alabama. Where no error is alleged and no new evidence is available a new or more effective presentation by the applicant shall not constitute grounds for rehearing a decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Any applicant wishing a rehearing shall appear before the Board to present one or more of the qualifying conditions listed in this Section. If the Board finds that one or more of these conditions exists, the applicant shall be permitted to submit a new application, together with the required fees. The new application shall be heard at a subsequent meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements. Allowing a new application does not obligate the Board to grant the request. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board may within 15 days after such decision appeal to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction. Section 909. Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense.

M-l Light Industrial District M-2 General Industrial District (5) Special purpose districts. PUD Planned Unit Development District MR Municipal Reserve District F Flood Hazard District SLD Sanitary Landfill District Sec. 21. Zoning map. (a) The zoning districts established by this ordinance are bounded and defined by an official zoning map which shall be known as the Hueytown Zoning Map and which, together with all explanatory materials contained therein, is hereby made a part of this ordinance. (b) The official zoning map shall be drawn on durable transparent material from which prints can be made and shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator. (c) The Zoning Administrator shall update the official zoning map within thirty days after amendments to it are adopted by the City Council. 8  (d) Should the official zoning map or any portion be lost, destroyed, damaged, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of revisions, the Zoning Administrator shall have a new map drawn and adopted by resolution of the City Council. Any map amendment shall follow rezoning amendment procedures contained in this ordinance. Sec. 22. Zoning district boundaries. The rules of this section shall be used to determine the precise locations of any district boundary shown on the Hueytown Zoning Map. (1) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following any jurisdictional limits shall be construed as following such limits. (2) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets, alleys, or rights-of-way shall be construed as following such streets, alleys, or rights-of-way (3) Boundary lines, which follow or approximately follow platted lot lines or other property lines as shown on the Jefferson County Tax Maps shall be construed as following such lines. (4) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines. (5) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following shorelines of any lakes or ponds shall be construed to follow the mean high waterlines of such lakes or ponds. In the event of a change in the mean high waterline, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the actual mean high waterline. (6) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following the channel of such water courses taken at mean low water. In the event of a natural change in the location of such streams, rivers, or other water courses, the district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.

Unless otherwise provided, no building, structure, or land shall be used except in the zoning districts indicated by this article and according to the additional regulations of this ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances. Sec. 24. Use limitations due to zoning standards. Although a use may be permitted according to specified procedures in a particular district, such use may not necessarily be permitted on every parcel of land in the district. A use may be permitted only if it can meet all of the standards of this ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances. Sec. 25. Combined principal and accessory uses. (a) Unless otherwise prevented by this ordinance, more than one permitted principal use may be combined on a lot if all of the combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally related to one another. Further, all zoning regulations for each of the combined uses shall be met. (b) Whenever an activity, which may or may not be separately listed in the district is conducted in conjunction with a permitted use in the district as an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity on a lot, the  9  incidental activity shall be permitted as an accessory use if the combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally related to one another. (c) For the purpose of this section commonly associated means that the association of such combined uses takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common community acceptance of their relatedness. Sec. 26. Interpretation of uses. This ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings given the infinite variations of essentially similar uses. Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to make interpretations so as to classify any questioned use within a listed use of most similar impact and characteristics. However, in no case shall the Zoning Administrator interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in question is more similar in impact and characteristics to another listed use. Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's use interpretation may be filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Sec. 27. Unclassified uses. In the event the Zoning Administrator finds a new or unusual use that cannot appropriately fit a listed use in any district, the following procedures shall be followed: (1) If compatible with the existing zoning district intent, the unclassified use shall be permitted by special exception upon approval and subject to the conditions set by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.

Special Purpose Districts Sec. 80. PUD Planned Unit Development District. (a) PUD District intent. This District permits a tract to be planned and developed as an integral unit under single ownership or control, consisting of a combination of residential and non-residential uses. The District intent is to provide a living, working, and shopping environment within the development that contributes to a sense of community and a coherent living style. Further, the District seeks to provide a development framework that obtains commercial and industrial business activity that significantly improves the economic development of the community; to encourages the preservation and enhancement of the natural amenities of land and protect natural features; and to reduce improvement costs through more efficient arrangement of varied land uses, buildings, circulation systems, and infrastructure. (b) PUD approval process. Approval of a PUD requires a three step approval process, as follows: (1) Rezoning and concept plan approval. A concept plan shall accompany each application for rezoning to the PUD District. Development of the PUD shall be in substantial accord with the approved concept plan. The concept plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a professional engineer, land surveyor, architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Alabama. The concept plan shall show, in schematic detail, the concept for use and development of the entire PUD tract. (2) Preliminary site plan approval. Following rezoning and concept plan approval, the developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Planning Commission for each phase of the development in substantial accord with the concept plan. The preliminary site plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a professional engineer, land surveyor, architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Alabama. The preliminary plan shall show information necessary for the Planning Commission to adequately assess the suitability of the proposed development, including at a minimum the following items: the location of proposed uses; proposed building areas and heights; proposed residential development density; housing types; lots with proposed sizes, widths, and yards; proposed screening and buffer yards, proposed off-street parking and loading areas; layout of streets; pedestrian facilities, and drives; location of all entrances to the tract; and layout and configuration of common open space. Also, a narrative text and supplemental drawings shall accompany the preliminary site plan, describing the general design and construction policies for the PUD, the proposed design and construction standards for streets; the treatment of environmentally-sensitive land located in the project tract (areas of flooding, severe slope, woodlands, streams, lakes, and ponds); the proposed time frame for phased development; and such other conditions for use and development proposed by the applicant. All preliminary site plans shall be in substantial accord with the approved concept plan. Any deviation in the preliminary site plan from the approved concept plan shall require re-submittal of the PUD rezoning and concept plan approval application. (3) Final site plan approval. Before each phase of the development is constructed, a final site plan shall be required, in accordance with § 314. Site plan review. Final site plan approval shall be coordinated with the approval of subdivision plats and construction plans required by the Hueytown Subdivision Regulations. All final site plans shall be in substantial accord with the approved preliminary site plan. Any deviation in the final site plan from the approved preliminary site plan shall require re-submittal of the preliminary site plan application. (c) PUD District use regulations. A Planned Unit Development District may be established for any tract. The Planned Unit Development (referred to as PUD) shall consist of a combination of uses planned and developed as an integral unit under single ownership or control. Specific use limitations shall be established in the process of plan approval. (d) PUD District dimensional regulations. In any PUD, the developer may create lots and construct buildings without regard to the conventional minimum lot size, lot width, or yard restrictions of this ordinance except that:  43  (1) A 50 feet lot boundary setback shall apply where and to the extent that the development abuts land that is not part of the PUD, and (2) Each lot must be of sufficient size and dimensions that it can support the structure proposed to be located on it, consistent with all other applicable requirements of this ordinance, as approved by the Planning Commission in the preliminary and final site plans. (e) PUD District design and construction standards. Where the design and construction standards approved in the preliminary and final site plans conflict with the subdivision regulations and any other requirements of this zoning ordinance, the standards approved in the PUD approval process shall control. (f) Issuance of permits within a PUD subdivision. Permits may be issued in any phase of a PUD subdivision with public improvements under construction following completion of final site plan and subdivision plat approval, provided: (1) No building permits for a subdivision with public improvements under construction shall be issued by the Building Inspector unless the extent of street improvements is adequate for vehicular access by the prospective builder and by police and fire equipment. Further, no building permit shall be issued for the greater of two or the final 10% of lots within the subdivision until all public improvements and dedications have been completed by the developer and accepted by the City. (2) No certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued by the Building Inspector prior to the completion and dedication of required public improvements and posting of a maintenance bond for public improvements. 44  Sec. 81. MR Municipal Reserve District. (a) MR District intent. This district serves as an interim zone for newly annexed areas of the municipality. The MR District seeks to protect newly annexed areas prior to the time comprehensive zoning can be enacted. (b) MR District regulations. (1) On the effective date of annexation all newly-annexed property shall be zoned MR Municipal Reserve District. (2) At its next meeting following the Council's adoption of the annexation, the Planning Commission shall initiate a petition to rezone property from the MR District to any other district contained within this ordinance. In determining the most appropriate zone, the Planning Commission shall duly consider the following items, among others: a. Comprehensive land use studies/plan; b. The desires of the property owners subject to rezoning; c. The State-mandated purposes and considerations of zoning, as set forth in section 11-52-72, Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended. (3) All uses in existence at the time of annexation may lawfully continue under the provisions of the MR District, in accord with the E-l District standards.

The provisions of this district shall be overlay provisions to the existing underlying zoning districts. All properties within the district shall be designated by the F suffix added to the underlying district prefix, i.e., R-1F. As overlay provisions, the requirements of this district shall serve as a supplement to the underlying zoning district provisions. Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions of this overlay district and the provisions of the underlying district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. (c) Compliance with Flood Hazard District regulations. (1) No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, enlarged, converted, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms of this district and other applicable regulations. (2) The provisions of this district are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these provisions and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (3) The provisions of this district supersede any regulations currently in effect in flood-prone areas. However, any underlying regulations shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. (d) Flood hazard terms defined. The following flood hazard terms when used in this district shall have the meanings defined by this subsection: base flood or 100 year flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to buildings or other structures, the placement of manufactured homes, streets and other paving, utilities, filling, grading, excavation, mining, dredging, or drilling operations. flood or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas during the 100 year base flood. floodplain. A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream, or watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation during the 100 year base flood; an area subject to the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source during the base flood. floodway. The designated area of the floodplain required to carry and discharge flood waters of a given magnitude during the base flood. floodway fringe. That area of the floodplain not included in the floodway. lowest floor. Includes the lowest enclosed area of a structure (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this district. mean sea level. The National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. 46  manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. start of construction (includes substantial improvement). The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. structure. Anything constructed or erected with a fixed location on the ground or attached to something having a fixed location on the ground. substantial improvement. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during the life of a structure, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or no that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions. (e) Flood Hazard District boundaries. (1) All properties included within the 100-year floodplain boundary on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, effective date September 29, 1989, or as later amended, and areas along all small streams specified by this division shall be included within the F Flood Hazard District boundaries. All designated properties within the Flood Hazard District shall be referred to by a suffix to the underlying zoning district designation (i.e., R-l-F, B-2- F, etc.) (2) All Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated effective September 29, 1989, and any subsequent revisions, and the Flood Insurance Study, dated September 29, 1989, with supporting data and maps, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be supplemental to the provisions of this district. (3) The delineation of any of the floodplain areas within the Flood Hazard District may be revised by the City Council where natural or man-made changes have occurred or detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual document or study indicate the need for revision. Such studies may include, but not be limited to U.S. Soil Conservation Service soil reports, U.S. Geological Survey topographic surveys, or reports of the City Engineer or other qualified consultant. However, prior to any such revision, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Upon final approval of the revised delineation of the regulated floodplain, the City shall give notice of the revisions to the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. 47  (4) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the Flood Hazard District or any floodplain areas within the district (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of the district, an administrative appeal may be filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment. (f) Floodplain areas. The Flood Hazard District includes various areas subject to flooding. The primary basis for the delineation of these areas shall be the Flood Insurance Study for Hueytown, Alabama prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated September 29, 1989, and subsequent amendments. The delineations of the floodplain for the purposes of this district shall be as follows: (1) Floodway. The floodway is delineated using the criteria that a certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the 100 year flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood at any point. These floodways are more specifically defined in the above-referenced Flood Insurance Study and are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps accompanying that study. (2) Floodway fringe. The floodway fringe shall be that area of the 100 year floodplain not included in the floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary of the floodway fringe shall be the 100 year flood elevations contained in the flood profiles of the above-referenced Flood Insurance Study, and the boundaries are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps accompanying that study. (3) Approximated floodplain. The approximated floodplain shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a 100 year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Where the specific 100 year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for a permit shall have a technical study completed to determine such data. (4) Small streams. Small streams exist where no base flood data and no flood boundaries have been provided by the Flood Insurance Study. Floodplain areas along small streams are within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of bank or twenty feet on each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer determines otherwise. (g) Required permits and certifications. (1) Building permit. Application for a building permit shall be submitted prior to any development activities within the Flood Hazard District and shall include the following information which shall be maintained as public record by the Zoning Administrator: a. Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of new or substantially improved structures, prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer. b. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure will be flood-proofed, prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer. c. Where a structure is intended to be flood proofed below the base flood level, a certification from a professional engineer or architect that the structural design, specifications, and plans for construction will meet the flood-proofing criteria of this district and the additional provisions of the Current City of Hueytown Building Code. d. Description, prepared by a professional engineer, of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 48  (2) Certificate of occupancy. Before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, during the construction stage of the development, the permit holder shall provide the following certifications which shall be maintained as public record by the Zoning Administrator: a. The as-built elevation of the lowest floor, flood proofed elevation, or the elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, certified by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer. b. Evidence of flood-proofing of a building, where required, certified by a professional engineer or architect. (3) Where additional federal or state permit requirements apply, the Zoning Administrator shall require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the building permit as public record. (4) The Zoning Administrator shall notify adjacent communities and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (5) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided by the Flood Insurance Study in approximated floodplains or along small streams, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. If no data is available, then the applicant for a permit, shall submit data in accordance with recognized hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. The technical analyses and determination of data shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications who Shall certify that the technical methods correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts and consider existing land use and reasonable estimates of ultimate development according to the City's comprehensive land use plan. All technical studies shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer. (h) General flood hazard prevention standards. The following standards shall apply to all floodplain areas: (1) Under no circumstances shall any use, activity, or development adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.

(8) Flammable, explosive, toxic, or otherwise hazardous materials shall not be stored in the floodplain. 49  (9) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to an existing structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this district, shall meet the requirements of new construction. (10) New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwater shall be provided. (11) Any manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot or more above the base flood elevation. It shall be securely anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with the Current City of Hueytown Building Code. Such standards shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to existing manufactured home parks, subdivisions, and lots where an existing manufactured home is replaced or substantially improved; to any expansion to an existing park or subdivision; and to new parks, subdivisions and installations after the effective date of this ordinance. (12) New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, institutional or other non- residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. (13) Structures may be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated one foot or more above the base flood provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. The walls shall use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. (14) For all new construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floors that are subject to flooding, the following standards shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect: a. The enclosed area shall be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters to equalize hydrostatic flood forces. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, values or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. b. Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation. c. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairways or elevator). d. The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. (i) Standards for small streams. (1) No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of bank or twenty feet on each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. (2) New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations  50  established in accordance with this district. (j) Standards for subdivision plats.

Other similar uses and activities provided they cause no increase in flood heights and velocities and are undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and elevation provisions of this district. (4) Special exception use criteria. In passing upon an application for a special exception use, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall consider the review criteria for special exceptions contained in § 317 and in addition, all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this district, and the following criteria: a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. e. The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed uses. g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. h. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area. i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges. (5) Conditions attached to special exceptions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of special exception use permits as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this district. (l) Variances. (1) An application for a variance to the standards of this district may be submitted to the Zoning Board of Adjustment in accordance with the administrative provisions of this zoning ordinance. The Board shall refer the variance application to a professional engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposal in relation to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the plans for protection and other related matters. (2) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base  52  flood discharge would result. (3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. (4) The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not approve a variance unless it finds the criteria variances contained within § 318 and in addition, the following criteria have been satisfactorily determined: a. A showing of good and sufficient cause; b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased 52 flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, creation of nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances. (5) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the Zoning Administrator that the issuance of the variance to construct a structure below the 100 year flood elevation increases the risks to life and property and will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. (6) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation. (7) The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all variance and administrative appeal actions and shall annually report such actions to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (m) Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this district is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. Consequently, this district does not imply that land outside the floodplain or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. Therefore, this district shall not create liability on the part of the City of Hueytown or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on the provisions of this district or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 53  Sec. 83.

Sees. 181-189. Reserved. 82  Division 3. Screening and Buffer Yard Regulations Sec. 190. Purpose of screening and buffer yard regulations. The intent of this division is to set minimum standards that reduce common conflicts associated with incompatible adjacent land uses and to protect natural boundaries. These standards seek to promote visual harmony, reduce noise, divert emissions, restrict passage, and enhance the natural environment, thereby providing for a compatible mix of otherwise conflicting uses of adjacent properties. Sec. 191. Screening and buffer yard terms defined. (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2) The following screening and buffer yard terms when used in this ordinance shall have the meanings defined by this section. Buffer yard. A landscaped strip of specified width along certain segments of the site perimeter reserved for screening one use or structure from another adjacent use. Screening. A method of visually shielding or obscuring one use or structure from another adjacent use by opaque fencing, walls, berms, or densely-planted vegetation installed within a buffer yard. Cross references - See § 371 for interpretation of definitions, § 372 for word usage, § 373 for general terms defined, and § 374 for uses defined. Sec. 192. Administration. (a) These standards are intended to encourage, not hamper, innovation in landscape and architectural design and shall be administered flexibly so as to give reasonable consideration to this objective, (b) Screening and buffer yard standards imposed by § 346 Conditional re-zoning shall take precedence over the provisions-of this division. (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). Sec. 193. Screening specifications. (a) Acceptable screening materials include any combination of solid fencing (weather-resistant wood, brick, or decorative masonry), evergreen shrubs, or earth berms of a specified height. Planting of evergreen trees may also be required. Screening shall be continuously maintained, present an attractive exterior appearance, and in the case of fencing, be of durable construction. (b) Location of screening shall not obstruct the visibility of traffic circulation.(Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). (c) Evergreen plantings, where installed, shall be planted within the beginning of the first opportune planting season following approval of development but may be coordinated with construction scheduling. Evergreen shrubs shall be a rapid growth variety, with a minimum height of three feet at planting, be planted two feet on center or less, and be capable of attaining an opaque density to the prescribed ultimate height within two years of planting. Evergreen trees shall be a rapid growth variety and be a minimum height of five feet at planting and be planted eight feet on center or less.(Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). (d) Fencing, where installed, shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. (e) All plantings shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition and, when necessary, replaced with new growth. All fencing shall be permanently maintained in good condition and, whenever necessary, repaired or replaced. Sec. 194. Buffer yard specifications. (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). 83  (a) The buffer yard shall be reserved solely for screening. No building, structure (except for privacy fencing) nor paving shall be permitted. The entire buffer yard shall be planted with trees and shrubs. (b) The amount of buffer yard shall not be more than 10 percent of the total site area, but in such case that the buffer yard is reduced, the intensity of screening shall be proportionately increased. In no such event however, shall a buffer yard on a site be reduced to less than seven feet in width. Sec. 195. Determination of adjacent land use classes. The required screening and buffer yard shall depend on the land use intensity of the site in comparison to adjacent sites, including those directly across any right-of-way. The classes of land uses are shown on the following table which determines the class according to the principal use of the site. Table X. Land Use Classes class principal land use    A  Single family residences, including farm residences, vacant lots zoned AG, R-l, R-2, R-3, or reserved for single family residences in a residential cluster subdivision or planned unit development. B  Patio homes, townhouses, duplexes, and vacant lots reserved for such uses in a residential cluster subdivision or planned unit development. C  Multiplexes, manufactured home parks, manufactured home subdivisions, apartments, and vacant lots zoned R-4, R-5,or R-MH or reserved for such uses in a residential cluster subdivision or planned unit development. D  All institutional uses permitted in the residential districts, all additional uses permitted in the B-1 District, and vacant lots zoned B-l or reserved for B-l uses in a planned unit development. E All additional commercial and non-residential uses permitted in the B-2 and B-3 Districts that are not permitted in the B-l District and vacant lots zoned B-2 or B-3 or reserved for such uses in a planned unit development.

Modification or waiver of screening and buffer yard. These screening and buffer yard standards may be modified or waived by the Zoning Board of Adjustment in certain cases where a site is subject to any of the following circumstances: (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). (1) Natural land characteristics would achieve the same intent of this division. (2) Innovative landscape or architectural design is employed to achieve an equivalent screening and buffer yard effect. (3) Impending development of adjacent property would make these standards unreasonable or impractical. (4) The adjacent property is physically separated by an arterial street right-of-way.

Such signs are also subject to the following:  (a) No illuminated sign, other than a residential project entrance sign, shall be permitted within 100 feet of any residential district, unless the Administrator determines that the impact of such lighting beyond the boundaries of the lot where the illuminated sign is located is clearly inconsequential. (b) Internally illuminated signs shall be prohibited in the R districts, the B-1, or the AG district, except for church signs, vending machines, telephone booths automated tellers, vacancy information, open or closed messages, public service information (time, date, weather, etc.) displays that do not convey an advertising message where permitted in the district. 92  (c) Except exempt signs and signs displaying public service information (time, date, weather, etc. ), illuminated tubing or strings of lights that outline property lines, sales area, roof lines, doors, windows, or similar areas; and signs illuminated by flashing or intermittent light or lights of changing degrees of intensity are prohibited.

Electronic Changeable Copy Signs, where permitted, shall be subject to the following standards. 1. Sign display technology shall be programmed so that the message or image on the sign changes no more often than every five (5) seconds. 2. There shall be no effects of movement, flashing, scintillation, or similar effects in the individual images. 3. Changes of image shall be substantially instantaneous as seen by the human eye and shall not use fading, rolling, window shading, dissolving or similar effects as part of the change. 4. Automatic level controls shall be used to reduce light levels at night and under cloudy or other darkened conditions, in accordance with the following standards. All electronic or digital display units shall have installed ambient light monitors, and shall at all times allow such monitors to automatically adjust the brightness level of the message based on ambient light conditions. Maximum brightness levels shall not exceed 5,000 nits when measured from the sign’s face at its maximum brightness, during daylight hours and 500 nits when measured from the sign face at its maximum brightness between dusk and dawn, i.e., the time of day between sunrise and sunset. 5. Any sign using video technology which malfunctions, fails, or ceases to operate in its usual or normal programmed manner causing therein motion, movement, flashing or any other similar effects, shall be repaired or disconnected within twenty-four (24) hours by the owner or operator of such sign. 6. The message area shall not exceed the permitted copy area for the applicable sign type in the district, or 200 sf, whichever is less. 7. The following limitations shall apply to the location of signs using video technology: a. A sign on which the video technology includes 100 sf or more of sign area shall not be erected within 500 ft of a residential district. b.

No permanent or temporary sign exceeding four square feet in area shall be permitted within 25 feet of an intersection street right-of-way line (50 feet if the intersecting street is an arterial highway), within fifteen feet from the front lot line, or within 10 feet from a private drive. This limitation may be waived if such sign does not obstruct visibility between a height of 30 inches and eight feet above the nearest street grade level or otherwise does not interfere with traffic visibility for entrance onto or exit from the lot and adjacent lots and the visibility of traffic flow  93  through nearby intersections, as determined by the Administrator. In any event, no sign, regardless of size, height, or design shall extend into any right-of-way, except as expressly authorized. SECTION FOURTEEN. CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS. (a) All signs shall conform with city building codes, which provide a comprehensive set of construction standards for signs.

(b) Illumination may not be added to a nonconforming sign. (c) A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with these sign regulations. (d) The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as the change does not create any new nonconformity, such as creating an off-premises sign where such a sign would not be permitted. (e) Unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance, any sign that does not conform with the provisions of these sign regulations shall be amortized to conform with this Ordinance, as follows: 1. Portable signs shall, within 90 days after the effective date of this Ordinance, be altered to comply with these sign regulations or be removed. 2. All other nonconforming signs shall, within one year after the effective date of this Ordinance, be altered to comply with these sign regulations or be removed. (f) As soon as possible after the effective date of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall make reasonable effort to notify the person responsible for each such sign and inform such person of the nonconformity, required corrections to bring such sign into conformity, by what date the corrections need to be completed, and the consequences of failure to make the necessary corrections. SECTION SIXTEEN. PENALTY. Any person, firm or corporation within the corporate limits of the city committing a violation of this Ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than One Dollar ($1.00) nor more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), and/or may be imprisoned or sentenced to labor for the city for a period not exceeding six (6) months, at the discretion of the court trying the case.

Cross references - See § 362 for meetings of the Board, § 363 for appeals to the Board, and § 364 for powers and duties of the Board. Sec. 319. Variance procedures. (a) Justification for variance. Variances to the terms of this ordinance may be granted individual cases upon a finding by the Board of Adjustment that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provision of this ordinance subject to a variance will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. More specifically, the Board shall determine all of the following criteria have been satisfied: (1) The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship, even to the extent of authorizing nonconforming uses. Where the Board authorizes a nonconforming use in a district to prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors, when taken together, must indicate that the plight of the premises in question is unique in that they cannot be put reasonably to a conforming use because of the limitations imposed upon them by reason of their classification in a specific zone. (2) Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. (3) Hardship alone is not sufficient; Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship. (4) Mere financial loss of a kind which might be common to all of the property owners in a district in not an unnecessary hardship. (5) Variances should be granted sparingly, and spirit of this ordinance in harmony with the spirit of State law should be carefully preserved, to the end that the structure of this ordinance would not disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands of the Board. (6) When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for claim that a variance should be granted. (b) Application for variance. An application for a variance shall be filed with the Secretary at least 30 days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board of Adjustment. The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made available by the Secretary and shall include the following information and materials: (1) Name, signature, and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, if any. (2) Address of the property under consideration. (3) Zoning and land use of the property under consideration. (4) Nature of the variance with reference to applicable zoning provisions. (5) Justification for the variance in accordance with all of the criteria in (a) above. (6) A vicinity map showing the location of the property. (7) A plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property boundaries and proposed development layout with the variance noted or highlighted. 103  (8) Stamped no. 10 envelopes (legal size) with the names and addresses of adjacent property owners (including those directly across a public right-of-way), as shown in the most recent records of the Jefferson County Tax Assessor. (9) A $100 filing fee. (c) At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Board of Adjustment hearing, the Secretary shall give written notice of the variance to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as submitted with the application. The notice shall state the following information: (1) The name of the applicant. (2) The location of the property. (3) The nature of the variance and the applicable zoning provisions. (4) The time, date, and location of the Board hearing. State law reference - Board of Adjustment, Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-80.

Secs. 320-329. Reserved. 104  Division 3. Non-conformities Sec. 330. Purpose of provisions for non-conformities. Within the districts established by this ordinance or by subsequent amendments to this ordinance, lawful uses, lots, buildings, and characteristics of uses existed in conformity to all applicable zoning provisions before this ordinance was adopted or subsequently amended. However, as a result of adoption or subsequent amendment to this ordinance, such lawful activities no longer conform to all applicable zoning provisions. These activities shall be deemed lawful non-conformities, which are permitted to remain under the provisions of this division. It is the intent of this division that the continuation of lawful non-conformities should not be indefinite and that all non-conformities with this ordinance should gradually be removed. Sec. 331. Types of non-conformities. (a) non-conforming building. An otherwise legal building that does not conform with the yard, height, or other dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located or is designed or intended for a nonconforming use. (b) non-conforming characteristics of use. An otherwise legal characteristic of use, lot, or structure which does not conform with the off-street parking and loading standards, screening and buffer yard standards, sign standards, or any supplemental standards for the district in which it is located or is designed or intended for a nonconforming use. (c) non-conforming lot. An otherwise legally platted lot that does not conform with the dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located. (d) nonconforming use. The otherwise legal use of a building, structure, or lot that does not conform with the permitted uses for the district in which it is located. Sec. 332. Continuation of non-conformities. Non-conformities may be continued as provided by this section: (1) If any changes in ownership or tenancy occur, any nonconformity may be continued by the new owner or tenant under the provisions of this division. (2) A nonconformity may continue if it does not cease for any reason for a period exceeding six months. (3) Plans for nonconforming construction, site development, site alteration, use or occupancy for which a valid building permit, certificate of occupancy, site plan, special exception, preliminary subdivision plat, or other City license was approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment may proceed. However, all construction, site development, or site alteration must be completed within one year and use or occupancy must be established within 30 days after the effective completion date. (4) A lot that was legally platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance that does not meet the lot area, width, or dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located may be developed or used in conformity with all other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. (5) Any use in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment that results in a non-conforming characteristic of use may continue in nonconformity with the off-street parking and loading, screening and buffer yard, sign, or supplemental standards so long as the kind or extent of such use does not increase the ordinance requirements for such characteristics of use. 105  (6) A non-conforming use may occupy any part of a structure or lot that was arranged or designed for such use unless occupancy of that part of the structure or lot has been discontinued for a period exceeding six months. Sec. 333. ""Repair and maintenance of non-conformities. - (a) On any structure, devoted entirely or partly to a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary maintenance or repair and replacement of walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided the cubic content of the structure, as it existed at the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment, shall not be increased. The cost of the work shall not exceed ten percent of the appraised replacement cost of the structure or the part. (b) On any lot devoted entirely or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary maintenance or repair and replacement of parking and loading areas, signs, lighting, fences, walls, and related exterior amenities provided the extent of those amenities shall not be increased or rearranged. (c) Nothing in this division shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or exterior amenity declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, on order of such official, nor shall anything in this division be deemed to exempt any such structure or amenity from any requirements of any federal, state, or local government regulation. Sec. 334. Alteration, enlargement, or restoration of non-conformities. (a) No non-conforming use shall be enlarged within a structure or occupy a greater area of land than at the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment. (b) No nonconforming use or structure shall be moved to any portion of the lot other than that occupied at the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment. (c) No nonconforming use, structure or characteristic of use may be altered or enlarged or intensified in any way, which increases its nonconformity but may be altered or reduced to decrease its nonconformity. (d) If a nonconforming structure is removed or damaged in any manner to the extent that the restoration costs exceeds fifty percent of the original value of the structure immediately before the damaging occurrence, subsequent use of the lot shall be in full compliance with the district in which it is located. Sec. 335. Change in use. (a) Any non-conforming use, which changes to a permitted use within the district in which it is located, shall not revert to a nonconforming use. (b) A nonconforming use may change to a new nonconforming use provided the new use is more in keeping with the district in which it is located and is less objectionable and measures less external impact than the existing non-conforming use. In determining whether the new use would be in greater conformity with this ordinance, impact criteria such as, but not limited to, the following shall be evaluated: (1) Traffic generation and congestion, including truck, passenger car, and pedestrian traffic. (2) Noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, odor, glare, or vibration. Sec. 336. Appraised cost or value.

g e  ARTICLE ONE TITLE, SHORT TITLE, OFFICIAL ZONING MAP Section 1.1 Title The Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as “The Zoning Ordinance for the City of Troy, Alabama.” Section 1.2 Short Title The Ordinance and all subsequent amendments, attachments, and supplements thereto shall be known as “Troy Zoning Ordinance.” Section 1.3 Official Zoning Map The City is hereby divided into zones, or districts, as shown on the Official Zoning Map which, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this Ordinance. 1.31 The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: “This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the City of Troy, Alabama,” together with the date of the adoption of this Ordinance. 1.32 If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council, with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: The new boundary line shall be drawn and within the newly zoned area a circle shall be drawn and include the designation of the new zone, the ordinance number which approved the change, and the effective date of the change. Such changes shall be completed by the City Planner or a designee thereof. 1.33 No Changes of any nature shall be made on the Official Zoning Map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Ordinance. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance and punishable as provided under Article Seven. 1.34 Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or published, the Official Zoning Map which shall be located in the Troy Zoning Office at Troy City Hall shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the City. Section 1.4 Replacement of Official Zoning Map In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the City Council may by resolution adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original Official Zoning Map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: “This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) a part of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Troy, Alabama.” Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendments. Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 2 | P a g e  ARTICLE TWO RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES Section 2.1 Boundary Interpretations Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply: 2.11 Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines. 2.12 Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 2.13 Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be construed as following such City limits. 2.14 Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main track(s). 2.15 Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed to follow such shore lines, and in the event of change in shore line shall be construed as moving with the actual shore line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. 2.16 Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections 2.11 through 2.15 above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 2.17 Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by subsections 2.11 through 2.16 above, the Board of Adjustments shall interpret the district boundaries. 2.18 Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of the Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may permit, as a Special Exception, the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot. Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 3 | P a g e  ARTICLE THREE APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS Section 3.1 Zoning Affects Every Building and Use The regulations set by this Ordinance within each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, and particularly, except as hereinafter provided: 3.11 No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall be hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 3.12 No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered: 3.121 To exceed the height or bulk 3.122 To accommodate or house a greater number of families 3.123 To occupy a greater percentage of lot area 3.124 To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards, or other open spaces than herein required; or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this Ordinance. 3.13 No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this Ordinance, shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for another building. 3.14 No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this Ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this Ordinance. 3.15 All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be considered to be in the RR: Reserved Residential District, until otherwise classified. Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 4 | P a g e  ARTICLE FOUR NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND, NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, NON- CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES, AND NON-CONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE Section 4.1 Continuance of Non-Conforming Uses Within the districts established by the Ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance of future amendment. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that non-Conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 4.11 Extension of Non-Conformities: Non-conforming uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment of a building or premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 4.12 Construction Prior to Adoption: To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. 4.121 Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. 4.122 Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on in accordance with Section 4.121 within thirty (30) days of adoption of this Ordinance. Section 4.2 Non-Conforming Lots of Record In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in this district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations or the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment. 4.21 If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, such lands shall be able to change ownership, and be constructed upon. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, by variance, reduce or waive the yard requirements on non-conforming lots where enforcement of the yard requirements would create an excessively small or narrow building area. The Board shall, in its deliberation on an appeal for a variance, take into consideration typical existing yards in the  Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 5 | P a g e  general area where the non-conforming lot is located, giving particular attention to existing uses and setbacks on adjacent properties.

Toward this end, by the Zoning Ordinance the Council has requested site plan review by the Planning Administrator for all land development that can be expected to have an impact on natural resources, traffic patterns, and on adjacent land usage. Site Plans shall comply with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws, codes, regulations, ordinances, and requirements and the following provisions: 6.51 Subdivisions: Any subdivision or resubdivision of land, or combining of lots within the City of Troy, and within unincorporated areas lying within three (3) miles of the Troy City limits, shall be carried out in accordance with the Troy Subdivision Regulations, as amended, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Ordinance. 6.52 Site Plans: This Section shall apply to all site plans as required in Section 6.53. The site plan procedures shall be required in order to ensure that site-specific development projects meet the requirements of this Ordinance prior to the issuance of approval by the Planning Administrator. Site plan approval is required before application and issuance of any building or applicable permits, but shall not constitute approval of such permit. It is the intent of this Section that the approved site plan be an integral part of the building permit application process, and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the site will be constructed and inspected prior to occupancy of the development. 6.53 Development Requiring Site Plan Approval: In addition to compliance with other requirements imposed by this Ordinance, site plan review and approval by the Planning Administrator shall be required for all proposed non-residential construction, mobile home parks / developments, manufactured home parks / developments, retirement or assisted-living facilities, nursing homes, recreational vehicle park developments, multi-family structures, and developments with more than one residential structure per tract or lot prior to issuance of any applicable permits.

For all proposed development in which it is unclear if site plan approval is required, the Planning Administrator shall determine if site plan approval is necessary. 6.54 Submission and Review: An application for site plan review shall be submitted on the application form provided by the Planning Department. The application shall include all information as requested on the application form. Preliminary review with the Planning Administrator, prior to a formal application is encouraged. If the application is not complete, the Planning Department shall notify the applicant indicating necessary steps to cure the incomplete application. The application shall be submitted with drawings showing the location of the site and all existing and proposed improvements with sufficient information to evaluate impacts on adjacent properties. Sheet size shall be large enough to document all physical features and shall be suitable for public record. The application does not require public notice nor public hearing. The City Council may, at its discretion, establish by resolution a fee to cover the costs of the site plan review. Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 78 | P a g e  Except as otherwise required by law or administrative procedures, all required county, regional, state or federal agency approvals shall be obtained prior to the submission of an application for Site Plan Review. At his/her discretion, the Planning Administrator may waive this requirement in whole or in part to allow the processing of permit applications at various other levels of government to proceed concurrently with Site Plan Review. The site plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Administrator and may be referred for review and report by other City departments and appropriate officials. The review will take into consideration the requirements set out in this Ordinance and may also take into consideration compliance with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws, codes, regulations, and ordinances. The Planning Administrator may refer any site plan to the Planning Commission for its consideration and approval. The Planning Department shall notify the applicant of the approval or disapproval of the site plan. In the case of approval, specific changes, if any, required to be made shall be stated. If such changes require alterations to the site plan, the Planning Administrator may require such site plan to be resubmitted for site plan review and approval once said alterations are incorporated. 6.55 Site Plan Content: The site plan shall contain all information as reflected on the current Planning Departmental check list for a site plan, which said check list may be modified at the discretion of the Planning Administrator, when applicable. For development sites of one (1) acre or more, full engineering drawings must be submitted by an engineer registered in the State of Alabama. At the Planning Administrator’s discretion, the same requirement may be applied to sites of less than one (1) acre where the Planning Administrator determines that the plan proposes uses or activities that may have a substantial impact on surrounding properties.

Adequate provisions for surface and stormwater drainage; and 7. Compatibility with surrounding land uses. 6.57 Approval of Site Plan: Site plan approval is required before application and issuance of any building or applicable permits, but shall not constitute approval of such permit. Upon final approval of a site plan, no structures, uses, or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development site except in accordance with the site plan and related approved plans. Upon approval of a site plan, the Planning Administrator shall stamp, sign and date the site plan, then forward a copy of  Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 79 | P a g e  the approved site plan to the Building Department noting such approval with any noted conditions or stipulations. Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction drawings to the Building Official for permitting. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Building Department from accepting for review and processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions as may be established by that department relative to processing of site plans prior to final approval. In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a site plan approval and such approval is on file in the Building Department. All building and construction permits issued for any project requiring site plan review shall be consistent with the approved site plan. The approval of a site plan shall not under any circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the applicable City requirements for construction or installation of structures or materials. Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such construction details occurs, the more restrictive or that requiring the higher standard shall prevail. 6.58 Expiration of Site Plan Approval: Approved site plans shall remain valid for eighteen (18) months after final approval, and a building permit for the development may be obtained during that time period, if all other requirements of this Ordinance have been met. The Planning Administrator may make one extension of site plan approval for a single period up to six (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire. An extension may be granted if the Planning Administrator concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension request. Requests for any extension in excess of the one six (6) months extension shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant shall submit a new application for review in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 6.5 of this Ordinance. 6.59 Amendment, Revision of Site Plan: A site plan, and site plan approval, issued thereon, may be amended upon the request of the applicant. Such amendment shall be made upon application and in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 6.5 of this Ordinance.

An erosion and sediment control plan shall be a part of the construction plans for all developments in Spanish Fort's corporate limits and planning jurisdiction. Such plan shall accompany any application for subdivision or zoning approval, building permit, excavation or other construction activity whenever the proposed activity is to be undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, or more than one contiguous acre is to be uncovered.4 8.2 PLAN SUBMISSION AND REVIEW. Whenever there is an area to be disturbed comprising more than one acre, three (3) copies of the erosion and sediment control plan shall be filed with the Building Inspector at the time the application for Land Use Certificate and Building Permit are submitted. A copy of the plans shall also be on file at the job site. If the Building Inspector and/or the City Engineer determine, either upon review of such plan or on - inspection of the job site, that a significant risk of off-site sedimentation or erosion exists, a revised plan shall be prepared and submitted. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, the work shall be either suspended or continued under conditions outlined by the Building Inspector and the City Engineer.4 8.3 PLAN CONTENT. Erosion and sediment control plans shall contain architectural and engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations and narrative statements as needed to accurately describe the proposed development of the site and the measures planned to meet the Basic Control Objectives. Plan content may vaFy to meet the needs of the specific site conditions, but the plan must show, at a mininmm, the best management practices (BMP's) which will be used to control site erosion during and after construction. Examples of best management practices shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: Mulching Sodding Diversion berms Sedimentation catch basins Clean up practices Recreational area storage Diversion structure Ponds Retain natural vegetation Aeration of soils 4 Detention basins Porous pavements Holding tanks Infiltration systems Channel storage Minimize disturbed land area Minimize the duration of exposure to the natural elements 8.4 PROTECTION OF PROPERTY. Persons engaged in land-disturbing activities shall take all  reasonable measures to protect all public and private property, including roadways, from damage by such activities. 8.5 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES. The basic control objectives which should be considered in developing and implementing an erosion and sediment control plan are to: 8.51 Identify Critical Areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off­ site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention. 8.52 Limit Exposed Areas. All land-disturbing activities should be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time. 8.53 Limit Time of Exposure. All land-disturbing activities should be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time. 8.54 Control Surface Water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment Joss during exposure.4 8.55 Control Sedimentation. All land-disturbing activities should be planned;, and conducted to minimize off-site sediment damage.4 8.56 Manage Stormwater Runoff. When any land disturbing activity increases the peak rates and velocity of stormwater runoff into receiving ditches or stream channels, plans indicating the management of stormwater runoff shall be submitted and approved by the City Engineer. These plans shall include measures that control both the velocity and rate of increased runoff to minimize erosion and sediment deposition in the ditch or stream channel. 4 8.6 STANDARDS. 8.61 Mandatory Standards. No land-disturbing activity subject to these provisions and guidelines shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following requirements: 8.611 8.612 No land-disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake, natural watercourse or adjacent property, unless a buffer zone is provided along the boundary of sufficient width to confine visible siltration and/or prevent erosion, provided that the land-disturbing activity is not in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over or under a lake, natural watercourse or adjacent property.4 The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within 30 working days of completion of final grading, be planted or  otherwise provided with ground cover, devices or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. 8.613 Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one contiguous acre is uncovered, a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be planted or otherwise provided within 30 working days on that portion of the tract upon which further active construction is not being undertaken, provided that this activity shall not apply to cleared land forming the basin of a reservoir later to be inundated. 8.62 Design and Performance Standards. Erosion and sediment control measures, structures and devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide control from the calculated peak rates of runoff from a ten-year frequency storm. Runoff rates may be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Services ""National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices,"" or other acceptable calculation procedures. Runoff computations shall be based on rainfall data published by the National Weather Service for the area. All plans will be subject to review by the Building Inspector and the City Engineer.4 8.7 OTHER REQUIREMENTS. 8.71 Permanent Downstream Protection of Stream Banks and Channels. Provision:shall be made for the permanent protection of off-site stream banks and channels from the erosive effects of increased velocity and volume of stormwater runoff resulting from certain land-disturbing activities. 8.711 8.712 A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all highway construction; commercial, industrial, educational, institutional, and multi-family developments of one acre or more; and for single-family developments of five (5) acres or more.4 Detention, storage and controlled release will not be required in those instances where the person planning to conduct the activity can demonstrate that the stormwater release will not cause an increase in accelerated erosion or sedimentation of the receiving ditch, stream channel, or other drainage facility, taking into consideration any anticipated development of the watershed in question. 8. 72 Borrow and Waste Areas. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is obtained shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste material originated. When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate land­ disturbing activity. 8.73 Access and Haul Roads, Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity. 8.74 Operations in Lakes or Natural Watercourses. Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction, in, on, over or under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel. The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow characteristic is provided.4 8.8 RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE. The person engaged in or conducting the land­ disturbing activity shall be responsible for maintaining all temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control measures and facilities during the development of a site. The responsibility for maintaining all permanent erosion and sediment control measures and facilities, after site development is completed, shall lie with the landowner. 8.9 ADDITIONAL MEASURES. Whenever the Building Inspector and/or the City Engjgeer determines that significant erosion or sedimentation is occurring as a result of a.;l!l!ld­ disturbing activity, despite application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity or the person responsible for maintenance will be required to take additional protective action.4  ARTICLE IX COASTAL PROTECTION 9.1 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1. Ordinance No. 51-96 of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, the Zoning Ordinance, is hereby amended by adding Section 7.9 as set forth below: 7.9 RADIO. CELLULAR RADIO CELLULAR TELEPHONE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS, ANTENNAS, DISHES AND RELATED ACCESSORY STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum location requirements, siting criteria and development standards for wireless connntmications facilities consistent with the Federal Teleconnnunications Act of 1996, as amended. No radio, telephone or wireless connnunications or transmitting towers and antennas, or their associated structures or equipment, shall be erected or constructed without first complying with the provisions of this ordinance and all applicable State and Federal rules and regulations. The underlying principles of these standards are to: (1) achieve a balance among the munber, height and density of wireless connnunications facilities that is appropriate for our cornn1unity; (2) encourage and maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings and other structures to acconnnodate new wireless connnunications facilities; (3) ensure the compatibility of towers with, and avoid the adverse impacts to, nearby property; and ( 4) discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the City of Spanish Fort. 7.91 Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to the terms used in this Section: Accessory Structure Compound. A fenced, secured enclosure in which a wireless communications facility and its equipment, buildings, access roads, parking areas and other accessory devices/auxiliary structures are located. Alternative Support Structure. At,y structure other than a wireless connnunications tower, which may include, but is not limited to, buildings, water towers, light poles, power poles, telephone poles and other essential public utility structures. Antenna Support Structures. Any structure on which wireless connnunications antennas and cabling can be attached. (See also Communications Tower and Alternative Support Structure.) Co-location. The placement of more than one wireless connnunications antenna by one or more service providers on a singie existing or approved antenna support structure or connnunications tower. Connnunications Antem1a or Antenna. A device used to transmit and/ or receive wireless connnunication services as authorized by the Federal Connnunications Commission, including all mounts and supporting structures. Connnunications antennas typically include:  2 a. Microwave dish -- parabolic antennas that emit microwave signals. b. Panel antenna -- vertical and horizontal plane antennas that aim radio signals in specific directions. (Also referred to as sector antennas.) c. Whip antenna -- cylindrical antennas which emit radio signals in a 360- degree horizontal plane and a compressed vertical plane. (Also referred to as stick, omni-directional or pipe antennas.) Communications Tower or Tower: Any ground-mounted structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more communications antennas. Communications towers shall include: a. Monopole towers -- cylindrical self-supporting towers constructed as a single spire. b. Self-Supporting or Lattice towers -- self-supporting towers with multiple sides of open-framed supports. c. Guyed towers -- towers anchored with guy wires. d. Camouflaged towers -- self-supporting towers concealed such that they blend in with their surroundings. Such towers may be constructed to resemble objects, such as a tree or a street light, or may be concealed within another structure, such as a clock tower, church steeple, flag pole or lamp post. Concealment or Camouflage Techniques. Design techniques used to blend a wireless communications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the existing surroundings so that the appearance is not of a wireless communications facility. Such structures shall be considered wireless communications facilities and not spires, belfries, cupolas or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for purposes of applying height limitations. Due to their height, such structures must be designed with sensitivity to elements such as building bulk massing and architectural treatment of both the wireless communications facility and surrounding development. Concealed towers or communications antem1as on developed property must be disguised to appear as either a part of the structure housing a principal use or an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed towers or communications antennas developed on unimproved property may be required to be disguised to blend in with existing vegetation. Example: A tower of such design and treated with architectural material so that the tower is camouflaged or disguised to resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches (also known as a ""monopine"").

Where a connnunications antenna is to be installed within or on an existing strnctnre in any business district, the setbacks shall be as reqnired for the existing strnctnre and the nse district in which the strnctnre is located, withont regard to the antenna height. 7 .924 Strnctnral Design of Towers. Every new tower constructed shall be of monopole design, nnless the applicant for good canse shown can demonstrate that the specific conditions reqnire another tower type. 7. 925 Aesthetics. The aesthetic properties of each individual wireless connnnnications facility shall be approved as part of the site plan review process. 4 a Towers and antennas. The design of the tower and antennas shall be of a type that has the least visual impact on the surrounding area. The following minimum requirements must be observed: (I) Towers and antennas shall be painted a neutral or blending color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness, unless otherwise provided or required by any applicable F.A.A. standards or the Planning Commission. If an anteuna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting communications facility must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure, or as otherwise required by the Planning Commission. (2) No signage, symbols or advertisements may be attached to the pole, tower or antenna, unless otherwise required by local, state or federal laws, rules or regulations. (3) Towers camouflaged to resemble woody trees or indigenous vegetation in order to blend in with native landscape will be subject to review, as are other types of concealment techniques. (See Concealment or Camouflage Techniques.) b. Accessory Structures. (1) The design of the wireless communications facility and its accessory structures shall, to the extent possible, maximize the use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower and wireless conununication facilities with the surrounding natural setting and built environment. (2) In or adjacent to developed properties, accessory structures must be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment. Materials such as wood, brick and stucco should be used as appropriate. The use of metal or metallic-looking material shall be avoided as much as possible. c. Non-vegetative screening. (1) Non-vegetative screening will be required when it is necessary to reduce the visual impact of a wireless communications facility on adjacent public ways, properties or the neighborhood in which it is located. In or adjacent to developed properties, non-vegetative screening shall be provided in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding character of development, buildings, natural vegetation and landscaping. Such screening, as required, is subject to site plan review, shall have a minimum height of eight feet (8'), and may consist of one of the following: brick, masonry walls, solid wood fencing, berms or opaque barriers. All non­ vegetative screening shall be properly maintained by the property owner or lessor. (2) In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote, agricultural or rural locations, or developed heavy industrial areas, the non-vegetative screening requirement may be reduced. (3) The screening requirements may be reduced on wireless communications facilities utilizing underground vaults rather than above ground equipment buildings. d. Landscaping. In addition to the landscaping and buffer requirements set forth in Article VI and X, the following provisions shall also apply:  5 (1) Landscaping will be required to reduce the visual impact of the wireless communications facilities on adjacent public ways, properties or the neighborhood in which it is located. In or adjacent to developed properties, landscaping shall be provided in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding character of development, buildings and natural vegetation. (2) The perimeter of the accessory structure compound shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the compound from adjacent property and public ways. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip of at least ten feet (1 O') wide outside the perimeter of the compound. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirements may be reduced. (3) Where the property on which the wireless communication facility is located abuts, or is in close proximity to, a residential district or residential use, additional buffering may be required by the Zoning Administrator. ( 4) A row of trees a minim nm of eight feet (8 ') tall and a maxim nm of ten feet (1 O') apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the compound fence. A continuous hedge of at least thirty (30"") inches high at planting and capable of growing to at least thirty-six (36"") inches in height within eighteen (18) months shall be placed in front of the tree line.

REPLACEMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the City Council may by resolution adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original Official Zoning Map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: ""This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Fort Payne, Alabama."" Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
