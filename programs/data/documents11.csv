Computations Of Sign Area and Height. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height. A. Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign’s face is expressed in square footage calculated from the total perimeter of the writing, display of color or any background material included in the sign’s design, and encompasses all the sign’s graphic components and symbols. The area calculation will be based on a combination of circles, rectangles, squares, triangles, etc., as appropriate. The sign’s face is differentiated from the backdrop or structure to which it is fixed, and does not include the supporting framework, bracing, or wall which supports the sign face. If a sign’s components, such as complete words, phrases, and graphics are proposed for a façade without being attached to a singular cabinet or background, the area of said components may be calculated separately. Individual characters shall not be calculated independently from one another. B. Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. C. Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at grade level to the top of the highest attached component of the sign, including border, trim, frame, supports, and all other structural members and appurtenances. 6.10.16. Permitted Signs in HN, TN-3, TN-2, TN-1, R-1, R-2, and R-3 Districts. See Table 6-7 for sign type, position, density, area, and height regulations. A.

In the event an applicant seeks a Certificate of Occupancy prior to all required improvements being installed, a Performance Agreement shall be in the amount of 110 percent of the actual estimated cost as determined by the engineer or landscape architect of record, and affirmed by Engineering Services and Community Development and based on the recommendations of city departments. The Performance Agreement shall secure site improvements and private access improvements required pursuant to this ordinance, including necessary off-site improvements. 7.1.2. At the time the applicant requests to enter into a Performance Agreement, the applicant shall submit a letter to the Engineering Services and Community Development in which he agrees to have a registered professional engineer or landscape architect, depending on the type of improvements, involved in the construction phase of the project for the purpose of monitoring construction in order to determine conformity with approved plans and specifications. 7.1.3. The period within which required improvements shall be completed shall not exceed one year from the date the Performance Agreement is signed; however, extensions and reductions may be approved by the Engineering Services and Community Development in accordance with this chapter. 7.1.4. The Performance Agreement shall name the city as obligee and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. The Performance Agreement shall remain in force in its full face amount until improvements are completed and accepted by the Engineering Services and Community Development or appropriate city departments, whichever is applicable. The Performance Agreement may be reduced as provided in Section 7.3, Reduction or Release of Performance Agreements. §7.2. Surety Required 7.2.1. A Performance Agreement authorized by the Engineering Services and Community Development shall be secured by either an irrevocable standby letter of credit with an automatically renewable feature, (often termed as an “evergreen” letter of credit), a cashier’s check, or other method of surety deemed adequate by Engineering Services and Community Development. The beneficiary of the surety shall be the City of Athens. 7.2.2. The financial institution shall permit the letter of credit to be presented for collection at a place physically located within Limestone, Madison, or Morgan County, Alabama. Alternatively, for site plans and final plats approved by the Planning Commission or Administratively, the financial institution may choose to provide a means for facsimile presentation, under the following conditions: A. Financial institution must operate a minimum of one branch or office open to the public, located in Limestone, Madison, or Morgan County, Alabama. B. Presentation of draw documents by Beneficiary shall also be permitted via overnight courier service to the financial institution’s department where issuance of letters of credit transpires. C. Facsimile number(s) for presentation shall be printed in the letter of credit, with a statement that modifications to, or discontinuation of, facsimile numbers shall be provided to the Beneficiary via amendment. D. A means of backup shall be provided in the letter of credit, for an occasion when the facsimile number is inoperable for any reason: 1) Backup shall include either a physical location address in Limestone, Madison, or Morgan County, Alabama, to be accessed only if the facsimile number is inoperable for any reason; or, 2) Financial institution shall print in the letter of credit that if for any reason the facsimile number noted in the letter of credit is inoperable at a time when Beneficiary is attempting to present draw documents, then draw documents shall be considered timely when the financial institution is presented with a facsimile machine transmittal showing an attempted presentation by Beneficiary, along with satisfactory draw documents. §7.3. Reduction or Release of Performance Agreement and Surety 7.3.1. The Performance Agreement may be reduced one time by the Engineering Services and Community Development. 7.3.2. A request for reduction of the surety or release of the Performance Agreement shall be submitted to Engineering Services and Community Development. The appropriate city department may release the Performance Agreement, extend the Performance Agreement, or reduce a surety. 7.3.3. Extensions of Performance Agreements shall be as determined by the appropriate city departments but shall be for no greater than one year. 7.3.4. A request for reduction of the surety or release of the Performance Agreement shall not be granted until all of the following have been completed: A. The applicant shall present a letter to the Engineering Services and Community Development requesting reduction of the surety, including the percentage amount of completion of the improvement, or release of the Performance Agreement, including a written statement from the engineer or landscape architect employed by the applicant stating that the improvements have been installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. B. The appropriate city department has submitted a statement to the Engineering Services and Community Development indicating that the required improvements and/or required landscaping have been inspected and satisfactorily completed in accordance with the approved plan. 7.3.5. Once such a written statement from the engineer or the landscape architect has been received stating that the improvements have been installed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the appropriate city departments, an inspection by the relevant department shall be performed at no cost to the applicant. 7.3.6. At the time an extension, reduction or release of a Performance Agreement is approved, the Engineering Services and Community Development or other appropriate city department, whichever is applicable, shall establish the expiration date of the Performance Agreement. However, the maintenance obligation or Performance Agreement shall not have an expiration date of greater than one year. 7.3.7. No Performance Agreement shall be reduced to less than twenty-five percent (25%) of its full-face amount, irrespective of the estimated cost of completing the improvements. The amount of reduction shall range from fifty percent (50%) to seventy-five percent (75%) of its full-face amount, contingent upon the actual amount of completion of the improvements. 7.3.8. The applicant’s costs incurred in connection with a request for the extension, reduction of the surety or release of the Performance Agreement and surety (that is, landscape architect or engineering inspections fees, legal fees, and so forth) shall be borne by the applicant, regardless of whether his request is ultimately granted. §7.4. Deferred Improvements Program. The City recognizes that there are occasionally unique circumstances, typically where small, start-up businesses are concerned, where required improvements are to a scale that makes obtaining a bond or letter of credit, and frontloading a project with capital investment for all required improvements is unduly burdensome. It is the intent of this section to offer an alternative means of getting site improvements constructed while being cognizant of the challenges faced by start-up, small businesses. This section shall only apply where the applicant is seeking to locate within an existing building and nonconforming improvements are required by Sec. 3.7 if this ordinance. 7.4.1. Program Standards. The City, at its discretion, shall be free to offer an applicant the opportunity to defer improvements to a property according to the following: A. The applicant has a site plan drawn by a professional engineer or landscape architect. B. The engineer or landscape architect develops a schedule for required improvements set over the course of time set in this section. C. The schedule for improvements, with associated percentages of the total cost of improvements, shall be as follows: 1) 25% of the total improvements are due at the time a Certificate of Occupancy is issued. 2) 50% of the total improvements shall be in place one (1) year following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. 3) 75% of the total improvements shall be in place two (2) years following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. 4) 100% of the total improvements shall be in place three (3) years following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. D. The applicant shall enter into a contract with the City, agreeing to the terms of this section and ensuring that 100% of the required improvements are made within the course of time set by this section. Within the contract, the applicant will agree that the issuance of a City business privilege license for their business is contingent on their meeting the obligations of this section. 7.4.2. Alternative Program for Deferred Parking. An applicant may submit a request to defer the construction of up to 50 percent of the required number of parking spaces specified in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, or Table 6-3, Off-Street parking Standards for Selected Industrial Uses, if the request complies with the following standards: 1) Reserve Parking Plan. The request is accompanied by a Reserve Parking Plan identifying: (a) the amount of off-street parking being deferred, and (b) the location of the area to be reserved for future parking, if needed, and (c) spaces are drawn to show how it could be built to meet parking standards including dimensional, accessibility requirements, grading, drainage, lighting, landscaping, signage, and all other requirements for a site plan. 2) Parking Demand Study. Adequate assurance is provided that within 12 months after the initial Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the proposed development, the applicant will submit a Parking Demand Study to the Engineering Services and Community Development that demonstrates the parking demand for the development and the adequacy of existing parking spaces. If the study indicates that the existing parking is adequate, then the construction of the remaining number of parking spaces shall not be required. If the study indicates additional parking is required, it shall be provided consistent with the Reserve Parking Plan and the standards of Section 6.5, Off-Street Parking and Loading. 3) Limitations on Reserve Areas. Areas reserved for future parking shall be brought to the finished grade and shall not be used for buildings, storage, loading, or other purposes. 4) Landscape Required. If ultimately developed for off-street parking purposes, areas reserved for future parking shall be landscaped with an appropriate ground cover and shall comply with all relevant landscape standards of this ordinance. 5) Total required handicap parking is developed in the initial phase.

For non-standard corner lots, that lot line which is generally parallel to the front lot line of lesser dimension. For the purposes of determining rear yard setbacks on a lot where the side lot lines meet in a point, the rear lot line shall be assumed to be a line not less than ten (10) ft long drawn within the lot between the two side lot lines and parallel to the front lot line, and shall be referred to as the “adjusted rear lot line”. Side lot line. Any lot line, which is not a front or rear lot line. For non-standard corner lots, that lot line which is generally parallel to the front lot line of greater dimension.

Especially for industrial projects. �Figure’s side yard setback does not have text to back it up and it contradicts sec. 6.3.3.A(1), but 6.3.3.B(3) tacitly backs this up. �Make sure this table doesn’t span two pages. �Content neutral way to allow political signs. Political signs, according to the Supreme Court Opinion in the Gilbert case, cannot be shown favoritism over other temporary signs (not content neutral). Either they have to play by the same rules or the enforcement of the temporary sign regulations needs to be suspended during an election. �As written this is confusing and it seems to override the Table 6-7.

Authority and Enactment Clause. The City Council of the City of Gulf Shores, Alabama, hereinafter referred to as “the Council”, in pursuance of the authority granted by Title 11, Chapter 52, Article 4, Sections 70-84 inclusive, Code of Alabama, 1975, hereby ordains and enacts into law the following sections. §1-2. Short Title. This Ordinance shall be known as and may be cited as “The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Gulf Shores, Alabama.” §1-3. Purpose. The zoning regulations and districts as herein set forth are made in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purposes of guiding development to meet existing and future needs and to protect, promote and improve the public health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity, and general welfare of the residents. These regulations are designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. These regulations are made with reasonable consideration, among other things, of the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to promoting desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, protecting property against blight and depreciation, securing economy in governmental expenditures, and conserving the value of land, Buildings and Structures. §1-4. Scope. No Building, Structure, or land shall hereafter be used, occupied, and no Building, Structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless in conformity with all the regulations of this Ordinance for the district in which it is located, except as otherwise provided herein. §1-5. Interpretation. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the protection, promotion and improvement of the public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare of the community. It is not intended by this Ordinance to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of Buildings or Premises or upon the height of Buildings, or requires larger Open Spaces than are imposed or required by other Ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this Ordinance shall control. If because of error or omission in the zoning map any property in the City is not shown as being in a zoning district, the classification of such property shall be R-1-1 unless changed by amendment to the zoning map or by subsequent Zoning Ordinances. §1-6. Validity. In the event any court of competent jurisdiction should hold that any Article, Section, Subsection, Paragraph or Item, clause or provision of this Ordinance is invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof, other than the part so declared to be invalid. §1-7. Re-enactment and Repeal of Previous Zoning Ordinance. This Ordinance amends and in part carries forward by re-enactment some of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Gulf Shores, adopted on February 18, 1963, as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue in force such existing provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued hereunder are preserved and may be enforced. All provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Gulf Shores adopted on February 18, 1963, as amended, which are not re- enacted herein are hereby repealed. All suits at law or in equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from the violation of any zoning resolution heretofore in effect, which are not pending in any of the courts of this State or of the United States, shall not be abated or abandoned by reason of the adoption of this Ordinance but shall be prosecuted to their finality the same as if this Ordinance had not been adopted; any and all violations of the existing Zoning Ordinance, prosecutions for which have not yet been instituted, may be hereafter filed and prosecuted; and nothing in this Ordinance shall be so construed as to abandon, abate, or dismiss any litigation or prosecution now pending, and/or which may heretofore have been instituted or prosecuted. §1-8. Effect Upon Outstanding Building Permits. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, size, construction or designated use of any Building, Structure or part thereof for which a Building Permit had been granted by the City before the time of passage of this Ordinance; provided, that where  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  1-2 construction is not begun under such outstanding permit within a period of sixty (60) days subsequent to passage of this Ordinance or where it has not been prosecuted to completion within eighteen (18) months subsequent to passage of this Ordinance, any further construction or use shall be in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 2-1 Article 2: Using this Ordinance  ARTICLE 2: USING THIS ORDINANCE §2-1. Organization. This Ordinance is organized as follows: A. For purposes of organization, this Zoning Ordinance, is divided into twenty-two (22) Articles.

Each Article within the Zoning Ordinance is subdivided into several major headings known as Sections, which are represented by the second digit; e.g., in the reference number §6-4A1, the digit “4” represents the Section. C. Each Section within the Zoning Ordinance is subdivided into Subsections, which are represented by the upper- case letter following the Section designation number; e.g., in the reference number §6-4A1 the letter “A” represents the Subsection. D. Each Subsection within the Zoning Ordinance may be subdivided into Paragraphs, which are represented by the digit following the Subsection designation; e.g., in the reference number §6-4A1 the digit “1” represents the Paragraph. E. Each Paragraph may be subdivided into Items, which are represented by the lower-case letter following the Paragraph designation; which may then be further subdivided as (1), (2), (3)... (a), (b), (c)…and (i), (ii), (iii)… §2-2. Internal Referencing. All references to Articles, Sections, Subsections, Paragraphs and Items within this Ordinance shall refer to Articles, Sections, Subsections, Paragraphs and Items in this Ordinance unless otherwise specified. When an Article, Section or other subdivision is referenced within a provision or requirement of this Ordinance, unless otherwise specified, all subdivisions within such reference shall be assumed to be applicable. §2-3. Page Numbering. Each Article contains its own separate page numbering system. The page numbers are prefixed by the respective Article number. As an example, page 10 of Article 8 is designated page 8-10. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  2-2 This page intentionally left blank. 3-1 Article 3: Administration ARTICLE 3: ADMINISTRATION §3-1. General Procedure. A. General Sequence of Steps. All persons desiring to undertake Excavation, new construction, Structural Alteration, or changes in the use of a Building or Lot shall apply to the Building Official for a Building Permit by filling out the appropriate application form and by submitting the required fee. Where no Excavation, new construction, or Structural Alteration is to occur, but where a new use or new occupancy is to occur on an existing Premises, a Certificate of Occupancy shall be required. The Zoning Official will then either issue or refuse the Building Permit or Certificate as appropriate or refer the application to the Council or BZA. After the Building Permit has been issued to the applicant, the applicant may proceed to undertake the action permitted in the Building Permit. If the Building Official finds that the action of the applicant has been taken in accordance with the Building Permit, or where no construction is proposed and the desired occupancy conforms with this Ordinance, a Certificate of Occupancy shall then be issued allowing the Premises to be occupied. B. Other Reviews or Permits Required. Certain development requests may also require Conditional Use Permits (CUP), Site Plan Review, Variances, and/or Land Disturbing Activity Permits. Procedures for Variances by the BZA are described in Article 17. All other permits and review procedures are described in this Article. C. Zoning Official. The Director is hereby designated to be the Zoning Official. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Official to enforce and administer the provisions of this Ordinance and to interpret the meaning of the Ordinance in the course of enforcement. He may delegate the responsibility for the enforcement and administration of this Ordinance to members of his staff. §3-2. Building Permit and Land Disturbing Activity Permit Required. No Building or Structure shall be erected and no existing Building shall be moved, altered, added to, or enlarged until a Building Permit therefore has been issued by the Building Official. No Excavation, grading, or similar land disturbing activity shall occur until a Land Disturbance Permit has been issued by the Public Works Department. A. Building Permit Types. Under the terms of this Ordinance, the following classes of Building Permits may be issued: 1. Permitted Use: A Building Permit for a permitted use, including permitted uses subject to Article 11 Specific Use Regulations, may be issued by the Building Official only upon confirmation from the Zoning Official that the proposal is in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance. 2. Conditional Use/Site Plan Review: A Building Permit for a Conditional Use or for a use subject to Site Plan Review may be issued by the Building Official only upon approval of the Conditional Use or Site Plan in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Article. 3.

Building and Land Disturbance Permits shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days at any time after the work is commenced. An unexpired permit may be extended, upon approval by the Building Official, for a period of no more than 180 days. A permit shall not be extended more than once. §3-3. Site Plan Review. A. Purpose. The economy of Gulf Shores is dependent upon its continued appeal as a Beach resort community and its ability to attract tourists and other visitors. The community is located in a fragile coastal environment, which is highly sensitive to development pressures. Therefore, to ensure that the development of certain uses are properly guided, Site Plan Review shall take into account the following objectives: 1. Future development must be harmonious with the beach resort character of the community; 2. Future development must not adversely affect the City's physical infrastructure; 3. Future development must be compatible with the natural environment; and, 4. Future development must not be otherwise harmful to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of residents and visitors. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  3-2 B. Site Plan Review Required.

Prior Compliances and Approvals. An application for a Site Plan Review shall be made to the CDD prior to an application for a Building Permit. a. Except as otherwise required by law or administrative procedures, all required county, regional, state or federal agency approvals shall be obtained prior to the submission of an application for Site Plan Review. At his discretion, the Zoning Official may waive this requirement in whole or in part to allow the processing of permit applications at various other levels of government to proceed coincidentally with Site Plan Review.

Staff Review. Upon receipt of a Site Plan application, the Zoning Official shall have ten (10) working days to determine the appropriateness and completeness of the information presented in the submission and accept or reject the application.

Within thirty (30) working days after receipt of a Site Plan Review application, the Zoning Official shall refer said application, together with all supporting documentation and staff recommendations, to the Commission for its review and recommendations. 3. Consultants Review. The City may, if in its opinion it is necessary, retain consultants to assist in the review of an application for Site Plan Review.

He shall submit a letter of intent to revise to the Zoning Official who, upon receipt of the letter, will halt the normal review processing. Within fifteen (15) days after receiving revised documents, the Zoning Official will review the revisions and forward his comments and recommendations to the reviewing authority. Each of the reviewing bodies shall have thirty (30) working days to act on the revised Site Plan and the entire review process shall be similarly extended in time. 6. Building Permit and Expiration of Site Plan. a. Upon Site Plan approval, the Building Official may, upon application, issue a Building Permit for a portion or all of the proposed development after he finds that the application is in compliance with all applicable City, County, State, and Federal requirements. b. If within two (2) years of the date of approval of an application for Site Plan Review, a Building Permit has not been obtained, the approved Site Plan becomes null and void. Site Plan shall also become null and void upon expiration of the Building Permit. c. Reauthorization Clause. Within 30 days following the prescribed expiration date, for good cause, the Planning Commission may reauthorize an expiring Site Plan a single time for a period not to exceed two (2) additional years.

Changes After Approval. a. Minor changes to an approved Site Plan may be authorized by the Zoning Official to overcome unanticipated hardships or conditions provided that such minor changes: (1) are not inconsistent with provisions of this Ordinance; (2) are not inconsistent with the design concept of the approved Site Plan; (3) do not add additional Stories in height; (4) do not add additional Dwelling Units. b. Other changes or amendments to an approved Site Plan shall be submitted to the reviewing authority for approval. D. Public Hearing. A public hearing is not required during the Site Plan Review process. E. Findings. The granting or denial of approval by written Resolution of the reviewing authority shall include not only conclusions but also finding of fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the grant, with or without changes and/or special conditions or for disapproval, and said Resolution shall set forth with particularity in what respects the plan would or would not be in the public interest including but not limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the following: 1. In what respects the plan is or is not consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the purpose and intent of the applicable district. 2. In what respects the plan is or is not in conformance with all applicable regulations of the applicable district. 3.

F. Submission Requirements. Applications shall be accompanied by narratives, drawings, and other information as required by the CDD. The Zoning Official may waive submission requirements if, in his opinion, the requirements are not essential to a proper decision on the project or the Zoning Official may establish additional requirements for Site Plans to clarify the nature of proposed development. G. Appeals to the City Council. Applicants shall have no more than fifteen (15) working days in which to file an appeal to the Council regarding the decision of the Commission on a Site Plan application.

Whether or not the development plan has received all required state and federal approvals and permits 3. Whether or not the proposed site development plan is compatible with the goals and stated plans of the City and other governmental agencies for the area, as applicable 4.

Public amenities provided on the site 14. Other factors determined to be relevant by the Commission In granting any CUP, the City may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms of the Conditional Use Permit, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. D. City Council Review. The Council shall consider the recommendation of the Zoning Official and the Commission, review the standards for approval or disapproval of the application, and shall take action on the application. The Council may approve the application, approve with conditions, or deny the application. E. Limitation on Re-Submission.

This decision is at the sole discretion of the Zoning Official. F. Expiration. A CUP shall expire and become null and void if not acted upon within twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. The permit shall be deemed to have been “acted upon” when a completed application for a Building Permit (or Certificate of Occupancy where applicable) has been received by the Building Department in conjunction with the CUP. If said Building Permit expires (see §3-2D Expiration) at any time after the twelve (12) month period, the CUP shall be voided.

This district exists for the protection of areas that are, or are planned to be, developed for Single- family Dwellings or Duplexes. 8. R-3 Residential/Limited-Density Multiple-family District. This district exists for the protection of areas that are, or are planned to be, developed for attached housing in central neighborhoods. Permitted densities are limited so that compatible relationships can be maintained between all Dwelling types. 9. R-4 Residential/High-Density Multiple-family District. This district exists for the protection of areas that are, or are planned to be, developed for high- Density attached housing in central locations within the community. Other uses compatible with relatively high residential densities are permitted. 10. R-5 Residential/Manufactured Home and Recreational Vehicle Park District. This district exists to provide space at appropriate locations consistent with community objectives for the establishment of Manufactured Home Parks and Recreational Vehicle parks. 11. BN Neighborhood Business District. This district is intended to provide a transitional Buffer between commercial or industrial activities and nearby residential neighborhoods. Non-residential uses are limited to those that can be compatible with the residential character of Adjacent neighborhoods. 12. BG General Business District. This district is intended to provide locations for a specified range of retail businesses and services, offices, Hotels, Motels and other compatible uses serving community needs, where an attractive appearance of Buildings and their Premises is important to the successful conduct of business. 13. BT Tourist Business Districts. These districts are intended to provide suitable locations for walkable, Mixed-use Developments consisting of Hotels, Motels, Condominiums, Multiple-family Dwellings and compatible Commercial Uses that provide residents and tourists with services, conveniences and amenities. There are five separately designated and separately regulated variants of the BT District: a. BT-1 Low-Medium Density Tourist Business District b. BT-2 Medium Density Tourist Business District c. BT-3 Medium-High Density Tourist Business District d. BT-4 High Density Tourist Business District e. BT-5 Maximum Density Tourist Business District f. BT-1-N: Tourist Business, 1, North 14. BA Arterial Business District. This district is intended to provide locations for a variety of commercial and light industrial activities along the main entrance highway to the City and at other locations where similar development may occur. An attractive appearance along the highway is essential if the City is to maintain its tourist resort image and ensure the continuing vitality of its local economy. An attractive appearance is also essential  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  5-2 to the successful operation of many commercial and industrial uses permitted within the BA District. Among the uses permitted, some require open sales Lots for the display of merchandise and others customarily store goods, materials, and equipment in open storage areas. Regulations for the District are intended to ensure that such open display areas or storage areas are Screened or landscaped so that they are compatible with other permitted uses and with the desired appearance of the City's main entrance highway. 15. ATP Amusement/Theme Park District. This district is intended for major amusement and/or Theme Parks on land Parcels of twelve (12) acres or more, in locations where their operations are compatible with existing or planned surrounding development and where Thoroughfares can accommodate traffic generated. Regulations permit customary uses for such parks along with decorative Structures, signs, pennants, and other devices that are appropriate to identify themes and provide a feeling of pageantry. The use of such devices are regulated to prevent unsightliness or visual clutter along a public Thoroughfare. Through required Setbacks, Buffers and Screening, and by other means, the regulations minimize adverse impacts of noise and other nuisances on surrounding properties. 16. ICW-N Intracoastal Waterway-North and ICW-S Intracoastal Waterway District-South.

IND Industrial District. This district is intended to provide a suitable protected environment for manufacturing, research and wholesale establishments which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or objectionable emissions, and generate little industrial traffic. Industrial parks are encouraged. This district is also intended to provide locations for manufacturing and processing industries, service industries, warehousing, or research and testing operations that, due to employment of heavy equipment or machinery or to the nature of the materials and processes involved, require special locations and development safeguards to prevent pollution of the environment by noise, vibration, odors or other factors. Such industries may require sites extensive in size and served by adequate utilities service and transportation. 18. OS Open Space and Preservation District. This district is established to preserve and maintain lands for outdoor recreation, parks, and related activities, both public and private. This district may also be used to identify Alabama State lands intended to be preserved in their natural state. 19. ED Education District.

Access Standards. All subdivisions and all Multiple-family, Mixed-Use and Non-residential developments, redevelopments and changes in use shall be subject to the Access Management Standards adopted by the City and as herein described. Accesses existing, as of the effective date of these standards, shall be approved for the existing use only. Access, under these standards, shall be approved only for the use being proposed and as specified in a required Access Plan. Changes in use that would increase traffic or change the type of vehicles accessing the site shall require a new approval of access. When a site, existing at the time of these standards, is redeveloped in a manner so as to create a Significant Increase in Trip Generation, as defined in Article 4, all existing Driveways shall be brought into conformity with these standards. §6-12. Outdoor Lighting Standards. A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that all exterior lights and Illuminated Signs are designed, located, installed and directed in such a manner as to prevent objectionable Light Trespass and Glare across property lines, and/or Direct Glare at any location on or off the subject property. The “maintained Horizontal Luminance recommendation” set by the Illuminating Engineers Society of North America (IESNA) as shown in Appendix C of City Ordinance 1461 shall be observed. B.

Intracoastal Waterway Districts include the ICW-N and ICW-S Districts and shall be developed in accord with the objectives and general regulations in Subsections A and B following. A. Objectives. Within the Intracoastal Waterway Districts, the City intends to: 1. Encourage urban scale waterfront development that facilitates walking and pedestrian interaction between neighboring uses. 2. Encourage a logical arrangement of innovative high quality “Mixed-use” developments that include residential, commercial, Marina, and tourist uses. 3. Establish a common maritime theme for all waterfront development. 4. Establish developmental guidelines and land use patterns that serve to preserve property values and enhance the quality of life for residents of both the north and south banks of the Intracoastal Waterway. 5. Lessen the potential impact of north bank development on the residential properties located along the south bank of the Waterway by regulating both Building Heights and Building Setbacks from the north bank of the Intracoastal Waterway. 6. Enhance streetscape treatments along Waterway West Blvd., E. 28th and 29th Ave., E. 2nd St., and Waterway East Blvd. in order to encourage new business development and to encourage the redevelopment of existing sites. 7. Encourage the creation of a linear Greenway along the Intracoastal Waterway for the purpose of preserving its environmental and aesthetic qualities and to encourage active public interaction with this important waterfront asset. B. General Regulations and Area and Dimensional Modifications for ICW-N and ICW-S Districts. 1. Modifications to the Setbacks required by this Ordinance may be approved by the approving authority when it is clearly demonstrated that the modification is in the best interest of the City, enhances the functionality and aesthetics of the project and would not cause an adverse impact upon Adjacent properties. 2. In no case will any Structure or appurtenances thereto be permitted to violate any provision of the FAA-FAR Part 77 and/or Ordinance 831, as amended. All Structures greater than fifty (50) ft in height shall be required to obtain an official determination from the FAA as to whether the Structure constitutes a hazard to air navigation and results in a detrimental effect on Jack Edwards Airport. 3. All Buildings and parking facilities located upon the site shall be designed to ensure the free and safe flow of pedestrian and bicycle traffic both within and around the site. To this end, pedestrian and/or bicycle interconnections between Building sites shall be provided as an integral element of the overall development plan as well as pedestrian friendly amenities such as benches, pedestrian landings, drinking fountains, bicycle racks, pedestrian lighting, Open Space, etc. 4. Pedestrian Improvements made within the Corps easement Adjacent to the Intracoastal Waterway that are consistent with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan and the intent of this Section may offset some or all of the customary on-site pedestrian Improvements if such Improvements are deemed by the City to be more desirable or advantageous. All such Improvements are subject to approval by the by the Corps. 5. Each development shall plan for and construct their portion of a multi-use pathway of at least twelve (12) ft in width or as otherwise recommended by applicable AASHTO standards. The pathway shall be located within the Corps’ easement Adjacent to the ICW, or along the southern edge of the property where no easement exists, consistent with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. The precise location of the pathway will be determined through the Site Plan Review process and it is recognized that for the purpose of maintaining continuity across a site, certain activities may require extreme realignments. Flexibility will also be allowed to address specific site issues, the natural characteristics of the property, and enjoyment of the Adjacent water resource. The design and materials used in the construction of the path should be consistent, to the extent necessary, to maintain a common theme throughout the path and illustrate the paths “public” nature. Enhancements and embellishments will be allowed Adjacent to the path to represent the different developments that the path passes through. 6. All proposed development shall incorporate appropriate Buffering and Screening techniques to minimize the potential for incompatibility between Adjacent uses as may be required in §12-2 Screening and §12-3 Buffers. 7. Lighting for all development shall incorporate design elements that shall prohibit the direct illumination of Adjacent property, ROW or the Intracoastal Waterway in accord with §6-12 Outdoor Lighting Standards. 9-3 Article 9: Special District Regulations 8. Existing trees and vegetation located within unopened ROWs and the Corps easement shall be preserved to the extent practicable to provide for an appropriate Buffer and to improve the visual aesthetics of the property from the north. The removal of trees shall be allowed in accordance with the City Tree Preservation Ordinance. 9. For determining FAR and Building Coverage, GFA shall: a. Include elevated parking floors and parking areas, such as decks and garages, contained entirely within the exterior faces of exterior walls and/or supporting columns of the Principal Building, when located on or above the second Habitable Story of a Structure; b. Exclude elevated parking floors and parking areas, such as decks and garages, to the extent contained within the exterior faces of exterior walls and/or supporting columns of the Principal Building, that are located on or below the first Habitable Story; and c. Include all elevated parking floors and parking areas, such as decks and garages, or portions thereof, that extend outward from the exterior faces of exterior walls and/or supporting columns of the Principal Building or that are detached from the Principal Building, whether covered or not. Ground level parking lots, above or below the base flood elevation (BFE), shall not be included in the calculation for the GFA; and d. Mean that area within the external limits of the “exterior faces of the exterior walls and/or supporting columns of the Principal Building,” including but not limited to: habitable space (i.e., guest rooms for rent or occupancy), elevator shafts, stairwells, common walkways, balconies, storage and mechanical rooms, and other related enclosed space. 10. Outdoor activities, including but not limited to outdoor dining, are encouraged but are subject to approval through the Site Plan Review process. Consideration shall be given to proximity to residential development and zoning; the nature of the activity and noise levels related thereto; proposed hours of operation, and any other relevant factor. 11. An engineer-certified Stormwater Management Plan is required for approval by the City. The Stormwater Management Plan shall indicate the specific Best Management Practices that would be required for collecting, filtering and pre-treating all stormwater runoff from the property prior to discharge in order to meet the standards of the state and federal governments, including National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements. 12. Other Regulations Applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this §9.3, the following general regulations shall also apply: a. Supplementary Regulations.

City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  9-16  This page intentionally left blank. 10-1 Article 10: Overlay District Regulations ARTICLE 10: OVERLAY DISTRICTS §10-1. Intent: The purpose of an overlay district is to allow for the application of specific regulations to distinct geographic areas within the City. These geographic areas warrant special consideration due to their unique situations or prominent locations. Existing conditions and development are such that it is impractical to apply underlying zoning district regulations and achieve the goals of the City as established in the Future Land Use Plan. The effect of an overlay district will be to encourage property development which will maintain the unique characteristics of an area or create a new character of development as envisioned by the City’s Future Land Use Plan. It is the intent of this article to provide an instrument for establishing supplemental standards for overlay districts. §10-2. Procedure: A. General. The supplemental standards for Overlay Districts are pre-determined as set forth in this Article. Once these determinations have been incorporated into a plan, then projects shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of Article 3-3 Site Plan Review. B. Deviations. Deviations from strict compliance with underlying zoning and overlay district standards may be allowed if such deviations are found to comply with the goals and intent of the Future Land Use Plan. Applications requesting deviations from zoning standards shall follow the conditional Use Permit review and approval process (Article 3-4 Conditional Use Permit) (CUP) §10-3. Walking Area Overlay District. A. Use Regulations. See §8-5 for BT (1-5) Districts and the provisions herein. 1.

Incentive Bonus Density and Building Height. 1. Intent. In order to promote the local economy and improve public welfare and convenience, the City desires to promote the private provision of adequate and well-designed public spaces and Improvements that provide additional public beach access, parking, civic spaces, and other public amenities and conveniences for both residents and visitors. 2. Authority. As part of the development of property in BT (1-5) Districts within the Walking Area Overlay District, at its option the Council may grant to the property owner a bonus number of Dwelling Units, GFA, and Stories of Building Height for a proposed development as an incentive to encourage the appropriate location, design, dedication and development of additional public parking spaces and Improvements Adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico that are accessible and convenient to the public. The bonus shall be in addition to the maximum GFA, FAR, Dwelling Units and Stories otherwise authorized by the applicable district in Article 8. Development authorization pursuant to this provision shall be subject to Site Plan Review by the Council as provided in §3-3. The grant of a bonus and the  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  10-2 amount of such bonus shall be discretionary with the Council, and there shall be no automatic entitlement or right to any such bonus. 3. In consideration for providing approved public parking and/or Public Improvements and facilities meeting the requirements of this §10-1C3 in conjunction with authorized private development, the Council may, at its option, grant bonuses to the property developer, in accordance with the schedule shown in Table 10-1B. Such bonuses shall be limited to the lesser amounts indicated in accord with the following: a. The developer must select one of the options listed in Items 1, 2, or 3 to receive any bonus. b. A developer may claim bonus Density for Item 4, only if he/she has also satisfied all requirements of and received approval from the City for Item 3 for the same property. c. When more than fifty (50) public parking spaces are provided, all those in excess of fifty (50) spaces shall be part of a parking deck. d.

City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  10-18  Figure 10-8B 1: WV-O Illustrative Master Plan The illustrative version of the Waterway Village-Overlay Plan demonstrates a possible future pattern of development specific to the existing conditions and opportunities in the area. Specific details of this illustrative plan may change over time but the fundamental character, qualities, and intentions will remain intact. Credit NNC v1.0 adapted by Sandy Sorlien Illustrations by DPZ & Co. from SmartCode 2010    10-19 Article 10: Overlay District Regulations C. Organization The WV-O District is divided into 5 transect zones which stipulate specific regulations for certain areas of the WV-O District. The transect zones are described and graphically displayed on the Regulating Plan Section 10-8F. The regulations prescribed herein regulate the form, design, scale, intensity and performance of public spaces, building form and private parking standards to ensure that new developments exhibit the highest standards of urban design, architecture, and streetscape standards at the scale of the neighborhood, block, lot and building. 1. Public Space Standards Public space standards address thoroughfares and green spaces. Thoroughfares are intended for use by vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian. Thoroughfares generally consist of vehicular lanes and public frontages. Thoroughfares should be designed to be walkable with pedestrian comfort and safety as critical goals along with the safe and efficient flow of traffic, accommodations of emergency vehicles, parking, utilities and storm water. Green Spaces are intended primarily for pedestrians and bicyclists. Refer to Section10-8 Public Space Standards, for the Thoroughfare and Green Space Standards. 2. Building Form Standards Building form standards consist of building placement, frontage types and architectural design guidelines. Building placement relates to the scale of buildings in relation to lot size and dimensions (e.g. location and size of facades, required yard locations and size, setbacks, etc.) Refer to Section 10-8I & J, Building Form Standards, for building placement standards for each transect zone. Frontage is the specific way that a building or structure addresses a thoroughfare. Frontage types combined with building placement strengthen urban character and support a pedestrian oriented environment. Refer to Section 10-8I and 10-8J Building Form Standards, for building frontage standards for each transect zone. Design guidelines are evaluation criteria of building massing and modulation, façade composition, fenestration, and architectural elements and detail. Refer to Section 10-8I and 10-8J Building Form Standards, for architectural design standards for each transect zone. 3. Private Parking Placement. Private parking placement standards establish performance measures for the type, number of spaces, and access to parking areas. By regulating private parking, quality of place and walkable neighborhoods are achieved. Refer to Section 10-8D 4, 10-8I and 10-8J for the Private Parking Standards for each transect zone. D. Applicability The provisions contained herein shall apply to all lands as identified on the Official City of Gulf Shores Zoning Map as being within the WV-O. 1. Performance Regulations. The text standards, tables and figures are an integral part of the WV-O regulations. The diagrams that accompany the text and tables should be considered guidelines and where in conflict, text and tables shall take precedence over graphic diagrams. 2. Conflicting Provisions. The WV-O functions separately from the regulations of Zoning Ordinance. Zoning Ordinance regulations are relied upon in limited and special circumstances as noted throughout the WV-O District. Except where explicitly provided to the contrary, whenever the requirements of the WV-O regulations are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or ordinances, the requirements of the WV-O District shall govern. 3. Maximum Density. Maximum Density shall be allowed pursuant to the underlying Zoning District or a maximum of 20 units per acre, whichever is greater. Mixed use developments shall be allowed a maximum 10% bonus density above the standard requirements. 4. Parking Standards. In an effort to promote compact pedestrian development the WV-O District is designed to provide extensive public parking and reduced on- site parking for individual uses. Public parking facilities, mixed-use development, and shared parking between uses will allow a smaller parking supply meet the combined peak parking demands of the district. The following parking requirements apply in the WV-O District. a. Requirements (1) Minimum parking space requirements shall be calculated at a rate of fifty percent (50%) of the standard rate as established by Article 14 of the Zoning Ordinance. (2) Maximum parking space requirements shall be calculated utilizing the standards as established by the Required Minimum Off- street Parking Spaces Table in Article 14 of the Zoning Ordinance. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  10-20 (3) Restaurants, Lounges/Bars, and Lodging Uses, required parking spaces shall be calculated utilizing the minimum parking space standards established by the Required Minimum Off-street Parking Spaces Table in Article 14 of the Zoning Ordinance. A maximum 50% of parking spaces shall be constructed on-site. Minimum on-site parking shall be determined via the review process. On street parking spaces immediately adjacent to the frontage line shall be counted as required parking. b. On a case-by-case basis parking reductions may be allowed by the approving authority in accord with the following provisions or a combination thereof: (1) Local Parking Demand Study. In accordance with Article 14 or Table 14-2B of the Zoning Ordinance, reduced parking requirements supported by a parking demand study, may be approved if the parking demand study determines acceptable levels of parking exist within 750 feet of the subject site. (2) Public Parking Credits. The approving authority may reduce the required parking spaces for all uses when public parking credits have been purchased from the City towards spaces in a public parking facility within 750 ft of the subject sit and in conformance with Article 14 of the Zoning Ordinance. 5. Storm Water Management Standards. Due to the mixed-use infill development of the WV-O District, best management practices for stormwater management differ from suburban practices. Compact development creates fewer pollutants by reducing expansive lawns and parking lots. This subsection allows the use of a variety of best management practices to meet stormwater management standards. The use of these practices and their functional equivalents are presumed to comply with the stormwater management standards contained in Chapter 7, Article 5 of the Code of Ordinances Erosion and Sedimentation Control. Innovative and urban stormwater management designs and techniques may be considered for addressing stormwater treatment requirements, including but not limited to porous pavement, treatment inlet boxes with skimmers or traps, subsurface basins for infiltration or detention, prefabricated multi-chamber water quality devices, green roofs, stormwater treatment mitigation, rain gardens, bioswales, etc. All stormwater management designs and techniques must be certified by an Alabama professional engineer or other appropriate professional who is competent in the fields of hydrology, drainage, and flood control. Drainage plan submittals shall include at a minimum the requirements of Chapter 7, Article 5 of the Code of Ordinances Erosion and Sedimentation Control, a proposed maintenance schedule for each technique, identifying the timing of inspections and the maintenance activities that will be taken such as removing debris from inlet boxes, replacing filters, pumping out accumulated sediment, mechanical sweeping, etc. and any other submittal requirements of the Director of Public Works. Stormwater attenuation requirements may be waived for sites provided that post-development conditions do not exceed the maximum predevelopment discharge rate or whereby runoff retention/detention is part of a regional stormwater management facility. This consideration is granted provided that the site provides stormwater treatment for 150 percent of the site and adequate downstream capacity exists for the proposed discharge rate when considered within the context of the total watershed discharge and its timing. 6. Landscaping. The landscape, screening, and buffering provisions of Article 12 of the Zoning Ordinance do not apply to properties within the WV-O District with the exception of the following sections of the Zoning Ordinance. a. 12-1 E. Parking Lot Landscape Standards b. 12-1 G. Landscape Plan Submittal Requirements c. 12-1 H. Minimum Plant Specifications d. 12-1 K. Tree Credits, and e. 12-1 M. Tree Protection Methods 7. Supplementary Regulations. See Article 6 for supplementary regulations. These regulations apply to the WV-O District unless waived by the approving authority. 8. Outdoor Lighting. See Article 6-12 Outdoor Lighting Standards 9. Sign Regulations. See Article 18 E. Use Regulations 1. The allowable uses shall be determined by the underlying Zoning Districts with the following exceptions:   10-21 Article 10: Overlay District Regulations Restaurant Drive-in/Drive through are not allowed in the WV-O District. 2. Uses permitted “by right” are indicated with an “R” and uses permitted by Conditional Use Permit are indicated with a “CUP” and are subject to the procedures of Section 3-5 Conditional Use Permit. a. R – Bed and breakfast b. CUP – Farmer’s market, supply, produce store c. CUP – Seafood Market/Seafood exchange d. R – Transit Terminal e. R – On-Street Parking f. CUP – Parking Structures g. R – Public Water Access h. R – Mixed-Use/Live-Work i. CUP – Marina j. CUP – Commercial Fishing Facilities k. CUP – Boat Construction Facilities l. CUP – Boat Docks & Wharves m. CUP – Mobile Vendor Court F. General Procedure. 1. The use, form, design, scale, intensity and performance regulations for the WV-O Zone are pre- determined as set forth in this Article. Once these determinations have been incorporated into a plan, then projects shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of Article 3 Site Plan Review. The Planning Commission shall review the application and make a recommendation of compliance, noncompliance, or compliance with conditions. The application shall be forwarded to the City Council for final approval; the Council may approve the application, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Site Plans submitted in accordance with the WV-O District shall show the following, in compliance with the standards described in this Section: a. Use b. Building Placement c. Building Frontage d. Building Design (including color-rendered elevations) e. Parking Location Standards f. Landscape Standards g. Erosion and Sedimentation Control h. Signage Standards i. Special Requirements, if any 2. Special Districts. Special Districts do not have provisions within this Code shall be governed by the standards of the pre-existing zoning. Conditions of development for existing Special Districts shall be determined in public hearings as required by Section 15-6 PUD Master Plan approval. The establishment of new Special Districts shall be in accordance with the minimum PUD size and review and approval procedures as set forth by Section 15 Planned Unit Development. Special Districts are intended to comply with the general purpose and design of the WV-O District. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  10-22  G.

Screening. A. Generally. Screening is intended to visually separate conflicting uses between Adjacent properties and shall be designed to be compatible with the surrounding environment. For the purposes of this section, “fences” and “walls” shall have the same meaning. B. Applicability. For all developments subject to Conditional Use or Site Plan Review, the following shall require Screening: 1. Garbage collection, including dumpsters, recycle bins and/or refuse handling areas 2. Service entrances, maintenance areas or utility Structures associated with a Building or development 3. Water meters, gas meters, electric meters and air conditioners/mechanical units 4. Loading docks or spaces 5. Outside runs for veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and Kennels 6. Outdoor vehicle, Manufactured Home, farm equipment, and similar sales Lots  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  12-6 7. Outdoor Storage of materials, stock, equipment, and vehicles (such as those stored for repair) 8. Any other uses for which Screening may be required by the reviewing authority C. Safety Provisions. 1. Screening shall not compromise safety by obstructing any required Clear Sight Triangle. 2. Screens shall not Block access to any above-ground, pad-mounted transformer and shall provide the minimum clear distance required by the utility company. 3. Screens shall not impede or divert the flow of water in any drainage way. D. Design Requirements. The method of Screening, including height and materials, shall be that which is sufficient to visually screen the use. The minimum height needed is preferred. Fences, Berms, or Landscaping used for other purposes, but that are proposed as part of a required screen and that meet the requirements of this section, may count toward Screening requirements. The design of Screening shall be in accord with the following and as approved during any applicable review: 1. Location of uses. Location on site should be the first consideration in Screening the uses listed in §12-2B above. The reviewing authority may lessen the requirements of this subsection, as applicable, where the location of the use to be Screened reduces its visibility to the public and to neighboring properties to which the use would be objectionable, by reason of views, noise, or odors. a. Uses requiring Screening, when co-located, may be Screened together. b. Uses that produce objectionable noise or odors shall be located so as to minimize such impacts to the public and Abutting properties. 2. Fences. All fences used for required Screening shall comply with the following: a. Fences shall be of masonry, ornamental metal, vinyl, durable wood, or a combination thereof. Untreated wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be permitted. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface, required as part of a Screen, shall be left open. The finished side of the fence shall face Abutting property. b. Where fences required for Screening are longer than fifty (50) ft in one direction, evergreen Landscaping shall be placed along the exterior side. Where such fences are longer than 100 ft in one direction, required Landscaping shall include both trees and Shrubs and the fence shall have columns of wood or masonry which project outward from the fence surface. Such columns shall be spaced no greater than fifty (50) ft oc. c. Fences located forward of the Front Building Line shall not exceed six (6) ft. Fences located in a required rear or Side Yard shall not exceed eight (8) ft in height. Fences used to screen service or Loading areas shall not exceed eight (8) ft in height, however, fences used to screen dumpsters shall be higher than the container. 3. Berms. Berms shall be landscaped and stabilized to prevent erosion and shall be a minimum height of four (4) ft with a maximum slope of three to one (3:1). Berms in excess of four (4) ft shall have a maximum slope of four to one (4:1) measured from the Lot Line. 4. Shrubs and trees. Except as herein provided, plantings installed toward Screening requirements shall be in accord with the general requirements and minimum planting specifications set forth in §12-1H Minimum Plant Specifications. Landscaping shall be maintained in accord with §12-1J Maintenance. a. Shrubs shall be evergreen and spaced no more than five (5) ft oc. b. Trees shall be evergreen and, when used in the absence of a fence, should have a low understory and/or be used in combination with Shrubs that together provide an effective Screen. c. Screening requirements for specific uses. d. Dumpsters, trash refuse, and recycling containers should not be located forward of the Front Building Line. Such containers shall be Screened by the combination of opaque fence or masonry wall and plant material on three (3) sides. Opaque gates, designed to complement the screen, shall be installed for access. e. For Restaurants, enclosures shall be sized, as needed, to accommodate the storage of grease containers. f. Mechanical equipment on roofs or on site shall not be visible from public ROWs or Adjacent properties and shall be totally Screened. The Screening of Building-mounted mechanical equipment shall be an integral component of the Building design. Mechanical equipment installed on site shall be adequately Screened by plant materials and/or fences and shall blend in with site Landscaping. 12-7 Article 12: Landscaping, Screening, Buffers g. Outdoor vehicle, Manufactured Home, farm equipment, and similar sales Lots shall be Screened by providing Street Frontage and Perimeter Landscaping requirements, in accord with §12-1 Landscaping. h. Outdoor Storage, where permitted, shall be effectively controlled according to the following requirements: (1) Outdoor Storage areas are prohibited in required Front Yards. (2) Uncovered and unscreened areas used for storage of live, vegetative products shall be designated on the Site Plan. (3) Screening shall be a minimum of six (6) ft high or two (2) ft taller than the material or equipment to be Screened, whichever is greater. (4) Loading berths shall be within the Building or concealed by means of a Screening wall of material similar to and compatible with that of the Building. (5) No designated or required parking spaces, fire lanes, sidewalks, landscape areas, retention/detention areas, or traffic lanes shall be used for Outdoor Storage. i. Service areas, Loading docks, work Yards, and similar uses should be located to minimize their visibility to the public and to any Abutting properties to which such uses would be objectionable. Where their location is insufficient to effectively screen the use, required Screening shall be at least six (6) ft in height. §12-3. Buffers. Buffers shall be provided in accord with the requirements of Table 12-3 and as described in this Section. In cases where Buffers are required or deemed necessary for the protection and/or separation of uses on Abutting Lots, the following provisions shall constitute the minimum requirements for each unless otherwise specified by the reviewing authority in individual cases. For the purposes of this Section, “fences” and “walls” shall have the same meaning, but shall not include the term “retaining wall”. Where Buffers are not required by this Section, the landscape requirements per §12-1 Landscaping shall be provided. A. General Requirements. Except as otherwise provided herein, Buffers shall be required based on the developing use and the existing, abutting use, regardless of whether the concerned properties are in the same or different zoning districts. 1. 100 percent of the applicable Buffer requirements shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, except when the new use is developed Abutting an existing more intensive use developed prior to the adoption of these standards and for which no Buffer is in place. In this case, the new use shall be responsible for providing a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required Buffer width as follows: a. Required Yards, where corresponding with the Buffer area, may overlap and may be counted toward the Buffer width requirement. b. The developer shall preserve existing vegetation within the Buffer width, which may be credited towards the Buffer requirement, or replace such vegetation with equivalent Landscaping. Equivalency of replacement Landscaping, if existing vegetation is removed, shall be determined by the reviewing authority. 2. Any required Buffer Abutting a park or Greenway may be reduced, if the property owner dedicates land to be set aside for all or part of the required Buffer width to the City as part of the park or Greenway. Such land dedication shall be deemed acceptable only upon approval of the City. 3. Buffer requirements may be modified by the approving authority as follows: a. Whenever the proposed use abuts an existing (nonconforming) use on a property that is designated for another use within the Comprehensive Plan and is zoned accordingly with the Comprehensive Plan, the required Buffer may be modified to be consistent with the projected use of the neighboring land. b. If the use relationships between two (2) Abutting Lots changes so that a lesser Buffer would be required, the width of the previously provided Buffer may be reduced accordingly. c. If the required Buffer abuts a public Alley, up to one-half (1/2) of the Alley width may be counted toward the Buffer width requirement but the Landscaping requirements shall not be reduced. 4. Whenever the proposed use abuts vacant land, Buffer requirements shall be based on the zoning of the Abutting property or the use projected by the Comprehensive Plan, whichever requires a lesser Buffer. When determining Buffer requirements based on the zoning or projected use of Abutting vacant land, the Zoning Official shall consider the range of possible future uses and base the requirement on the use(s) that require a lesser Buffer. When the proposed use and Abutting vacant land both lie in the same zoning district and such  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  12-8 district permits uses of greater intensity or Density than the proposed use, the proposed development shall provide half of the Buffer width that would normally be required between the proposed use and the projected use of the vacant land. 5. Golf courses, playfields, stables, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other recreational facilities; parking and other vehicular use areas; Buildings, dumpsters, and Outdoor Storage are prohibited in required Buffers. 6. Where desirable, the approving authority may permit a Pedestrian Access Way through a required Buffer. B. Height Buffers. Wherever a developing site, within one district, abuts another district with a more restrictive height allowance, the development shall be subject to a Height Buffer as described herein: 1. Along the Lot Line Abutting the district with the more restrictive height allowance, the subject Building or Structure shall be set back in accord with any required Side Yard or Buffer. At such distance from the applicable Lot Line, only a Building of such height as would be allowed in the Abutting district may be permitted except as provided in Item 2, below. (See Figure 12-3B) 2. For each foot the Building, or portion thereof, is set back from the Required Yard or Buffer, the Building, or portion thereof, may be increased in height two (2) ft up to the maximum height allowed in the Applicable District. (See Figure 12-3B) 3. For developments six (6) Stories or taller that abut a district whose maximum height is two (2) Stories or less, the Density of the required Buffer Landscaping shall be increased to that of the next more restrictive Buffer class (see Table 12-3) in addition to providing the additional height Buffer width as required herein. C. Design Requirements. 1. Trees and Shrubs shall be evenly spaced in accord with the densities shown in Table 12-3. 2. The Buffer width and Density of Shrubs may be reduced as shown in Table 12-3 when a fence is provided that meets the following standards: a. Fences shall be of masonry, ornamental metal, durable wood, or a combination thereof as approved by the reviewing authority. Untreated wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be permitted. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface, required as a part of a Buffer, shall be left open. The finished side of the fence shall face Abutting property. b. Fences shall be a minimum of six (6) ft high and no taller than eight (8) ft. c. For fences longer than fifty (50) ft in one direction, evergreen Landscaping shall be placed along the exterior side. Where such fences are longer than 100 ft in one direction, required Landscaping shall include both trees and Shrubs and the fence shall have columns of wood or masonry which project outward from the fence surface. Such columns shall be spaced no greater than fifty (50) ft oc. Figure 12-3B: Height Buffers Example: A developing site is located within a district with a maximum Building Height of 50 ft. Along its west Lot Line, the site abuts a district with a 35 ft maximum Building Height. A Buffer of 25 ft is required along its west Lot Line. Those portions of the Building set back 32.5 ft or more from the west Lot Line are allowed a maximum height of 50 ft (35 ft based on the Abutting district plus 15 additional ft for those portions of the Building set back 7.5 ft from the required 25 ft Buffer). Even if the Building were set back further, it would not be allowed to exceed the 50 ft height limit of its own district. D. Planting Requirements. Required Landscaping materials (plantings, walls, fences, pavers, etc.) shall be installed before a Certificate of Occupancy may be approved. Except as herein provided, plantings installed toward Buffer requirements shall be in accord with the general   12-9 Article 12: Landscaping, Screening, Buffers requirements and minimum planting specifications set forth in §12-1H Minimum Plant Specifications. 1. Existing natural vegetation, which meets, in whole or in part, Buffer planting requirements, may be applied toward the requirements of this Section. 2. No less than seventy-five (75) percent of required Shrubs shall be evergreen. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the required Shrubs may be deciduous. 3. Stormwater Management and drainage controls required by the City Engineer shall be coordinated with Landscaping Improvements and integrated into the overall site design. 4. Maintenance. Buffers shall be maintained in perpetuity by the owner in accord with the maintenance requirements set forth in §12-1J Maintenance. Failure to comply with these maintenance requirements shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the remedies and penalties provided in Article 3.

Purpose and Scope. The purpose of this Article is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of uses, Improvements and Structures, which do not conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. A. Continuance of Nonconformities. Any Nonconforming Use or Structure which otherwise lawfully exists and which has become nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this Ordinance, as a result of any subsequent reclassification of zoning districts or other amendment to this Ordinance, or as a result of subsequent annexation of the use or Structure into the corporate limits of the City may be continued or maintained only in accordance with the terms of this Article. B. Effective Date of Nonconformity. For purposes of this Article, the ""effective date of nonconformity"" shall mean the latest of (a) the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, (b) the effective date of the amendment to the Zoning Ordinance which first rendered the Structure or use nonconforming, or (c) the effective date of annexation of the Structure or use into the corporate limits of the City. §13-2. Nonconforming Uses. A. Expansion of Nonconforming Use. A Nonconforming Use shall not be expanded or extended beyond the floor area or Lot Area that is occupied on the effective date of nonconformity. B. Nonconforming Use of Structures and Premises. Except as otherwise provided herein, the lawful Nonconforming Use of a Structure or Premises existing at the effective date of nonconformity may be continued thereafter, although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. If no Structural Alterations, other than alterations permitted under §13-5 Alteration of Nonconforming Structures, are made, such Nonconforming Use may be changed to another Nonconforming Use of the same or a less nonconforming classification. 1. Whenever a Nonconforming Use has been changed to a less Nonconforming Use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use or Nonconforming Use, respectively. 2. The Nonconforming Use of a Structure may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a Building, which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of nonconformity. 3. The Nonconforming Use of a Premises may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a Premises, which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or improved for such use at the effective date of nonconformity. §13-3. Discontinuation of Nonconformities. A. Nonconforming Uses. If a Nonconforming Use is abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, then that use shall not be renewed or re- established and any subsequent use of the Lot or Structure shall conform to the use regulations of the Applicable District. B. Nonconforming Improvements. In the event the use of a property, on which nonconforming Improvements exist, including but not limited to, parking areas, Driveways, lighting, sidewalks, Buffers and Screening, and other Landscaping, becomes discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, such nonconforming Improvements shall be brought into conformity with the applicable provisions of this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or Business License. §13-4. Repair or Reconstruction of Nonconforming Structures. A. Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance. Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be made to a nonconforming Structure. B. Substantial Improvement. In this section, substantial improvement shall mean any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, where the permitted improvement equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. C. Substantial Damage. In this section, substantial damage shall mean damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it before damaged condition would be equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. D. Reconstruction. 1. If a nonconforming Structure is destroyed or damaged by any cause, and the cost of reconstructing the Structure to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to the destruction or damage does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the value of the entire Structure before the destruction or damage, then the Structure may be restored to a condition comparable to its nonconforming condition prior to the destruction or damage, provided that a Building Permit is secured and that reconstruction is started within one (1) year from the date of the destruction or damage, and such reconstruction is diligently pursued to completion. Under no circumstances may a nonconforming Structure be enlarged in any exterior dimension or be  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  13-2 otherwise made nonconforming to a greater extent or in a differing manner in the process of repair or reconstruction under this subsection. 2. If a nonconforming Structure is destroyed or damaged, and the cost of restoring the Structure to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to the destruction or damage exceeds fifty ( 50) percent of the value of the entire Structure before the destruction or damage, the Structure shall not be restored unless the Structure as restored, and the use thereof, will thereafter conform to all requirements of the zoning district and applicable flood zone requirements in which it is located and to all applicable requirements of the Alabama Coastal Area Management Plan. ABCDS. 3. Savings Clause Applicable to Certain Nonconforming Condominiums. Where a legal nonconforming building or structure is destroyed, it may be reconstructed or restored, subject to the following standards. a. A legal nonconforming building or structure damaged or destroyed by any natural disaster or phenomenon including a hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, fire, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, or other catastrophic event may be restored or repaired under this Subsection. b. A building permit for the repair or restoration shall be issued within five years of the date of the damage. c. These savings clause provisions shall be applicable only to legal nonconforming Condominium structures that are located within the Beach Overlay District, the Walking Area Overlay District, and Lagoon Pass Overlay District. d. The cost of restoring the damaged or destroyed structure must exceed fifty percent (50%) of the most current fair and reasonable market value of the structure before its damage. e. The damaged or destroyed structure may be reconstructed or restored only in a manner which recreates the same number of dwelling units or lodging units and the same gross floor area contained in the structure on the day before its damage or destruction. f. The reconstruction or restoration of a damaged or destroyed structure must in all other respects (setbacks, building height, building coverage, architectural design guidelines, and all other area and dimensional requirements of the Zoning Ordinance) be in compliance with all applicable provisions of this title, and such reconstruction or restoration is subject to all applicable enacted federal, state, or local laws adopted to protect public health, safety and welfare including, but not limited to, building fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes in place at the time of site plan approval application for reconstruction or restoration. E. Determining Value of Structures. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of an entire Structure before destruction or damage shall be determined as follows: 1. The value of an entire Structure before destruction or damage shall be determined by the current market value. Market value means the value of the structure (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by what independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values. F. Documentation Required for Restoration. For the purposes of this subsection, the cost of restoring the Structure to a condition comparable to its nonconforming condition prior to the destruction or damage shall be determined as follows: 1. At the time application for a Building Permit referable to the restoration work is made, the applicant shall submit, in addition to the documentation otherwise required for the issuance of a Building Permit, the following documentation: a. A certification by the licensed contractor or contractors who will be performing the restoration work, or if there is no contractor on the project, by the permit applicant that the cost of the restoration work described in the permit application will not exceed the cost declared in the permit application. b. A copy of all documentation relating to the market value of the Structure. 2. The certified cost declaration contained in the permit application will be accepted as the cost of restoration unless the Building Official determines that such declaration is materially inconsistent with the market value. In such event, the Building Official shall prepare a written determination of the cost of restoration for purposes of this subsection specifying the basis on which such cost of restoration has been determined. 3. In the event changes in the scope of the restoration work necessitated by the discovery of unanticipated damage elements or expense results in an increase in the cost of the restoration work after the submission of a certified cost declaration, a revised certified cost   13-3 Article 14: Parking Regulations declaration must be filed with the Building Official. If the Building Official determines on the basis of the revised certified cost declaration or on the basis of other information coming to his attention deemed reliable that the cost of the restoration work exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the entire Structure before destruction or damage, the Building Official shall order the suspension of any Building or other permits issued for the restoration work. §13-5. Alteration of Nonconforming Structures. A. Alteration or Enlargement. No alteration to or enlargement of a nonconforming Structure shall be allowed unless such modification conforms to the area and dimensional requirements for the Applicable District, except that at no time shall any such alteration or enlargement be allowed if the modification creates any other nonconformity with respect to these regulations. In addition, any such alteration or enlargement must be made in compliance with all other requirements of this Ordinance including specifically by without limitation Article 14 Off-street Parking and Loading and §3-3 Site Plan Review. B. Relocation. A nonconforming Structure shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other location unless every portion of such Structure and the use thereof is made to conform with all requirements for the zoning district to which such Structure is moved. §13-6.

Any person aggrieved by any decision or determination by the Zoning Official in the enforcement of this Article shall have the rights of appeal provided in Article 17 Board of Zoning Adjustment. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  13-4  This page intentionally left blank. 14-5 Article 14: Parking Regulations ARTICLE 14: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING §14-1. Required Off-street Parking. At the time of: 1) erection of any new Building; 2) establishment of any new use; 3) enlargement, expansion, or increase in capacity of any Principal or Accessory Building or use; or 4) conversion of a site or Building from one type of use or occupancy to another, such that the change or action creates a new or increases the previously existing parking demand for the site, Building, or use according to this Article, the site shall be improved as necessary to meet all of the requirements herein; including, but not limited to, required parking spaces, paving, layout and dimensions. A. Amount of Off-street Parking Spaces Required/Permitted. 1. Minimum required. The minimum parking ratios in Table 14-1B apply to each use on a site. The minimum parking shall be provided for every separate use on the site. In calculating minimum required parking, a fractional result shall be rounded down to the next whole number; however, when multiple uses are proposed on the same site, the fractional requirement for each use is added together prior to rounding. 2. Maximum permitted. To prevent the unnecessary creation of Impervious Surfaces and to further support compact, pedestrian-oriented development, uses shall not provide more than 125 percent of the parking required as a minimum in Table 14-1B within surface parking areas. This limitation shall not apply when the additional spaces are located in a Parking Structure. Furthermore, surface parking provided in excess of the minimum required shall be of an impervious paving as approved in accordance with §14-1D6. For uses not specified, the Zoning Official shall determine the required parking based on the most similar use in the Table subject to the following. B. General Standards and Modifications. 1. Location. a. Parking spaces for all uses or Structures shall be located on the same Lot with the Principal Use unless a Conditional Use Permit is approved for off-site parking. Remote Parking shall not be located more than 500 ft from the Lot on which the Principal Use to be served is located and the zoning classification of the property on which the Remote Parking is located shall be the same or a less restrictive classification. A written agreement assuring the continued availability of such off-site facilities shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form by the City Attorney and shall be filed with the Building Permit application. b. Driveways shall be designed and located such that the necessary or desired parking space shall not extend into a public right-of-way nor obstruct a public sidewalk. c. For all residential uses, the keeping of recreational vehicles, boats and trailers for more than forty-eight (48) hours shall only be permitted behind the Front Building Line. 2. Collective Provision of Parking Spaces. Two (2) or more Non-residential or mixed-uses may collectively provide Off-street Parking if the following conditions are met: a. Cumulative parking space requirements for Non- Residential or Mixed-use occupancies may be reduced where it can be demonstrated that the peak requirements of several occupancies occur at different times. Such reductions may be considered by the approving authority if supported by parking demand study. 3. On-street Parking. On-street public parking may be counted towards the required parking spaces for Abutting Non-residential uses. Only parking spaces fully contained within the Lot Frontage (as extended into the parking lane) may be counted. On-street Parking spaces that extend in front of two separate properties may not be counted toward either. 4. Public Parking and Parking Credits. The Zoning Official may reduce the required parking for a Non- residential or Mixed-use development when public parking credits have been purchased from the City toward spaces in a public parking facility within 500 ft of the subject use and in accord with the following: a. One and one-half (1.5) parking credits may be sold by the City per space in a public parking facility. b. The purchase of a parking credit does not reserve any parking space for purchasers, their employees or customers. The City shall have the right to charge individuals for use of public parking to assure turnover and maximize parking availability for the general public and for the uses that have purchased parking credits. c. The cost of a parking credit shall be established from time to time by the Council. Funds accumulated under the parking credit program are to be used by the City to create new or expand existing public parking facilities, and/or  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  14-6 improve pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the area to support use of public parking. C. Permit. A parking area permit approved by the Public Works Director shall be required for any parking area. D. Design Standards and Improvement Requirements. 1. Space Dimensions. Parking space dimensions shall comply with the provisions of Table 14-1D and as shown in Figure 14-1D1. a. Compact car spaces may be provided but shall not exceed a ratio of one (1) compact car space: three (3) standard spaces. Compact car spaces shall be a minimum size of eight (8) ft in width by sixteen (16) ft in depth. b. Handicapped spaces shall be provided as required by the Building Code. 2. Parking Area Dimensions. The design and dimensions of the parking area shall be in accordance with Table 14-1D and as shown in Figure 14-D1. a. Up to two (2) ft of vehicle overhang over a wheel stop may count toward the required length of a parking space. However, in such cases, the City Engineer may require additional aisle width. Vehicle overhang shall not project over a Lot Line, public ROW, sidewalk, required landscaped area, or internal walkway. b. The City Engineer may prescribe such traffic markers and or signs as deemed necessary to safely and efficiently manage traffic flow. Parking spaces, except those serving Single- family Dwellings and Duplexes, shall be demarcated with painted lines and/or signs or other markings accepted by the City Engineer. Stacking Spaces shall not be individually marked but instead shall be clearly demarcated to direct traffic, as necessary. Figure 14-1D1 (See also Table 14-1D) 3. Landscaping. The design and appearance of parking areas are intended to be compatible with the beach resort character of the community. Toward this objective, Off-street Parking areas of six (6) or more parking spaces shall be subject to §12-1 Landscaping. 4. Dead End Parking. Driveways and areas for internal circulation for parking of vehicles shall be designed to provide for safe and convenient circulation within the site. All parking lots must provide flow-through Driveways and dead end parking is prohibited. Ten   14-7 Article 14: Parking Regulations (10) or less consecutive parking spaces shall not be considered dead end parking. In extenuating circumstances when all other design options have been exhausted, the City may approve a striped area measuring a minimum of fifteen (15) ft by the full length of the parking aisle to be used as a vehicular turnaround area. “No Parking” and “Tow Away Zone” signage must be provided in vehicular turnaround areas in order to discourage vehicular parking. 5. Parking Lot lighting shall be provided within all parking lots and a lighting plan shall be provided by a qualified lighting provider. Light poles and fixtures shall be of the minimum height, type and number necessary to satisfactorily illuminate the parking lot. Lighting fixtures shall be designed to safely light parking areas without creating nuisance or hazardous situations for Adjacent property or Thoroughfares in accord with §6- 13 Outdoor Lighting Standards. An exemption to the lighting requirement may be approved by the Council if it is demonstrated by the applicant that the lighting of the parking lot is unnecessary or undesirable and that such an exemption will not create a safety problem. 6. Paving Standards. All parking spaces, Driveways and maneuvering areas shall be paved with asphaltic concrete, concrete, paving stone or masonry in compliance with standards adopted by the City Engineer. However, alternative paving may be approved pursuant to Paragraph 7 following. Required parking spaces shall be permanently marked and maintained and shall be accessible from a Driveway or aisle such that all vehicles approach the adjoining Thoroughfare in a forward motion. Restrictions and exceptions include: a. Detached Single-family Dwellings and Duplexes may substitute a ribbon-type Driveway (see Figure 141D6) or an unpaved all-weather surface, in compliance with standards adopted by the City Engineer, in place of a solid-paved surface. Vehicles may approach a Thoroughfare in either a forward or backing motion. This shall not apply to shared Driveways serving more than one such residences. Figure 14-1D6: Solid-paved and Ribbon Driveways b. All Driveways that cross an existing sidewalk or bike path shall be paved from the edge of pavement of the Thoroughfare to at least ten (10) ft from the back of the sidewalk or path, regardless of whether the parking on-site is required to be paved or not. See Figure 141D6. Ribbon-type Driveways shall be solid-paved from the back of sidewalk to the edge-of- pavement. c. In addition to Item b, above, all uses, whether required to provide paved parking or an unpaved all-weather surface, shall be required to pave all turn-outs and portions of Driveways located within any public or private rights-of-way up to a maximum of twenty-five (25) ft. In areas with unusually large ROW widths or where Driveways must cross extensive State or other governmental lands (such as Fort Morgan Road) for property access, Driveways shall be paved for their entire length within the ROW or state or governmental land. 7. Alternative Paving Standards. The reviewing authority may approve, following a recommendation by the City Engineer and Zoning Official, permeable paving surfaces in areas susceptible to flooding, and/or in zoning districts with restrictive impervious coverage standards. Pervious parking areas shall allow stormwater to percolate into the ground as designed as part of an overall stormwater management system in accordance with an approved site plan and the City of Gulf Shores Erosion Control, Sedimentation, Stormwater Runoff and Applicable Retention/Detention Ordinance. Permeable paving standards are as follows. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  14-8 a. All parking drive aisles, including ingress/egress aprons, shall be paved in accordance with the provisions of the Paragraph 6 Paving Standards above. b. Sub-surface soil testing shall demonstrate the manufacturer’s specifications will be met to allow for percolation and other stormwater functions. c. Permeable paving shall have at a minimum the following components; a durable load bearing pervious surface, a base course for stormwater storage and recharge, and a filter fabric. Permeable parking materials and installation procedures shall be in compliance with the manufacturers and/or industry standards. d. Gravel permeable paving shall be encapsulated by a minimum six (6) inch ribbon curb. e. Any stormwater piping associated with the permeable parking area, including pipe materials, sizes, slopes, and invert elevations at every bend or connection. f. Inspections. A state of Alabama registered professional engineer is required to design, make initial construction and annual inspections and tests as necessary to certify that construction of the permeable paving is consistent with the approved plans as well as the manufacturer’s standards. If maintenance is required the owner shall submit the following documentation: (1) Removal of visible surface sediment accumulations, and (2) Test results verifying the infiltration rate through the permeable pavement and base course materials system is in accordance with the approved permeable paving design and specifications. g. Repaving of pervious parking areas is prohibited unless approved by the reviewing authority. 8. Paving and Landscape Exemptions for Industrial Areas. Parking areas within the IND District may have the paving and Landscaping requirements contained in this Ordinance reduced subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit by the City Council. Modifications may include permitted use of substitute paving materials or reduced Interior or Perimeter Landscaping. Street Frontage Landscaping may only be reduced by the BZA when properties facing from across the Thoroughfare are also zoned as IND. 9. Drainage. Off-street Parking facilities shall be drained to prevent damage to Abutting property and streets and to prevent pollutants from draining onto the beach. Landscaped areas and perimeter areas shall be so graded as to receive a reasonable portion of the rainfall from the surrounding pavement. Protective curbing around landscaped areas, if provided, shall leave openings for the flow of water onto unpaved areas. §14-2. Parking and Loading in Specified Overlay Districts. A. General Provisions for Overlay Districts. Off-street Parking in the Lagoon Pass, Beach Area, and Walking Area Overlay Districts shall be as otherwise required in this Article, except as provided in §14-2B. 1. Limitation on surface parking. No surface Off-street Parking shall be located forward of the front Building Façade. 2. Lighting. All parking decks and any surface parking lots with more than ten (10) spaces shall be Illuminated in accord with §6-13 Outdoor Lighting Standards (and Turtle Lighting Ordinance 1461, as referenced therein). B. Parking Reductions in Overlay Districts. Off-street Parking and Loading in the Lagoon Pass, Beach Area, and Walking Area Overlay Districts shall be as otherwise required in this Article 14, except as provided herein. 1. Subject to approval by the Commission, minimum parking requirements for a Mixed-use Development may be reduced by calculation of Shared Parking Requirements for the development utilizing the Shared Parking demand information in Table 14-2B (or as otherwise provided in §14-2B3). These parking reductions shall not be available to Lodging Uses and Multiple-family residential uses unless such uses are part of a development also including non-Lodging, Non-residential uses. 2. Parking reductions may be allowed as part of Site Plan approval only if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that a combination of the following factors or measures are proposed by the development plan, including but not limited to: a. There are no material adverse impacts on parking conditions in the immediate vicinity. b. The development plan mitigates vehicular traffic impacts by proposing limited access to and from public Thoroughfares. c. The development plan proposes the creation of new or upgraded sidewalks or bikeways to help foster non-vehicular movement within, around and to the site. d. Public/private Open Spaces are provided with pedestrian and bikeway amenities (i.e., bicycle   14-9 Article 14: Parking Regulations racks, benches, open and landscaped areas, pedestrian landings, lighting, etc.). e. Additional landscape measures are taken beyond minimum City requirements to foster a high-quality beach attraction for tourists and further encourage pedestrian and bicycle access to the use or Premises. f. Safety signs, traffic signals, and crosswalks are implemented to help reduce any potential conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles. The Commission may also require a covenant be executed guaranteeing that the owner will provide additional spaces directly or by purchase of parking credits, if the City, upon investigation of the actual use of parking within two years of initial occupancy, finds there is insufficient parking, which must be proven by showing occupancy rates over 98 percent for a least two consecutive hours on at least three separate days within a single month. 3. Local Parking Demand Study. At their option, the developer may prepare a local parking demand study to generate parking demand figures more suited to the proposal, its combination of uses, and location than that provided in Table 14-2B. The study shall be prepared by a qualified parking or traffic consultant, licensed architect, city or urban planner or civil engineer. The study shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning Official the alternative parking demand figures it generates. The Commission may require the owner/developer to pay a fee to be applied towards the cost of a parking study of actual parking accumulation to be carried out within one to two years of occupancy.

Purpose. The purpose of Planned Unit Development, hereinafter referred to as “PUD”, regulations is to encourage flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to implement the goals of the Land Use Plan; to encourage Mixed-use developments; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets, utilities and public spaces; and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. The procedure is intended to permit diversification in the location of Structures and improve circulation facilities and other site qualities while ensuring adequate standards relating to public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare both in the use and occupancy of Buildings and facilities in planned groups. §15-2. Applicability. Minimum site size for PUDs shall be as provided in Table 15-1. Table 15-1: Minimum Size of Planned Unit Developments R-1, R-2, R-3 & R-4 Districts 10 ac BN, BT, BA, ED, IND Districts 10 ac BG, ICW-N & ICW-S Districts 3 ac BT-1N district None Single-family PUDs in Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay District 2 ac Non-residential Districts in Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay District 10 ac  A. Applicability within Overlay Districts. Subject to the approval of the Council after a review and report by the Commission and after a public hearing, PUDs are a permitted use in any district except any district located partially or entirely within the Beach Area Overlay, Walking Area Overlay or Lagoon Pass Overlay District. B. Applicability within the BT-1N District. PUDs may encompass multiple tracts of land provided all Parcels are contiguous for at least fifty (50) ft, or the only separation is a body of water that measures less than 200 ft between the closest property corners of the separated tracts. However, all the Parcels joined in a PUD application shall be under the same ownership at the time of application or said approval shall be conditioned upon the presentation to and acceptance by the City of a legal instrument demonstrating unified control of all properties included in the PUD. §15-3. Method. For Planned Unit Developments, the existing zoning classification shall be retained or may be changed to another zoning classification concurrently with approval of a PUD Master Plan. The PUD, then, serves as an overlay to the base zoning classification, in which modifications to the use, intensity and design regulations of the base zoning district may be considered as a part of the PUD Master Plan approval, to the extent permitted in this Article. PUD developments may extend across multiple zoning districts or, if the concerned property includes only one zoning designation, it may be divided into multiple zoning districts, which may be approved concurrently with the PUD Master Plan. In any case, the uses and zoning designations requested shall only be approved if found to be consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan and Land Use Plan component. Development standards, including but not limited to yards and setbacks, building design criteria, parking and loading requirements, trip generation factors, landscaping and buffer requirements, and thoroughfare standards, may be modified by one of the following methods, subject to the limitations of and upon review of the criteria outlined in §15-4 Use, Intensity and Design: A. with approval of a PUD Master Plan or amendment thereto; B. with approval of preliminary subdivision/Site Plans by the Commission. C. by phase in accordance with §15-6 Review and Approval Procedures and/or Article 5 of the Subdivision Regulations. §15-4. Use, Intensity, and Design. The following criteria will be considered in reviewing a PUD plan: A. Uses. The uses permitted in a PUD shall be those uses permitted in the base zoning district(s), except to the extent modified by the PUD subject to conformity with the City’s Land Use Plan. Uses that normally require approval as Conditional Uses, within the base zoning district(s), may be approved concurrently with the PUD Master Plan. When not approved at the time of Master Plan approval, such uses shall be subject to the normal procedures for Conditional Uses or an amendment to the PUD. Mixing of uses in PUDs is encouraged and therefore PUDs, which incorporate multiple uses and zoning districts are appropriate. The following are guidelines against which PUD applications shall be reviewed, as appropriate to the uses permitted and the size of the PUD:  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 15-2 1. PUDs should include, at a minimum, housing, recreational amenities, community facilities and Open Spaces. Large PUDs should incorporate workplaces, shops and Restaurants that are accessible internally and externally. Availability of jobs, shops, dining and recreational activities within walking distance can reduce traffic within the development, support community interaction and add to the development’s vitality. 2. Activity centers are the primary locations for integrating Non-residential and Mixed-use development into PUDs. In addition, activity centers may include Multiple-family developments, which can be incorporated into Mixed-use Buildings, and be surrounded by higher Density Single-family housing. Where justified by the number of homes to be included, the development may be asked to donate or reserve land for a school, fire station, or other community facilities. 3. For large PUDs with a mix of uses, uses placed at the periphery of the development should be compatible with, if not the same as, existing or planned uses in Adjacent areas of the community. 4. Uses should be laid out within a PUD so that “like faces like” across Thoroughfares. For example, Mixed-use or non-residential development on one side of a street should face similar uses on the other side of the street; residential uses should face residential uses of similar density; etc. Exceptions may be appropriate when the associated Thoroughfare is of higher classification (i.e. Arterial or Collector). B. Intensity and Density. Intensity and Density of uses permitted within a PUD are based on the area and dimensional regulations of the base zoning classification. Where the base zoning classification permitted specified Density increases or Building Heights, such increases shall generally be available within that portion of the PUD. However, such increases may be limited in certain base zoning classifications, as follows: 1. Approval of a PUD development within the BG, BT- 1N, ICW-N, or ICW-S districts shall result in no net increase in the Building Height, Gross Floor Area (GFA), or residential Density otherwise permitted by the regulations of the applicable zoning district that are in effect at the time of such approval. 2. For all other districts, no increase in density shall be considered in a request for a PUD unless specifically authorized by the base zoning district. 3. Refer to §15-5 for special provisions for PUDS in the Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay District. C. Center-Oriented. 1. PUDs larger than twenty-five (25) acres should be designed as one or more neighborhoods arranged around an activity center(s) such as a “village center” or “neighborhood center” that is designed as a functional and visual focus point within the development. These centers will generally include higher-Density residential uses, a park/commons, and a community facility (recreational facilities, churches, libraries, schools, Day Care Centers, etc.) at a minimum and may include other uses. 2. For smaller developments, orientation around an existing, Adjacent activity center may be acceptable. This is achieved when the majority of the PUD site is located within one-quarter (1/4) mile of an activity center designated in the Gulf Shores Land Use Plan, as amended. D. Integrating PUDs into the Community. PUDs should not be designed as enclaves isolated from surrounding neighborhoods and activity centers, but should be designed integrally to the larger community. 1. PUDs should not be gated. 2. Development along the perimeter of the PUD site should front on existing Abutting roads. Only when the external road is a high speed Arterial or when another functional reason exists that discourages frontage development, should Lots be allowed to “back up” to an Abutting Thoroughfare. Single-family and Duplex dwellings are not permitted to front on Arterial Thoroughfares. E. Housing Diversity. 1. PUDs should include a range of housing choices to serve the needs and desires of different market segments, for example, affordable housing and senior housing. 2. Where appropriate given the applicable zoning and land use planning for the location, a variety of housing types should be provided in addition to conventional Single-family detached homes. Other residential types that should be considered are: Accessory Dwellings on Single-family Lots, Cottage Subdivisions (small Lots which front on a common green), Townhouses, live-work Buildings, lofts, and “urban” Multiple-family Buildings (within or Adjacent to Mixed-use or Non- residential areas). 3. The arrangement and design of the residential portions of a PUD shall be considered with regard to providing an appropriate balance between visual interaction with the street and privacy for residents. For example, front porches establish visual interaction while also maintaining a physical transition between   15-3 Article 15: Planned Unit Development the more public nature of the street and sidewalk and the more private nature of the dwelling. F. Improvement Standards. A PUD shall conform with the Subdivision Regulations and this Ordinance, except where variations are approved by the Council, and with all other applicable ordinances in respect to the design, construction and guarantee of completion and maintenance of all required physical Improvements including but not limited to Thoroughfares, drainage, water supply and sewage collection. The following design criteria shall be considered by the Council with regard to any modification or waiver to the general requirements of this Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations. 1. Accommodations for Walking and Bicycling. a. The following components should be included to provide “walkability”: small Block sizes; sidewalks and trails; Complete Street environments; and a variety of destinations (neighborhoods, business areas, parks and Open Spaces) within a five-minute walking distance (or ¼ mile radius) of every home. b. At a minimum, an activity center or neighborhood park should be within one-quarter (¼) mile of every home (as measured along connecting sidewalks, not in a straight line), although homes in low-Density residential areas may be excluded. c. Bike lanes should be considered for inclusion on Arterials and Collectors. To this extent, driveway access and on-street parking along higher classification Thoroughfares may be restricted, if in conflict, with provision of suitable walking and bicycling facilities. 2. Connectivity. The street network should be designed with many internal and external connections to provide route options for motorists and to ensure best access for emergency services. a. Internal Connectivity. The internal street network should be designed to disperse internal traffic evenly throughout the neighborhood(s) rather than funneling most traffic onto only a few major Thoroughfares within the development. (1) Cul-de-sacs should be avoided wherever possible. Where it is necessary to terminate the internal street network, circles and closes (loops) should be used rather than cul-de- sacs. Close or Loop Street (2) If a Cul-de-sac is used, its diameter should be increased to accommodate a landscaped open space at its center, no less than 20 ft in any dimension, and a pedestrian and/or bicycle path should be provided at the head of the cul-de-sac which provides access to Adjacent Blocks, neighborhoods, open spaces, or pedestrian/bicycle ways. These connections should be in an easement of at least ten (10) ft in width. b. External Connectivity. The internal street network should include multiple access points to the surrounding street network to avoid or minimize traffic congestion at entrances/exits to the development. This is also advantageous for emergency access. (1) Where Adjacent to vacant, developable land, stub streets should be provided for future external connections. (2) Where Adjacent to existing stub streets, the PUD shall incorporate and connect the existing stub street into the planned street network. (3) Where located Adjacent to an existing or proposed transit line, the development should incorporate access to the existing or proposed service, including a new stop where applicable. (4) Trails, greenways and similar paths shown on the City Land Use Plan and/or Master Sidewalk and Bikeway Plan shall be incorporated into a PUD Master Plan where it passes through the PUD, or if adjacent to the PUD, connections to such paths should be provided. 3. Complete Streets. Internal streets should be designed to be safe and attractive and to accommodate automobiles, pedestrians and bicyclists, and the handicapped in accord with the street design standards in the Subdivision Regulations and as described below:  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 15-4 a. Lot Frontage and Access. (1) Lots should front on and may have access along most Thoroughfares within a PUD. However, where higher classification thoroughfares (Collectors or Arterials) are called for, either by the PUD or by the City’s Master Street Plan, specific planning and design treatments may be necessary to provide the desired function of the proposed Thoroughfare (i.e. capacity) while balancing said vehicular function with appropriate design speeds and accommodation of walking and bicycling facilities. Though properties are generally permitted to front on Collectors, vehicular access may be required by Local Streets or Alleys. (2) Double-frontage lots and single-tiered blocks should be avoided, although such conditions may be acceptable along higher classification Thoroughfares, but only on a case-by-case basis. b. Narrow lanes. Vehicular lanes should be narrow to calm traffic while including adequate width for access by emergency vehicles. Vehicular lanes should be eleven (11) ft in width for most local streets and other Thoroughfares where a speed limit of twenty-five (25) miles per hour is intended. c. On-street Parking. (1) Local streets serving activity centers and high-Density residential areas should include On-street Parking on both sides. (2) On-street Parking on one side of the road should be included in medium-Density residential areas, at a minimum. (3) Local streets serving low-Density residential areas should only include On-street Parking on one side at a maximum. (4) Higher speed roads with little or no fronting development are not appropriate for On- street Parking. d. Planting Strips. Planting Strips should be provided along the edges of the roadway for Landscaping purposes and should be five (5) ft in width at a minimum. In activity centers, these Planting Strips will be Hardscaped and act as an extension of the sidewalk, while including regularly spaced tree wells and other landscape areas. In residential areas, Planting Strips will be grassed and include regularly spaced Street Trees. In low Density residential areas, Planting Strips are replaced by vegetated swales or by lawn area. e. Street Trees. Street Trees are placed within the Planting Strip at the edge of the roadway to provide shade and enclosure to ensure a properly scaled environment. In higher Density areas, Street Trees should be uniformly placed within the street environment; while in lower Density areas, tree types and placement may be more varied to accentuate the more natural characteristics of such neighborhoods. f. Sidewalks. (1) Residential sidewalks should be wide enough (five (5) ft at a minimum) to allow two pedestrians to pass one another or for two pedestrians to walk side-by-side comfortably. Sidewalks should be provided on both sides of the street in medium and high density residential areas. Low Density residential areas may not require sidewalks but should be connected, at a minimum, to activity centers by trails or paths. (2) In activity centers, sidewalks should be eight (8) ft wide at a minimum plus the Planting Strip. Sidewalks should be located on both sides of the street. (3) All development areas, including recreational open space, within a PUD should be connected to activity centers (whether internal or not) either by sidewalks or by off- road trails, greenways or other paths. g. Bicycle Facilities. Collectors and Arterials within or along the perimeter of a PUD should accommodate on-street Bike Lanes or off-road Multi-Purpose Trails. On-street facilities are more appropriate in non-residential, mixed-use and dense residential areas, while off-road facilities are more appropriate in low density residential areas. Designated bike lanes are generally not necessary on Local Streets. h. Curbs and Drainage. In activity centers and medium and high-Density residential areas, curb and gutter is required to capture runoff and to direct drainage into storm sewers. In lower Density residential neighborhoods, valley curbs or vegetated swales are sufficient. In no case shall a valley curb be placed within five (5) ft of a sidewalk. i. Lighting and Utilities. Street lighting should be attractively designed and should provide lighting for vehicular traffic and lower-scaled lighting for pedestrians. There shall be no overhead utility   15-5 Article 15: Planned Unit Development lines along any Street Frontage. All utilities shall be placed underground. j. Frontage conditions. Streets should be visually enclosed by the Buildings alongside them. However, where Buildings can not be used to enclose a street, such as in the instance of open spaces and parking lots, low walls, trees and Shrubs should be included to define the edge of the public street environment from the private space or open space bordering it. (1) Parking lots may be permitted to abut rights- of-way only in activity centers and only when designed as described herein. (2) Off-street Parking in residential areas shall not be permitted forward of the Building Line with the exception of Driveways which shall not be wider than twelve (12) ft at the ROW Line and for a depth of at least twenty (20) ft. Driveways wider than twelve (12) ft should be located to the side or rear of the Dwelling and never forward of the Front Building Line. (3) Enclosed garages of detached Single-family Dwellings should be set back at least five (5) ft behind the Front Building Line. Enclosed garages of attached Single-family Dwellings should only be located at the rear of the Dwelling, accessed from an Alley or similar joint access. G. Screening and Buffers. Screening for individual uses and Structures shall be consistent with the requirements of §12-2 Screening. Buffering of uses along the perimeter of a PUD shall be consistent with §12-3 Buffers. Buffers between uses within the interior of a PUD may be waived or modified by the approving authority during Master Plan approval. §15-5. Special Provisions for PUDs in the Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay District. In addition to the other requirements of this Article, the following criteria shall further guide the consideration of PUDs within the Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay District. A. Multiple-family, Mixed-use PUDs. 1. A Mixed-use, Multiple-family, or commercial PUD must have a minimum of ten (10) or more contiguous acres that are not separated by Fort Morgan Road. 2. PUDs within the BT Districts may increase their Density by a maximum otherwise allowed by the base zoning district; and may increase their maximum height by up to five (5) Habitable Stories above the maximum otherwise allowed by the base district. 3. PUDs within the BN District will not receive increases in Density. 4. Subject to the discretion of the Council, all or a portion of the Commercial Uses may be required to be located Adjacent to Ft. Morgan Road. 5. Most, if not all, required parking is to be located under the Building. 6. The maximum Impervious Surface area should be thirty-five (35) percent. 7. No Density transfers shall be permitted across Fort Morgan Road. This includes transfers toward the waterfront or away from the waterfront. B. Single-family PUDs. 1. A Single Family PUD must have a minimum of two (2) or more contiguous acres that are not separated by any ROW. 2. Must be zoned R-1 or R-2. 3. Condominium PUDs may request common Driveways for access and non-traditional paving surfaces so long as an all-weather surface is provided. Post-storm clean-up issues and impacts on endangered species will be considered in reviewing alternative paving requests. 4. PUDs will not increase Density but should attempt to create larger and more significant Open Spaces through the Conservation Subdivision approach (§11- 10). 5. PUDs should provide exceptional amenities and common areas Adjacent to water bodies and other natural areas. C. Permitted Uses. The uses permitted shall be those uses permitted by the base zoning district, except as modified through Master Plan approval, and as limited by §15-5D Prohibited Uses. D. Prohibited Uses. Outdoor Storage, heavy commercial, industry, adult entertainment, motion picture theaters, Building materials, pawn shops, auto body shops, auto sales, parts and services, car washes, and Junkyards. §15-6. Review and Approval Procedures. A. Submission Requirements; PUD Master Plan. To provide an expedited method for processing a PUD Master Plan all procedures for approval or disapproval of a Master Plan, and the continuing administration thereof, shall be subject to following provisions: 1. An application for a Master Plan shall be filed by or on behalf of the landowner with the Zoning Official. The purpose of the Master Plan is to provide the City with information in respect to the type, character, scale and intensity of development as well as the time  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 15-6 phasing of the proposed PUD for the City to evaluate the impact of the development upon the City. 2. The application for Master Plan approval shall include a written statement describing fully the character and intended use of the PUD and setting forth the reasons why the PUD would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the City's statement of purposes on PUD. 3. The applicant shall provide a written narrative specifically calling out all zoning relaxations being requested through the PUD. These may include clustering of units, reduced Lot size and Setbacks, use considerations, Building Height Variances, design considerations, etc., and shall also identify the private and public benefits of the PUD, including but not limited to: a. Public Benefits: Traffic and utility Improvements, regional and local bicycle/pedestrian Improvements, Buffering from Adjacent sites, aesthetic Improvements, dedication of school or park sites, enhancement of property values, sign enhancements, preservation of natural areas and views, creating public access to water or other popular sites. b. Private Benefits: Amenities for site users, Open Space and recreation, clustering of uses, creation of neighborhoods, Landscaping, traffic circulation, multi-modal circulation (including bicycle and pedestrian elements), private space for units, parking, tree preservation, preserving unique views and natural areas in common areas for the use and enjoyment of all residents/guests (such as water fronts), enhanced architecture and site layout. 4. The PUD Master Plan shall consist of a site plan, preliminary landscape plan, building elevations, design guidelines, residential lot layout, open space plan, bicycle/pedestrian circulation plan, and other plans applicable to the project. The use and development of the property in a PUD shall substantially conform to the development plan approved by the Council as an exhibit to the Ordinance for approval of the PUD. 5. Applications shall be accompanied by additional narratives, drawings, and other information as required by the CDD. B. Review Procedure. An application for a Master Plan shall be filed with the Zoning Official. Upon receipt of said application, the Zoning Official shall review said application to determine its appropriateness and completeness and accept or reject the application. Upon acceptance of a completed application, a PUD proposal shall be reviewed and approved as required for rezoning requests in Article 3, unless modified herein. During the review process, the City may retain consultants to assist in the review. The cost of retaining said consultants shall be borne by the applicant. C. The Findings. 1. The Council shall, by ordinance, either (1) grant approval of the Master Plan as submitted, (2) grant approval subject to specified conditions not included in the Master Plan as submitted, or (3) deny approval to the plan. a. In the event approval is granted, the Council shall, as part of its ordinance, specify the drawings, specifications and form of performance and maintenance bonds that shall accompany an application for final approval. b. In the event approval is granted subject to conditions, the applicant shall within forty-five (45) days after receiving a copy of the written resolution of the Council notify the Council in writing of his acceptance or refusal of all said conditions. c. In the event that applicant refuses to accept all said conditions or fails to reply within forty-five (45) days, the Council shall be deemed to have denied approval of the plan. 2. The grant or denial of approval by Ordinance shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact related to the specific proposal, including a finding that the public and private benefits generated from the PUD, as proposed, equal or exceed the benefit granted to the applicant through any modifications or waivers of this Ordinance, and shall set forth the reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for denials, and said Ordinance shall specify in what respects the plan would not be in the public interest, including but limited to findings of fact and conclusions of the following: a. In what respect the plan is or is not consistent with the statement of purpose for PUDs; b. The extents to which the PUD is consistent with and achieves goals of the Comprehensive Plan. c. The extent to which the plan departs from zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property. d. The purpose, location and amount of the Common Open Space in the PUD, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the Common Open Space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and   15-7 Article 15: Planned Unit Development purpose of the Common Open Space is related to the proposed Density and type of development. e. The physical design of the plan and the manner in which said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic and parking and further the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment. f. The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed PUD to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established. g. In the case of a plan which proposes development over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the interest of the public and of the residents and owners of the PUD in the integrity of the plan. 3. In granting approval, the Council may apply any conditions deemed necessary to protect Adjacent property, the public interest or to ensure that the public/private benefits generated by the application are adequately balanced against the benefits granted to the applicant. To this end, the Council may attach conditions to an approval including, but not limited to, the following: a. On-site improvements and off-site improvements within public ROWs or off-road trails, greenways or paths; b. Development standards; c. Design guidelines; d. Conditions on uses; e. Dedication of land for public purposes or reservation of land for future public acquisition; f. Granting of utility easements; g. Granting of easements for public trails and open spaces; and h. Requirements for establishment of a homeowners’ or property owners’ associations or other mechanism to assure continued maintenance of commonly owned land and facilities. D. Status of Plan after Master Plan Approval. Within seven (7) days after the adoption of the ordinance provided for in §15-6C, a copy of the ordinance shall be mailed to the applicant. Where approval of a Master Plan has been granted, the same shall be noted on the Official Zoning Map. A Master Plan, upon approval, as provided herein, is defined as running with the land subject to the limitations specified in Paragraphs G and H following; provided, however, that an applicant may apply for an amendment to said Master Plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in §15-6H. Approval of a Master Plan shall not authorize a plat of the PUD for recording purposes or Site Plan approval, or authorize development or the issuance of any Building Permits. A Master Plan, which has been given approval as submitted or with conditions (and provided that the applicant has not defaulted nor violated any such conditions ), shall not be modified, revoked or otherwise impaired by action of the City pending an application for plat approval, without the consent of the applicant, provided an application for plat or Site Plan approval (whichever is applicable) is filed or, in the case of development over a period of years, provided applications are filed within the periods of time specified in the ordinance granting approval of the Master Plan. Approval of a Master Plan with or without special conditions shall represent the zoning of that area contained within the plan and shall apply to the land in a manner consistent with zoning unaffected by the sale or transfer of ownership of the land. Upon approval, the applicant shall be released to apply for plat or Site Plan approval (whichever is applicable) in accord with the Subdivision Regulations and/or §3-3 Site Plan Review of this Ordinance. The processing of a Site Plan or subdivision plat commensurate with the PUD Master Plan is acceptable so long as the PUD is adopted prior to the other approvals or the subdivision/Site Plan approvals are conditioned on the PUD being approved by the Council. In the case of a subdivision plat it shall not be signed by the City or recorded unless and until said PUD is approved. If said PUD is not approved within sixty (60) days of the subdivision or Site Plan approval they shall become null and void. E. Multiple Phase PUDS. The Master Plan shall include a Phasing Schedule for any PUD to be developed in multiple phases, which describes when major Thoroughfares, open and recreational spaces, and similar amenities or community facilities will be dedicated, reserved or constructed. The Phasing Schedule shall include the timing of providing all Improvements as proffered. The Phasing Schedule shall also consider the need for future amendments, where necessary or desirable. The Zoning Official may approve minor revisions to the Phasing Schedule where it can be shown to be in the best interest of the PUD and the City. F. Abandonment After Approval. In the event that a plan or a section thereof is approved by the Council, and thereafter the applicant abandons said plan or the section thereof and so notifies the Council in writing, or, in the event  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 15-8 the applicant fails to commence construction of the PUD, excluding site grading, within five (5) years of Master Plan approval, such approval shall terminate and be deemed null and void, in which case the property shall revert to the base zoning classification. The Council shall have the authority to extend this period for no more than one (1) year and may only grant such an extension one (1) time for an approved Master Plan. G. Inactive PUDs. 1. Any approved PUD, or any phase of an approved PUD shall be classified inactive if: a. Five (5) years following the date of approval by the Council, there is no valid Building Permit in effect and substantial construction other than site grading has not begun b. Less than sixty (60) percent of the floor area has been constructed, and five (5) years have expired since the most recent newly constructed Building received a Certificate of Occupancy; there is no valid Building Permit in effect, and substantial construction to resume construction activity other than site grading has not begun 2. Exception for PUDs with phasing schedules exceeding five (5) years: If the developer provides evidence, and the Zoning Official makes findings, that a multi-phase PUD has adhered to the approved development schedule, and that construction of Buildings and uses has been uninterrupted, then the failure to meet the construction targets of Items 1a and 1b above on one or more individual phases shall not cause said phases to be classified inactive. For purposes of this Subsection, construction is uninterrupted when there is no interval of twelve (12) or more months when a Certificate of Occupancy has not been issued for a newly constructed Building somewhere in the PUD, without regard to phase lines. 3. No Land Disturbing Activity Permit nor Building Permit for new Building construction shall be issued for an inactive PUD, or for any inactive phase(s) thereof, until the PUD is reviewed by the Commission and the Council takes final action as outlined below. 4. Review of an inactive PUD, or any inactive phase(s) thereof, may be performed by the Commission, on its own initiative; upon referral by City Staff; or upon request of the property owner(s) or agent. In such case, the Commission, and any subsequent action by the Council, shall follow the same procedures for meetings and public notice as provided in §3-6 Zoning Amendments except as modified below. 5. Within ninety (90) days, the Commission shall provide recommendations to the Council which reflects its findings on the following: a. Whether the PUD or phase(s) thereof under review has become inactive, according to this Subsection b. The appropriateness of the continued implementation of the PUD or phase(s) thereof as adopted, based on current conditions and circumstances, including the appropriate base zoning district necessary to implement the PUD as it exists c. Any recommendation to amend the PUD Master Plan or individual phase(s) thereof to properly reflect existing conditions and circumstances, and the appropriate base zoning classification(s) should the zoning provisions of the Master Plan be removed, in whole or in part, from the area of the inactive PUD or the area of any inactive phase(s). 6. The Council shall take final action to re-authorize the existing PUD Master Plan, amend the PUD Master Plan (if requested or agreed to by the owner(s) or agent), or deem the PUD Master Plan null and void, in which case the property shall revert to the base zoning classification. H. Amendments. Amendments to the approved Master Plan may be made if shown to be in the best interests of the PUD and the City as follows: 1. The Zoning Official may approve minor revisions to the Master Plan, including but not limited to: a. Adjustments to the boundaries of Open Space areas as designated on the Master Plan, provided that the approved overall percentage in an area is not altered and the utility of Open Space areas is not materially changed b. Roadway plan adjustments, which occur within areas of like uses and do not significantly alter the overall transportation system c. Minor phasing schedule changes, which shall not exceed a change of ten (10) percent of the approved non-residential GFA or approved number of dwelling units from one phase to another d. Density shifts between residential areas, which involve no more than a five (5) percent Density increase within the subject phase, provided that the approved Density for the entire Master Plan is not increased. 15-9 Article 15: Planned Unit Development 2. Major amendments to the Master Plan may be made only through the rezoning process in §3-6 and include but are not limited to: a. An increase in area of any of the approved land uses shown on the approved Master Plan. b. A change that would increase the land use intensity or Density within any phase of the Master Plan without a corresponding decrease in some other phase. c. A shift of development Density that would adversely impact on-site or off-site transportation systems. d. Major phasing schedule changes, which exceed a change of ten (10) percent of the approved non-residential GFA or approved number of dwelling units from one phase to another e. Any adjustment not deemed a minor amendment by the Zoning Official 3. Amendments to an approved Master Plan shall not modify the PUD Abandonment and Inactivity requirements of §15-6F and §15-6G above unless specifically requested and approved by the reviewing authority. I. Application for Plat or Site Plan Approval. An application for plat or Site Plan approval may be for all the land included in the plan, or to the extent set forth in the Master Plan approval, for a section thereof. The application shall include such drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, conditions and forms of performance and maintenance bonds as set forth by ordinance of the Council at the time of approval of the Master Plan and as required by the Subdivision Regulations or §3-3 Site Plan Review in this Ordinance, whichever is applicable. J. Requirements. Applications for plat or Site Plan approval of a PUD or portion thereof shall be accompanied by the materials required by the CDD for PUD Plat and Site Plan Approvals, any additional requirements of the Subdivision Regulations or §3-3 Site Plan Review, as applicable, and the following: 1. Agreements, provisions, declarations or covenants which govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the PUD and any of its common open areas and other amenities. 2. The final plan shall be accompanied by a written agreement, in a form acceptable to the City's legal counsel, on behalf of the owner, or the owner's successors and assigns as follows: a. that the proposed development, as shown on the plans and as set forth in specifications, will be completed in every detail within such time period as may be agreed upon by the Council b. that all land Improvements intended for the common use of all residents, including drives, walks, parking areas, recreational facilities and equipment and all landscaped or other Common Open Space will be maintained in perpetuity, including such servicing as may be required for the use of such land Improvements c. that no future changes in the development shall be made which would encroach upon the land used to comply with the requirements of this article as to Density, Open Space, Yards, courts, vehicular access, automobile parking, Building Coverage or other outdoor requirements d. that all easements for private drives, utility lines and similar purposes shall be open at all times for access by publicly employed personnel and equipment for police and fire protection, for inspection of utility systems and for any other public purpose. K. Compliance with Master Plan Required for Plat Approval. If the Zoning Official finds that said application for plat or Site Plan approval is in substantial compliance with the Master Plan, the application shall proceed in accord with the procedures set forth in the Subdivision Regulations or §3-3 Site Plan Review, as applicable. A plan submitted for plat or Site Plan approval of a portion of an Master Plan shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the approved Master Plan provided any modification by the applicant does not change the Density, Open Space or other provisions of the total PUD and any portion thereof does not: 1. vary the proposed residential Density or intensity of use by more than five ( 5) percent; 2. involve a reduction of the area set aside for Common Open Space nor the substantial relocation of such area; 3. increase by more than ten (10) percent the floor area proposed for Non-residential use; nor 4. increase by more than five (5) percent the total ground areas covered by Buildings nor involve a substantial change in the height of Buildings. L. Status of Plan after Plat or Site Plan Approval. Where approval of a Plat or Site plan has been granted, said approvals shall remain active in accordance with the timelines established in the Subdivision Regulations or in §3-3 Site Plan Review of this Ordinance. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 15-10  This page intentionally left blank. 16-1 Article 16: Site Plan Review  ARTICLE 16: SITE PLAN REVIEW §16-1. Site Plan Review. Site Plan Review by the Commission or administrative Site Plan Review by the Community Development Department (CDD) shall be required in accordance with §3-3 Site Plan Review. The following standards shall be used in reviewing any Site Plan. At the time of alterations or enlargement of a nonconforming Structure(s) or site, the entire Structure(s) and site shall be made to conform with the requirements of this Article. A. Traffic Access Criteria. 1. All proposed access ways are adequate, but not excessive in number; adequate in Grade, width, alignment and visibility; and not located too near street corners or adjacent driveways (in accord with City Access Standards), places of public assembly and other similar considerations. 2. Driveways, unless they provide through access to an Abutting street, shall not be aligned to an intersection, whether signalized or not. B. Circulation and Parking Criteria. 1. There shall be adequate, safe and convenient arrangement of Thoroughfares, Driveways, Off-street Parking, Loading space and pedestrian circulation facilities. To this end, pedestrian walkways shall be provided within all developments and shall be arranged in a manner that allows for safe and efficient pedestrian travel both in and around the site, separating pedestrian use areas from parking lots, Loading areas, Driveways, and roadways. 2. Thoroughfares, pedestrian walks and Open Space shall be designed as integral parts of the overall site design. They shall be properly related to existing and proposed Buildings and appropriately landscaped. a. To properly accommodate pedestrian circulation, logical connections shall be provided between on-site and off-site walkways. b. In the event that off-site walkways are not provided but where the subject site is situated along an identified segment of the Master Bikeway and Sidewalk Plan for the City, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide for these off-site walkways and such provision shall become an integral part of the overall site development plan. 3. Materials and design of paving, lighting fixtures, retaining walls, fences, curbs, benches, and signs shall be of good appearance, easily maintained and appropriate to their function. 4. Parking facilities shall be designed with careful regard to orderly arrangement, landscaping, drainage, ease of access, adequacy and shall be developed as an integral part of an overall site design. a. In other than the BA and Industrial Districts, Off- street Parking should be located to the rear or side of Buildings, rather than in front of them. However, it is understood that this may not be practicable in all cases, such as previously subdivided or developed lands b. In the BA District, Off-street Parking in front of Buildings should be limited to a depth (from the Front Lot Line to the Front Building Line) of one double-loaded parking bay, or about sixty (60) to seventy (70) ft. However, a deeper parking area is acceptable when the access way separating the parking area from the main Building entrance is designed as a “Complete Street” with sidewalks on each side, on-street parking (where possible), street trees, and marked pedestrian crossings. C. Design and Arrangement of Buildings. 1. Adequate provision shall be made for light, air, access and privacy in the arrangement of Buildings to each other. Each living space shall have sufficient exterior exposures. 2. All Buildings in the layout and design shall be an integral part of the development and have convenient access to and from Adjacent uses. 3. Individual Buildings shall be related to each other in design, massing, materials, placement and connections to provide a visually and physically integrated development. 4. The design of Buildings and the parking facilities shall take advantage of the natural features and topography of the project site, where appropriate. 5. All Building walls shall be oriented to ensure adequate light and air exposures to the rooms within. 6. All Buildings shall be arranged so as to avoid undue exposure to concentrated Loading or parking facilities wherever possible and shall be oriented to preserve visual and audible privacy between Adjacent Buildings. 7. All Buildings shall be arranged to be accessible to emergency vehicles. D. Storm Drainage. The Site Plan must provide for the adequate disposal of storm water runoff in a manner that will not contribute to flooding or erosion of Adjacent properties or streets and will not carry pollutants onto the beaches. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 16-2  E. Conformity with Provisions of Codes and Ordinances. All development shown on the Site Plan must conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, the Subdivision Regulations, the Building Code, and other applicable ordinances. F. Architectural Restrictions. The following architectural standards shall apply throughout the City or as otherwise described herein. Upon a showing of special need, critical function, or exceptional design, alternative materials may be approved through the Site Plan approval process. 1. Novelty Architecture.

However, in cases where Buildings are permitted to abut another Building along a Side Lot Line, Building walls erected at the Side Lot Line may have more modest design treatments. 6. Building disposition. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 18, 24, and 25. a. To the extent permitted within the district, Non- residential and Mixed-use Buildings should be     16-3 Article 16: Site Plan Review  located at the back of the public sidewalk aligned lengthwise along the primary frontage. b. Principal Buildings shall have their primary entrances along a public Thoroughfare or public pedestrian way, such as a boardwalk. 7. Vertical Massing and Modulation. Multi-storied Buildings shall incorporate architectural Modulation of the elevation and Building profile. Such Buildings should have a “base”, “middle”, and “cap” differentiated through changes in material and color, amount and proportion of Fenestration, belt courses and projecting cornices. Additional Modulation shall be achieved through architectural features such as arcades, colonnades, Awnings, canopies and balconies, and through multiple offsets in vertical planes such that a number of upper floors are smaller than floors below. Irregular roof profiles are also encouraged. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 25 and 31. a. The base is that portion of the Façade enclosing the lowest floor(s) of the Building and, when containing Non-residential uses, should provide an attractive storefront appearance with a minimum of fifty (50) percent Fenestration (including entrances). Finish materials should appear substantial, giving the impression of being thicker or heavier than that of upper floors. Shade and weather protection should be considered and may be provided through arcades, Awnings, or canopies. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 24, 26 and 27. Building with base, middle, and cap composition. b. The middle is that portion of the Façade between the base and the uppermost floor or cornice and should generally have vertically- proportioned windows although multiple windows within the same structural opening may have a horizontal proportion. c. The cap is that portion of the Façade enclosing the uppermost floor(s) of the Building (for Buildings with pitched roofs) or the uppermost floors and/or cornice (for flat roof Buildings). The cap should be accentuated through a change in masonry patterns, materials, colors, a horizontal band dividing the middle from the cap, or a combination of these. For flat roof Buildings, the cap should include a well-articulated cornice proportionate with the overall size of the Building (see also Item 7 Roofs following). 8. Horizontal Massing and Modulation. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 30. a. Building s set back from the street by an Off- street Parking area should incorporate Modulation of the Façade(s) and Massing. Modulation shall be achieved with changes in Building materials and projections and/or recesses and roof profiles every fifty (50) ft or less spacing projections and recesses should be a minimum of two (2) ft, measured in plan view. Modulation  b. Buildings built up to a public sidewalk, where permitted, should maintain a consistent edge along the sidewalk and have relatively shallow projections and recesses, although Modulation in upper floors is desirable as well as variety in Façade materials that accentuate the base, middle, and cap elements of the Façade. City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 16-4  Building with entrance(s) oriented to public sidewalk. 9. In the Walking Area Overlay District, the first level of Buildings above base flood elevation (BFE) facing Gulf Shores Pkwy., Beach Blvd., and 1st Ave. shall consist of retail and Commercial Uses directly accessible from sidewalks. No less than forty (40) percent of the Façades of such uses shall consist of clear glass. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 11, 14, 26, and 33. 10. Fenestration. For Buildings over five (5) Stories in height, maximum Fenestration and open balconies on upper floors are encouraged. Blank Walls, as defined in Article 4, may not constitute more than forty (40) percent of any Façade. Buildings with high percentage of Fenestration and balconies on upper floors 11. Parking Structures shall be reviewed for consistency with Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines 28 and 29. The Façades of Parking Structures shall either be lined with retail storefronts or finished with masonry Façades that repeat the expression of, (having similar materials, structural elements, and size and proportions of openings) the occupied Stories of the Façade. Parking Structures should be lined with habitable spaces. Retail and Service Uses are recommended at ground level along the street. In upper floors, Office or residential uses are encouraged. Where such liner uses are not practicable, the Parking Structure’s Façade should be finished with materials and details consistent with any occupied portions of the Building or neighboring Buildings. Openings in the Façade of the Parking Structure shall be filled with decorative panels or louvers that allow natural ventilation but screen the view of parked automobiles within. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 28 and 29. Parking deck with liner Building along street  12. Roofs. a. Pitched roofs are encouraged. Pitched roofs should be constructed with textured shingles of fiberglass composition, wood shingles, or standing seam metal or other materials approved by the Approving Authority. b. Flat roofs are acceptable but should incorporate distinctive cornice features or similar architectural articulation of the roof. The height and depth of such element should increase with the height of the Building. 13. The above provisions of this Subsection are intended to serve as a guide to prospective developers or builders and are not intended to be all-inclusive.

With respect to Condominiums or cooperatives, notices required by this section may be sent to each, the secretary and the president of the  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 17-8  Condominium or cooperative association, unless such offices are not filled in which event notice to the agent designated for the service of process will be sufficient for compliance with the notice requirements of this section. §17-5. Variances. A. Limitation of Variances. Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by Variance, nor shall a Variance be granted because of the presence of non-conformities in the zoning district or uses in an Adjacent zoning district. B. Requirements for Issuance of Variances. To authorize any Variance from the terms of this Ordinance, the BZA must hold a public hearing in accord with §17-2D Meetings Open to Public and shall find that all of the following conditions exist/apply: 1. That the granting of the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest; 2. That the literal enforcement of the Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, topography or other extraordinary or exceptional physical situation or physical condition unique to the specific piece of property in question; unnecessary hardship shall mean physical hardship relating to the property itself as distinguished from a hardship relating to convenience, financial considerations or caprice, and the hardship must not result from the applicant or property owner's own actions; 3. That granting the Variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, Buildings, or Structures in the same zoning district; 4. That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this Ordinance; 5. That the Variance granted is the minimum Variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, Building or Structure; 6. That granting the Variance shall not permit a use in a zoning district which prohibits that use; and, 7. That the granting of the Variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and that such Variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. C. Burden of Proof. The burden of proving to the BZA that the foregoing conditions have been met is upon the applicant. D. Conditions. In granting any Variance, the BZA may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the Variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. E. Effect of Variances. Variances, unless specifically conditioned by the BZA, shall run with the land. A variance granted by the Board shall lapse and be of no effect if, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of such action by the Board, no permit pursuant to such variance has been issued by the City. The Board may, for good cause shown, place specific conditions on the expiration and required action by the applicant in conjunction with its approval to grant the variance. In such cases and where conditions established by the BZA have not been met, the Variance shall become null and void and the application shall be reheard, with any new information or findings as appropriate, prior to approval. §17-6. Judicial Remedy by Circuit Court. Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision of the BZA, or by a decision of the City Attorney that the BZA has no jurisdiction, may apply to the Circuit Court for judicial relief within the time period as provided in Title 11-52-81, Code of Alabama, as amended. 18-1 Article 18: Sign Regulations  ARTICLE 18: SIGN REGULATIONS §18-1. Purpose. A. The purpose of these regulations is to provide minimum control of signs to promote the health, safety and general welfare; to avoid congestion on the public streets and roads; and to preserve property values: by preventing unsightly and detrimental development that would detract from the tourist resort appeal of the community and lead to economic decline and blight, by preventing signs from reaching such excessive size or numbers that they obscure one another to the detriment of all concerned and by securing certain fundamentals of design that would strengthen the community's economic base. §18-2. General Sign Regulations. A. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article, signs shall be permitted only as accessory or appurtenant to an existing or approved Principal Use or Structure on the same property. The following regulations apply generally to all signs and are in addition to the regulations established for each District or the regulations contained elsewhere in this Ordinance. B.

No sign, unless herein excepted, shall be erected, constructed, posted, painted, altered, maintained, or relocated until a permit has been issued by the Community Development Department (CDD) Before any permit has been issued, an application shall be filed together with such drawings and specifications as may be necessary to fully advise and acquaint the Zoning Official with the location, height, size, construction, materials, manner of illuminating, and securing or fastening, and number of signs applied for and the wording of the sign or advertisement to be carried on the sign. Information shall be provided for existing as well as proposed signs. Changing the copy on a bulletin board, poster board, display encasement, or marquee, including the substitution of non- commercial messages for existing commercial messages, shall not require a permit. C. Staff review. The Zoning Official shall review all sign permit applications for compliance with this Ordinance. Because signs are so nearly a part of the premises to which they are attached or pertain, the Zoning Official shall assure, through the review process, that signs are appropriately fit to, and are not incompatible with, their host premises. Only upon finding that all proposed signs are in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance shall the Zoning Official cause to be issued a sign permit upon payment of the appropriate fee. D. Fees. Each sign permit application shall be accompanied by payment of a permit fee, as established by resolution of the City Council. This fee shall defray the cost of processing sign permit applications, and shall be charged in addition to any building permit fee, electrical permit fee, or any other fee associated with the approval of a proposed or existing development. E. Time limitation, sign permit.

A Master Signage Plan (MSP) is designed to benefit the community in administering its sign regulations. The purpose of such a plan is twofold. (1) It provides a Master Plan for all signs on a Premises; and (2) It provides a Master Record of all signs on a Premises This provides the Zoning Official with information about existing signs on a site when considering a permit application for a new sign and also eliminates the need to recompute permitted Sign Area and numbers for a property every time a sign administration or enforcement question arises. By requiring planning and coordination of signs on a property, the streetscape will improve though strict and detailed substantive requirements are not imposed. It is, in a sense, a PUD for signs and imposes minimum area requirements so that it will only apply to large developments where a large number of signs will be present. It can be used as an incentive by rewarding developers who prepare and follow coordinated signage plans for the property. The provisions of the plan impose no maximum amounts of signage on the Premises as a whole and also provides for a common Detached Sign, which could be larger than is normally allowed. The standards for signage in the applicable zoning districts shall be used as a guideline during the approval process, but certain deviations may be made depending upon the intensity and scope of the development if it is determined by the Zoning Official that the deviations are in keeping with the intent of this Section. The intent of the MSP is to develop a creative approach to satisfying reasonable sign needs and not simply a means of requesting or receiving greater sign area or larger signs. B. Criteria for Consideration of a MSP. The provisions as  set forth in this section may be used in lieu of the provisions for signage in the BG, BA, IND, ICW, ATP and PUD Districts only when all of the following criteria apply: 1. The development area for which a MSP is filed shall be at least ten (10) acres. 2. The use for which a MSP is filed shall be characterized as either a campus, industrial park, office park, Amusement Park, shopping center, Mixed-use development, planned residential community, public or semi-public use, or a phase thereof. 3. The Premises has at least 200 ft of Lot Frontage along a public Thoroughfare. C. Sign Permits. No Sign Permit shall be issued for any signs within a proposed MSP-designated area or a phase thereof unless and until a MSP for the Premises has been submitted to the Zoning Official and approved as conforming with this section. D. MSP Submission Requirements. For any project or property wishing to take advantage of this section, the owner(s) shall submit to the Zoning Official an MSP application containing the following: 1. An accurate plot plan of the Premises at such a scale as the Zoning Official may reasonably require, showing: a. Location of Buildings, parking lots, Driveways and landscaped areas; b. An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and future  Zoning District s Sign Types Sign Area (Sq.Ft. or % of Bldg Façade) Sign Height Number of Signs/ Frontage Spacing Between Signs Regulations by Districts ICW Detached Sign 32 8’ 1 N/A 1.

Computation of the total Sign Area, the area of each individual sign, the height of signs, and an outline of the Building Façades for which signs will be mounted. This shall include all signs permitted for the applicable district and any additional signage area requested through the MSP. E. Master Signage Plan Review. A Master Signage Plan application may be submitted with any Site Plan, PUD plan, or other Official plan required by the City (excluding Building Permits, Land Disturbing Activity Permits, etc.) for the proposed development and shall be processed simultaneously with such other applications. For developments containing more than one phase, site or Premises, a MSP shall be required for each site or Premises upon development. F. Amendment. A Master Signage Plan may be amended by filing a new Master Signage Plan with the Council that conforms with all requirements of the ordinance then in effect. G. Binding Effect. After approval of a Master Signage Plan, no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this Ordinance. §18-4.

Unless the opinion of the City Attorney otherwise directs, the standards to be applied by the Zoning Official shall include the following: a. an award component equal to the depreciated value of the sign as reflected on the books and records of the owner as of the date of removal or, if not yet removed, as of the date of the  City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance 18-14  Notice to Cease and Desist provided the sign has been depreciated by the owner using generally accepted accounting principles, less the reasonable salvage value of the sign materials, if any; b. an award component equal to the present value of the net revenue realizable but unrealized by the owner during the remaining term of any lease or contract with respect to the sign (A) in effect on the date of removal or the date of the Notice to Cease and Desist, if removal has not been effected, and (B) entered into prior to the effective date of nonconformity, with the remaining term measured to the earliest date a party other than the owner could elect to terminate such lease or contract on a basis other than default by the owner; c. an award component equal to the reasonable cost to the owner of removal of the sign.

The Zoning Official shall transmit a copy of the City Clerk's written advice to the owner by first class mail as provided above. 4. The determination of the Zoning Official may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Any party aggrieved by the final judgment or decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment or by the decision of the City Attorney that an appropriate legal basis for a compensation claim has not been presented, may apply to the Circuit Court for judicial relief within the time period as provided in Section 11-52-81 of the Code of Alabama, as amended. 5. In the event of an appeal of the Official's determination by any party aggrieved, the operation of any Notice to Cease and Desist then in effect shall be and remain suspended until no appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment or to any court remains pending. Upon final determination of the award of compensation in the appeals process, the City Clerk shall advise the Zoning Official in writing within twenty-one (21) days after the date of final determination whether City agrees to pay the award of compensation as finally determined upon removal of the sign or the City requests that the Notice to Cease and Desist with respect to the sign be withdrawn until such time as the City gives written notice of its request for a new determination of the award of compensation. Upon receipt of such latter request, the Zoning Official shall withdraw the Notice to Cease and Desist and shall give the owner written notice of such withdrawal by first class mail as provided above. 19-1  ARTICLE 19: APPENDIX Zoning Ordinance Amendments 1.

Introduction Development Adoption PREFACE Internationally, code officials recognize the need for consistent and uniform zoning ordinances. The International Zoning Code®, in this 2012 edition, is designed to meet this need through model code regulations that safeguard the public health and safety in all communities, large and small. This comprehensive zoning code establishes minimum regulations for zoning ordinances. This 2012 edition is fully compatible with all of the International Codes® (I-Codes®) published by the International Code Council (ICC)®, including the international Building Code®, international Energy Conservation Code®, International Existing Building Code®, International Fire Code®, international Fuel Gas Code®, International Green Construction Code™ (to be available March 2012), international Mechanical Code®, ICC Performance Code®, International Plumbing Code®, International Private Sewage Disposal Code®, international Property Maintenance Code®, International Residential Code®, International Swimming Pool and Spa Code™ (to be available March 2012), and International Wildland-Urban interface Code®. The International Zoning Code provides many benefits, among which is the model code develop- ment process that offers an international forum for code officials and other interested parties to discuss performance and prescriptive code requirements. This forum provides an excellent arena to debate proposed revisions. This model code also encourages international consistency in the appli- cation of provisions. The first edition of the International Zoning Code (1998) was the culmination of an effort initiated in 1996 by a code development committee appointed by ICC and consisting of representatives of the three statutory members of the International Code Council at that time: Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) and Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI). The intent was to draft a comprehensive set of zoning regulations for jurisdictions that have a need for a zoning ordinance and desire that it be compatible with the model codes adopted by the jurisdiction. This 2012 edition presents the code as originally issued, with changes reflected through the previous 2009 edition. A new edition of the code is promulgated every three years. This code is founded on principles intended to establish provisions consistent with the scope of a zoning code that adequately protects public health, safety and welfare; provisions that do not unnecessarily increase construction costs; provisions that do not restrict the use of new materials, products or methods of construction; and provisions that do not give preferential treatment to par- ticular types or classes of materials, products or methods of construction. The International Zoning Code is available for adoption and use by jurisdictions internationally. Its use within a governmental jurisdiction is intended to be accomplished through adoption by refer- ence in accordance with proceedings establishing the jurisdiction’s laws. At the time of adoption, jurisdictions should insert the appropriate information in provisions requiring specific local informa- tion, such as the name of the adopting jurisdiction. These locations are shown in bracketed words in small capital letters in the code and in the sample ordinance. The sample adoption ordinance on page xi addresses several key elements of a code adoption ordinance, including the information required for insertion into the code text. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” iii Maintenance The International Zoning Code is kept up to date through the review of proposed changes submitted by code enforcing officials, industry representatives, design professionals and other interested par- ties. Proposed changes are carefully considered through an open code development process in which all interested and affected parties may participate. The contents of this work are subject to change both through the Code Development Cycles and the governmental body that enacts the code into law. For more information regarding the code development process, contact the Codes and Standards Development Department of the Interna- tional Code Council. While the development procedure of the international Zoning Code assures the highest degree of care, ICC, its members and those participating in the development of this code do not accept any liability resulting from compliance or noncompliance with the provisions because the ICC does not have the power or authority to police or enforce compliance with the contents of this code. Only the governmental body that enacts the code into law has such authority. Code Development Committee Responsibilities (Letter Designations in Front of Section Numbers or Definitions) In each code development cycle, proposed changes to the code are considered at the Code Devel- opment Hearings by the International Property Maintenance/Zoning Code Development Commit- tee, whose action constitutes a recommendation to the voting membership for final action on the proposed change. Proposed changes to a code section that has a number beginning with a letter in brackets are considered by a different code development committee. For example, proposed changes to definitions that have [B] in front of them (e.g., [B] DWELLING UNIT) are considered by one of the International Building Code Development Committees (IBC-General) at the code devel- opment hearings. The content of sections or definitions in this code that begin with a letter designation is main- tained by another code development committee in accordance with the following: [A] = Administrative Code Development Committee and [B] International Building Code Development Committee (IBC—Fire Safety, General, Means of Egress or Structural). Note that, for the development of the 2015 edition of the |-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees and they will meet in separate years. The groupings are as follows:  Group A Codes Group B Codes (Heard in 2012, Code Change Proposals (Heard in 2013, Code Change Proposals Deadline: January 3, 2012) Deadline: January 3, 2013) International Building Code Administrative Provisions (Chapter 1 all codes except IRC and ICC PC, administrative updates to currently ref- erenced standards, and designated definitions)    International Fuel Gas Code International Energy Conservation Code International Mechanical Code International Existing Building Code International Plumbing Code International Fire Code International Private Sewage International Green Construction Code Disposal Code  ICC Performance Code  International Property Maintenance Code International Residential Code  International Swimming Pool and Spa Code  International Wildland-Urban Interface Code    International Zoning Code  2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” Code change proposals submitted for code sections that have a letter designation in front of them will be heard by the respective committee responsible for such code sections. Because differ- ent committees will meet in different years, it is possible that some proposals for this code will be heard by a committee in a different year than the year in which the primary committee for this code meets. For example, the definition of “dwelling unit” in Section 202 is designated as the responsibility of the International Building Code Development Committee. This committee will hold its code devel- opment hearings in 2012 to consider all code change proposals to the international Building Code. Therefore, any proposals to this definition in Chapter 2 will be needed to be submitted by January 3, 2012, for consideration in 2012 by the appropriate International Building Code Committee (IBC- General). Note that every section of Chapter 1 of this code is designated as the responsibility of the Admin- istrative Code Development Committee, and that committee is part of the Group B portion of the code hearings. This committee will hold its code development hearings in 2013 to consider all code change proposals for Chapter 1 of this code and proposals for Chapter 1 of all |-Codes except the International Residential Code and the ICC Performance Code. Therefore, any proposals received for Chapter 1 of this code will be deferred for consideration in 2013 by the Administrative Provisions Committee. It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understand which code devel- opment committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code change proposal. For further information on the code development committee responsibilities, please visit the ICC web site at www.iccsafe.org/scoping. Marginal Markings Italicized Terms There have been no technical revisions between the 2009 and 2012 editions of this code. Therefore, there are no marginal markings in this edition. Selected terms set forth in Chapter 2, Definitions, are italicized where they appear in code text. Such terms are not italicized where the definition set forth in Chapter 2 does not impart the intended meaning in the use of the term. The terms selected have definitions which the user should read carefully to facilitate better understanding of the code. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” Vv vi 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE Effective Use of the International Zoning Code The International Zoning Code (IZC) is a model code that regulates minimum zoning requirements for new buildings. The IZC is a planning and community development document. The IZC is intended to provide for the arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses and establish provisions for the location of all types of uses, in the interest of the social and economic welfare of the community. Arrangement and Format of the 2012 IZC Before applying the requirements of the IZC, it is beneficial to understand its arrangement and for- mat. The IZC, like other codes published by ICC, is arranged and organized to follow sequential steps that generally occur during a plan review or inspection. The IZC is divided into 14 different parts:            Chapters Subjects 1 Scope and Administration 2 Definitions 3 Use Districts 4 Agricultural Zones 5 Residential Zones 6 Commercial and Commercial/Residential Zones 7 Factory/Industrial Zones 8 General Provisions 9 Special Regulations 10 Sign Regulations 11 Nonconforming Structures and Uses 12 Conditional Uses 13 Planned Unit Development 14 Referenced Standards    The following is a chapter-by-chapter synopsis of the scope and intent of the provisions of the International Zoning Code: Chapter 1 Scope and Administration. This chapter contains provisions for the application, enforcement and administration of subsequent requirements of the code. In addition to establish- ing the scope of the code, Chapter 1 identifies which buildings and structures come under its pur- view. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with maintaining “due process of law” in enforcing the zoning criteria contained in the body of the code. Only through careful observation of the administrative provisions can the building official reasonably expect to demonstrate that “equal protection under the law” has been provided. Chapter 2 Definitions. All terms that are defined in the code are listed alphabetically in Chapter 2. While a defined term may be used in one chapter or another, the meaning provided in Chapter 2 is applicable throughout the code. Additional definitions regarding signs are found in Chapter 10. These are not listed in Chapter 2. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” vii viii Where understanding of a term’s definition is especially key to or necessary for understanding of a particular code provision, the term is shown in italics wherever it appears in the code. This is true only for those terms that have a meaning that is unique to the code. In other words, the generally understood meaning of a term or phrase might not be sufficient or consistent with the meaning pre- scribed by the code; therefore, it is essential that the code-defined meaning be known. Guidance regarding tense, gender and plurality of defined terms as well as guidance regarding terms not defined in this code is provided. Chapter 3 Use Districts. Chapter 3 identifies classifications for typical zoning districts and pro- vides for the application of minimum district areas, in order to regulate and restrict the locations for uses and locations of buildings designated for specific areas and to regulate the minimum required areas or yards and courts and important open-areas property. This chapter also requires coordination of the established zoning districts with approved zoning maps. Further, this chapter also contains information on the minimum requirements for conditional use areas, which includes particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, estab- lished or intended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. Chapter 3, along with Chapters 4 through 7 establish the criteria to classify properties into com- patible use districts. Chapter 4 Agricultural Zones. Chapter 4 identifies three divisions of agricultural zones includ- ing any area to be designated as open space, agricultural uses and land used for public parks and similar uses. After the specific zoning areas are established, this chapter provides minimum bulk zoning regulations to establish lot area, structure-to-open space density, lot dimensions, and set- back and building height requirements. For example, within an agricultural zone 2 there is a limit of one dwelling unit per 10 acres with a minimum lot area of 10 acres. Lot dimensions are required to be 400 feet wide by 400 feet deep minimum for this parcel of ground. Chapter 5 Residential Zones. The objective of Chapter 5 is to define residential uses for a juris- diction to utilize in arranging compatible land uses in order to achieve the maximum social and eco- nomic benefit for the community. This chapter identifies three divisions of residential zones including single-family, two-family and multiunit residential uses. Once the particular zones are established, provisions for the minimum bulk zoning regulations, such as lot area, structure-to- Open-space density, lot dimensions, setback and building height requirements, are indicated. For example, based on Table 502.1, a Division 2b residential lot would restrict the overall building height to 35 feet and establish a minimum front yard of 15 feet, side yard of 5 feet, and rear yard of 20 feet while requiring a minimum overall lot size of 6,000 square feet. Chapter 6 Commercial and Commercial/Residential Zones. Chapter 6 identifies four divi- sions of commercial zones, including C1, which includes minor automotive repair and automotive fuel dispensing facilities; C2, which includes light commercial and group care facilities; C3, which includes amusement centers including bowling alleys, golf driving ranges, miniature golf courses, ice skating rinks, pool and billiard halls; and C4, which includes major automotive repair, manufacturing and commercial centers. This chapter also contains two divisions of commercial/residential zones that accommodate residential uses in light and medium commercial zones (Divisions 1 and 2). Once the particular zones are established, Chapter 6 provides specific minimum bulk zoning restrictions to include lot area, structure-to-open-space density, lot dimensions, and setback and building height requirements. Chapter 7 Factory/Industrial Zones. The objective of Chapter 7 is to define factory/industrial uses for a jurisdiction to utilize in arranging compatible land uses for the social and economic wel- fare of the community. This chapter identifies three divisions of factory/industrial zones including a range of factory/industrial zones from light manufacturing or industrial, such as warehouses and auto body shops (Division 1), to heavy manufacturing or industrial, such as automotive dismantling and petroleum refineries (Division 3). Once the particular zones are established, Chapter 7 provides minimum bulk zoning regulations that establish lot area, structure-to-open-space density, lot dimensions, and setback and building height requirements. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” Chapter 8 General Provisions. Chapter 8 contains general zoning provisions along with require- ments for elements that are common to most uses recognized by this code, to include parking stall dimensions, driveway width requirements, allowable projections into required yard spaces, land- scaping and loading space size requirements. This chapter also establishes the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for specific uses, fence height requirements specific to front, side and rear yard locations, accessory buildings and minimum separation distance requirements from accessory buildings to the main building on the same lot, maximum allowable projection encroach- ment into the required front and rear yards, and landscaping requirements for new buildings and additions and maintenance requirements for existing landscaping. Chapter 8 also provides for the jurisdiction to specifically review and approve the availability of essential services infrastructure for all new projects with a focus on sewer, potable water, street lighting and fire hydrants. Chapter 9 Special Regulations. Chapter 9 recognizes two unique uses, home office and adult- use businesses, and establishes requirements to address each based on their characteristics and potential impact related to other uses/zoning districts. With respect to home occupations, Chapter 9 contains restrictions that include maximum allowable floor area for both the home occupation and the storage for same, exterior display and patron and parking allowances. With respect to adult uses, Chapter 9 requires adult uses to obtain a conditional-use permit and contains a list of four specific location requirements for adult uses. Chapter 10 Sign Regulations. The primary purpose of Chapter 10 is to establish the regulation for the use of signs and sign structures. This chapter addresses the various sign types, provides numerous figures that show examples of general signs, roof signs, wall signs and fascia signs, and addresses the computation methodology of sign area for code compliance. Chapter 10 also contains the general provisions that apply to sign placement, maintenance, repair and removal, as well as requirements for wall, free-standing, directional and temporary signs. Chapter 11 Nonconforming Structures and Uses. Chapter 11 contains provisions for noncon- forming structures and uses regulated under this code. The primary purpose of this chapter is to ensure that existing structures and current land use practices legally established prior to the adop- tion of the International Zoning Code are allowed to be continued. This chapter also describes the criteria that a nonconforming structure or use must meet in order to be allowed to be maintained unchanged. Specific criteria is provided for the discontinuance of a nonconforming use to include vacancy and damage. Chapter 11 also describes the restrictions on enlargements and modifications to a nonconforming structure. Chapter 12 Conditional Uses. Chapter 12 establishes the requirements for conditional uses based on the occasional need for a use not normally permitted in a particular zoning district and due to the unique characteristics and service that use provides to the public. This chapter contains requirements for conditional use permits, minimum documentation required to support a condi- tional use property, and fees. Further, Chapter 12 establishes the criteria for expiration and revoca- tion of conditional use permit and includes a provision that allows the applicant to submit an amendment to a conditional use permit. Chapter 13 Planned Unit Development. Chapter 13 identifies the code requirements for planned unit developments and describes the important role of the planning commission. The pri- mary purpose of this chapter is to permit and encourage diversification, variation, and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic development with relationship to public services, and to encourage and facilitate the preservation of open lands. This chapter contains the specific condi- tions for planned unit developments, including area, uses, ownership and open space requirements. Chapter 14 Referenced Standards. The code contains numerous references to standards that are used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 14 contains a comprehensive list of all standards that are referenced in the code. The standards are part of the code to the extent of the referenced standard. Compliance with the referenced standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with the code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and available on an equal basis to the code official, contractor, designer and owner. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” ix This chapter is organized to facilitate locating specific standards, by listing all of the referenced standards, alphabetically, by acronym of the promulgating agency of the standard. Each agency’s standards are then listed in either alphabetical or numeric order based upon the standard identifi- cation. The list also contains the title of the standard; the edition (date) of the standard referenced; any addenda included as part of the ICC adoption; and the section or sections of this code that ref- erenced the standard. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” LEGISLATION The Jnternational Codes are designed and promulgated to be adopted by reference by legislative action.

Said map and subsequent amendments thereto shall be considered as a part of this code. SECTION 304 ANNEXED TERRITORY 304.1 Classification. Any territory hereafter annexed shall automatically, upon such annexation, be classified as R, Divi- sion la, residential district, and be subject to all conditions and regulations applicable to property in such district. SECTION 305 CONDITIONAL USES 305.1 General. The principal objective of this zoning code is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible build- ings and land uses, and for the property location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various use districts established by this code. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each dis- trict, there are certain additional uses which it may be neces- sary to allow because of the unusual characteristics of the service they provide the public. These conditional uses require particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, established or intended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and operation of such special uses are established by the applicable sections of this code. 13 14 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” uses shall be: SECTION 401 AGRICULTURAL ZONES DEFINED 401.1 Agricultural zone.

Planned unit developments (PUDs) shall be allowed by planning commission approval in any zoning district. No such planned unit development permit shall be granted unless such development will meet the use limita- tions of the zoning district in which it is located and meet the density and other limitations of such districts, except as such requirements may be lawfully modified as provided by this code. Compliance with the regulations of this code in no way excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of a subdivision ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the approval of the application for the planned unit development. 1301.2 Intent. These regulations are to encourage and pro- vide means for effecting desirable and quality development by permitting greater flexibility and design freedom than that permitted under the basic district regulations, and to accom- plish a well-balanced, aesthetically satisfying city and eco- nomically desirable development of building sites within a PUD. These regulations are established to permit latitude in the development of the building site if such development is found to be in accordance with the purpose, spirit and intent of this ordinance and is found not to be hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment, property values or the character of the neighborhood or the health, safety and welfare of the community. It is intended to permit and encourage diversification, variation and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures for developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic develop- ment with relationship to public services, and to encourage and facilitate the preservation of open lands. SECTION 1302 CONDITIONS 1302.1 Area. No planned unit development shall have an area less than that approved by the planning commission as ade- quate for the proposed development. 1302.2 Uses. A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted in the zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of zoning district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a permitted use in a planned unit development, which allows residential uses and shall be governed by density, design and other requirements of the planned unit development permit. Where a site is situated in more than one use district, the permitted uses applicable to such property in one district may be extended into the adjacent use district. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” 1302.3 Ownership. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property. 1302.4 Design. The planning commission shall require such arrangements of structures and open spaces within the site development plan as necessary to ensure that adjacent proper- ties will not be adversely affected. 1302.4.1 Density. Density of land use shall in no case be more than 15 percent higher than allowed in the zoning district. 1302.4.2 Arrangement. Where feasible, the least height and density of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of the development. 1302.4.3 Specific regulations. Lot area, width, yard, height, density and coverage regulations shall be deter- mined by approval of the site development plan. 1302.5 Open spaces. Preservation, maintenance and owner- ship of required open spaces within the development shall be accomplished by either: 1. Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway sys- tem; or 2. Creating a permanent, open space easement on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of an owners’ association established with articles of asso- ciation and bylaws, which are satisfactory to the legis- lative body. 1302.6 Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the uses within the site and as a means of integrat- ing the proposed development into its surroundings shall be planned and presented to the planning commission for approval, together with other required plans for the develop- ment. A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings shall be prepared for the entire site to be developed. A grading and drainage plan shall also be submitted to the planning commission with the application. 1302.7 Signs. The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the intensity and direction of area or floodlighting shall be detailed in the application. 1302.8 Desirability. The proposed use of the particular loca- tion shall be shown as necessary or desirable, to provide a service or facility that will contribute to the general well being of the surrounding area. It shall also be shown that under the circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the planned unit development. 49 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SECTION 1303 PLANNING COMMISSION DETERMINATION 1303.1 Considerations. In carrying out the intent of this sec- tion, the planning commission shall consider the following principles: 1. It is the intent of this section that site and building plans for a PUD shall be prepared by a designer or team of designers having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in the application. The commis- sion shall be permitted to require the applicant to engage such professional expertise as a qualified designer or design team. . It is not the intent of this section that control of the design of a PUD by the planning commission be so rig- idly exercised that individual initiative be stifled and substantial additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this sec- tion. . The planning commission shall be authorized to approve or disapprove an application for a PUD. In an approval, the commission shall be permitted to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to secure compliance with the purposes set forth in this chapter. The denial of an application for a PUD by the planning com- mission shall be permitted to be appealed to the legislative body of the jurisdiction. SECTION 1304 REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS 1304.1 General. The legislative body, as part of the approval of a PUD, shall be permitted to require an applicant to make reasonable contributions to include, but not limited to any combination of the following: 1. 2. 3. Dedication of land for public park purposes. Dedication of land for public school purposes. Dedication of land for public road right-of-way pur- poses. . Construction of, or addition to, roads serving the pro- posed project when such construction or addition is rea- sonably related to the traffic to be generated. 5. Installation of required traffic safety devices. . Preservation of areas containing significant natural, environmental, historic, archeological or similar resources. SECTION 1305 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION 1305.1 Approval. The planning commission shall have the authority to require that the following conditions for a 50 planned unit development (among others it deems appropri- ate) be met by the applicant: 1. That the proponents intend to start construction within 1 year of either the approval of the project or of any necessary zoning district change, and intend to com- plete said construction, or approved stages thereof, within 4 years from the date construction begins. 2. That the development is planned as one complex land use rather than as an aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses. 1305.2 Limitations on application. 1. Upon approval of a PUD, construction shall proceed only in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the planning commission and in compli- ance with any conditions attached by the jurisdiction as to its approval. . Amendment to approved plans and specifications for a PUD shall be obtained only by following the proce- dures here outlined for first approval. 3. The code official shall not issue any permit for any pro- posed building, structure or use within the project unless such building, structure or use is in accordance with the approved development plan and with any con- ditions imposed in conjunction with its approval. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” CHAPTER 14 REFERENCED STANDARDS This chapter lists the standards that are referenced in various sections of this document.
