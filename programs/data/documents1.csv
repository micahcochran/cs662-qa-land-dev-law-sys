Thomasville Municipal Code Last amended 6-21-17 Page 117 of 137  Section 22-502 (j): Landmark Building Landmark Buildings are designed for occupancy by public or commercial uses that provide important services to the community, including recreation, education, safety, assembly, and related functions. They contribute significantly to the quality of the neighborhood and often serve as the focal point of a civic space, terminate a vista, or are placed at a prominent location. The architectural quality and construction of a Landmark Building shall be of the highest level and exceed that of nearby buildings. Review Process:  Design and Disposition (Dimensional Requirements) All Landmark Buildings shall be negotiated on a case-by case basis with the supervising planner prior to application. Building Location:  The following criteria should be considered when determining the location of a Landmark Building within the community, on the block, and on the lot: 1. Primary function; 2. Perceived level of importance to the community; 3. Desired level of formality; and 4. Sense of permanence. Location within the Community and Block Buildings shall be sited at prominent locations and oriented toward a public street or public space in a manner that: 1. Provides a corner or midblock terminating vista;  2. Anchors a civic space; or 3. Fronts a street and civic space. Location on the Lot (Setback) Landmark Buildings often benefit from being set back from the adjacent build-to lines of private development, thereby: 1. Allowing the scale of the building to have more visual emphasis; and 2. Creating a public space in the foreground. The amount of this setback should be carefully determined based on programming and the urban design objectives of the particular site. Multiple Buildings / Campus Facilities with multiple buildings or a campus-like setting shall comply with the standards of Sub-section 502 (k) (Multi-building & Campus Development). Building Type and Character  The following facilities may be designed to an existing building type: 1. Private and quasi-public Clubs or Lodges; 2. Small scaled Cultural Facilities such as museums; 3. Public Recreation Centers and Similar Facilities that are minor or secondary in nature; and 4. Small to medium-scaled Bus Passenger Stations in which passenger boarding occurs outside the building. Structures that draw inspiration from an existing building type may be integrated into the urban fabric or streetscape with little to no additional emphasis. All other Landmark Buildings shall be designed as freestanding, “monumental” structures that evoke pride in one’s community and convey a sense of timelessness. Thomasville Municipal Code Last amended 6-21-17 Page 118 of 137  Vehicle Access and Parking To the maximum extent practicable: 1. Parking shall not be located between a principal or secondary façade and a primary or secondary street; 2. Parking requirements for the site shall be met with on-street parallel and angled parking spaces, or via a remote parking lot or structure; 3. Parking shall be accessed from a side street or alley; 4. Parking drives and access shall be shared with adjacent lots; and 5. Drop-off, pick-up, and stacking for the site shall occur on or along a public street (may be privately owned). If the building is sited in a public space, vehicular access shall be limited to service and emergency vehicles utilizing pedestrian walkways of sufficient width and construction. Building Design  Facades and Entrances A façade that fronts a primary street shall be considered to be the building’s principal façade, and a façade that fronts a secondary street shall be considered to be the buildings secondary facade. 1. The principal façade shall be designed to be the most prominent façade of the building. 2. Building entrances shall always take access from the most prominent façades. Additional entrances may be provided along secondary and axillary facades. Required Frontages Building fronts shall have at least one of the following: porch, stoop, gallery, colonnade, arcade, terrace, balcony, marquee, canopy, or awning. Massing 1. Symmetrical in form. 2. The appearance of a balanced design increases the level of formality, and shall be encouraged. 3. Massing, while often larger as a whole, should be divided into visually distinct sections. 4. Massing divisions should provide visual order to the building and create vertical proportions within individual elements. 5. On corner lots Landmark Buildings shall be designed with two façades of equal, though not identical architectural quality. 6. Landmark Buildings located in a civic space shall be designed with four façades of equal, though not identical architectural quality. Scale:  Size In order to be more visually prominent across greater distances, the scale of the building should be larger than that of nearby buildings. Building height 3 stories max. 48 ft. above grade, max. (excluding appurtenances). Story height Floor-to-ceiling heights and architectural details should be proportionately larger than those of nearby private buildings. Thomasville Municipal Code Last amended 6-21-17 Page 119 of 137  Roof Appurtenances Spires, steeples, towers, cupolas, and belfries can visually extend the height of the building, and shall be incorporated when practicable. Materials:  Buildings shall use durable, high quality materials that convey a sense of permanence. These include, but are not limited to brick, stone, and cast concrete. Wood construction is appropriate, but should only be executed with the highest quality framing and cladding materials. Generally, stucco should be avoided as a material that lacks scale and texture. If used, stucco should be traditional, have integral pigment, and be scored to define human-scaled dimensions on the façade. Specific to Churches and Places of Worship  In addition to the above standards, Churches and Places of Worship shall: 1. Traditional Design. A church should be easily identifiable with timeless features such as bell towers, steeples, clearstory windows, and stained glass integrated into the design. Traditionally designed buildings can be navigated easily based on intuition without much signage. For example, if a sign or large symbol (e.g. cross) is needed to identify the sanctuary then the design can be improved. 2. Vertical Massing. The scale of the sanctuary building should not overwhelm the block. Building features such as arches, columns, pilasters, rooflines (including dormers), and masonry patterns shall divide and create a vertical orientation on larger surfaces. Once these proportions have been established, windows (including clearstory) and doors shall reinforce the vertical orientation of the composition. 3. Be Transparent. Being able to see and hear a little bit of what's going on inside makes a church seem less intimidating and peeks the interest of those passing by. This is the same principal as “window-shopping,” only adapted to a church. It is not uncommon for people to join a service after hearing music wafting through the doors of a church. 4. Define Entrances. The church’s buildings should be open and inviting, with a clear sense of where to enter. In no case shall a church’s side doors function as a primary entry point. 5. Entrances Close to Pedestrians. Use frontage elements such as porches, stoops, galleries, arcades, and canopies to bring the church up to the street or public space, while still providing an area for people to gather. 6. Doors. Church doors should be prominent and inviting. 7. Parking. Parking lots disrupt the neighborhood fabric and discourage members from walking to and from church, resulting in less patronage of local shops and cafes. Parking should be on-street, or shared with other commercial or institutional buildings in the vicinity. 8. Create a Community Focal Point. Add neighborhood- friendly features such as athletic fields, tennis or basketball courts, a playground, an outdoor amphitheater, etc. 9. Permeable Campus. Churches that span more than one block shall ensure that their campus is permeable, allowing people to walk through the property using multiple routes. Use:  This building type / lot may only house Churches or Other Place of Worship; Public Owned Recreation Centers, YMCA’s and Institutions of a Similar Nature; Schools (Public or Private); Business Schools; Clubs or Lodges (Private); Colleges or Universities; Cultural Facilities; Railroad or Bus Passenger Stations; and Municipal Structures as defined in Section 508 (Uses). Thomasville Municipal Code Last amended 6-21-17 Page 120 of 137  Section 22-502 (k): Multi-building and Campus Development The following standards apply to all multi-building developments, regardless of function, except: 1. Single and Two-Family Residential development. 2. Mini-Storage Buildings. Only the preceding building types found in this code shall be utilized when assembling a multi-building and campus development. Site Planning:  To the maximum extent practicable a campus or site with multiple buildings shall: 1. Maintain or establish an uninterrupted and interconnected network of blocks, streets, and alleys as conveyed in Section 501 (General to All Development); 2. Design all public or private vehicular rights of way, easements, access-ways, and driveways that are internal to a site as complete (multi-modal) thoroughfares that incorporate on-street parking, sidewalks, lighting, plantings, streetscape elements (furniture, wayfinding signage, etc. ), terminated vistas, and where appropriate, bicycle lanes. 3. Configure and locate buildings to define street edges, development entry points, and spaces for gathering between buildings; 4. Frame and enclose parking areas, public spaces, and site amenities on at least three sides; and 5. Locate public gathering spaces at prominent corners. Building Orientation:  The building façade containing the primary entrance shall be considered as the principal façade. To the maximum extent practicable: 1. Perimeter and interior buildings shall be oriented so that the principal facade faces a public street or public space (street or space may be privately owned); and 2. Tenet buildings or outparcel buildings shall “wrap” the overall site, establishing a walkable street frontage. Generally, and where applicable, buildings shall be sited at prominent corners first. Parking: There shall be no parking between a building and the street it fronts, except: 1. On-street parallel or angled parking; or 2. Conventional “front-loaded” parking lots are permitted for buildings with footprints >35,000 sf. provided:  The building and parking is sited internal to the lot / block;  The building and parking is constructed as part of a larger, multi-building project as conveyed and depicted above;  The facility and parking is “wrapped” by perimeter buildings as conveyed and depicted above; and  The “front-loaded” parking area abuts a “rear” or “side-loaded” parking area for one or more perimeter buildings on the site (See Diagram above). If possible, this parking shall be shared. Street Trees:  All internal streets shall contain regularly spaced street trees planted a min. of 30 ft. o.c. avg. Pedestrian Walkways:  Pedestrian walkways internal to a multi-building site shall: 1. Connect the site and all buildings with the larger pedestrian network that surrounds; 2. Be provided along the full length of building facades with an entryway or facing off-street parking areas; and 3. Provide crosswalks at all intersections and other street crossings (both internal and external to the site) where a high-level of pedestrian movement is anticipated.

Thomasville Municipal Code Last amended 6-21-17 Page 121 of 137  Section 22-503: Frontages and Building Elements Porches and Stoops Porches and stoops provide outdoor living space. Often, they provide protection from the sun, while still permitting breezes to infiltrate the body of the building. They provide architectural interest and delineate the building’s entrance. This type is appropriate for residential building types with small setbacks. Typically, the porch or stoop is located in the build-to-zone as close to the sidewalk as possible. It is elevated to ensure privacy within the building from those passing by. Stairs may lead directly to the sidewalk or may be side-loaded. Depth Porch = 8 ft. min. ;  Stoop = 4 ft. min. ; 8 ft. max. Length Porch = 25% to 100% of building front; 10 ft. min. Stoop = 5 ft. min. ; 8 ft. max. Height, Clear = 8 ft. min. Height = 2 stories max. Porches and stoops may have multi-story verandas and / or balconies above. Finish Level Above Grade = 2 ft. min. ; 5 ft. max. (no more than 8” below the first interior finished floor level). Porches and stoops may occur forward of the build-to line, but shall not extend into the right-of-way. They may extend into the ROW upon the approval of an easement by the Architectural Review / Zoning Appeals Board. Stairs may extend forward of the build-to line into the right-of-way, or upon a utility easement if constructed of non- masonry, breakaway materials. Full sidewalk clearance shall be maintained. Porches and stoops are un-airconditioned. Screens on front porches are prohibited. Galleries, Colonnades, Arcades, and Terraces This frontage is associated with commercial uses, and is permitted to encroach upon the setback, or even into the right of way over the sidewalk. The space allows one to window-shop or dine in a shaded environment that also captures breezes. The frontage provides architectural interest and delineates the building’s entrance. Upper stories may be enclosed, providing livable bonus space for occupants. Depth  Gallery = 8 ft. min. from front wall of bldg. to the inside column face. Colonnade / Arcade = 10 ft. min. from front wall of the building to  the inside column face. Length = 75% to 100% of building front. On corners, may wrap around the side of the building facing the side street. Height, Clear = 10 ft. min. Height = 2 stories max. Additional stories may be permitted by the supervising planner. Colonnades and Arcades have 2 or more stories, with upper stories enclosed as habitable space. Finish Level Above Grade = 0” – 6” max. Galleries, Colonnades, Arcades, and Terraces may occur forward of the build-to line, but may only extend into the right- of-way (to within 2 ft. of curb) upon the approval of an easement by the Arch.

Balconies A balcony is connected to a building’s upper stories and is supported by either a cantilever or by columns on one side. This type is appropriate for residential and commercial buildings with small setbacks. Typically, the balcony is located forward of the build-to-zone over the sidewalk. It allows occupants of the building to experience the activities of the street while also providing significant privacy from those passing by. Depth 2nd Story = 5 ft. min. Upper Story = 3 ft. min. Length = 25% to 100% of building front; 5 ft. min. Height, Clear =  1st floor residential = 9 ft. min. 1st floor non-residential = 10 ft. min. ; 8 ft. min with suspended signage. Supporting brackets are exempt. Balconies shall occur forward of the build-to line and may encroach over the right-of-way to within 2 ft. of the curb. Balconies shall be made of wood or metal and may have roofs, but are required to be open, un-airconditioned spaces. Balconies in the rear of the building may have screens. Ideally, balconies should be supported from below by visible brackets, scaled as if they are supporting the weight of the mass, or from above by suspension cables or chains. On corners, balconies may wrap around the side of the building facing the side street. Marquees, Canopies, and Awnings A permanently roofed architectural projection whose sides are either vertical or horizontal and are supported entirely from an exterior wall of a building. This frontage is typically used for the display of signs. Horizontal marquees, canopies, and awnings provide shade from the sun, as well as enhanced weather protection for both the building and the passerby. Depth = 5 ft. min. Length = 25% to 100% of building front. Height, Clear = 8 ft. min. (including suspended signage). The above requirements apply to the 1st floor only. There are no dimensional requirements for marquees, canopies, and awnings above the 1st floor. Sign copy on marquees, canopies, and awnings on 2nd story windows is not permitted. Marquees, canopies, and awnings shall occur forward of the build-to line and may encroach over the right-of-way to within 2 ft. of the curb. Marquees and canopies must be visually supported from below by brackets, or from above by suspension cables or ns. The top of each awning shall be at the same height as the top of each opening below. Awnings shall be made of fabric. Vinyl and high-gloss or plasticized fabrics are prohibited. Backlit awnings are prohibited.

Building Location and Circulation. The dimensional and design standards established in this overlay code for building types and parking shall apply. In no case shall a vehicular access way / driveway or off-street parking area be permitted between the front façade of the building and the frontage street; or in the case of a corner lot, between the side façade of the building and the side street. Exception: buildings with a footprint in excess of 35,000 sf. that comprise a multi-building or campus development (See Section 22-502 (k)). 2. Access. Drive-through access may only occur from the front if there is no adjacent side street or alleyway. 3. Configuration. Drive-throughs shall be located to the side or at the rear of the building and shall be designed so that pedestrian safety is ensured. 4. Corner Lot. Drive-throughs serving a building located on a corner lot shall be located to the rear or interior side. In no case shall the drive-through be located on the side of a building facing a street. 5. Types. Both remote drive-through technology (in which objects are placed in a capsule and delivered to the drive- through via a tube) and attached drive-throughs are permitted. 6. Roof. If covered, the roof over the drive-through shall be of a complementary architectural design as the design covering the primary portion of the structure.

This includes residential building types that are utilized for either residential or commercial purposes, and commercial building types that are used for a mix of non-residential purposes. Essential characteristics include: 1. Raised or at-grade foundations. 2. A clearly discernable base (e.g. foundation / water table), middle, and top (e.g. roof) on each building. 3. The use of permanent and durable materials. 4. Buildings are typically simple combinations of one or more rectangular forms. 5. Simple, 2 to 2.5 story massing, with predominantly gabled or hipped roof forms, and some parapeted roofs. 6. Both enclosed eaves with simplified classical detailing and exposed rafter ends. 7. Porches with simplified classical detailing. 8. Mixed architectural vocabulary, utilizing wood, stucco, and masonry. Residential Buildings Residential structures find precedent in the vernacular one and one-half-story cottages, two-story houses with porches, and larger estates of downtown Thomasville. Multi-family Buildings Multi-family buildings find precedent in the mansion apartment houses and rowhouses of downtown Thomasville and are configured to resemble a large single-family house, or row of three or more attached townhouses. Commercial Buildings Commercial buildings are typically commercial in character, appearing as detached, single-use structures with parapetted or gabled, pedimented roof forms, and formal shopfronts or workshops. Mixed-use Buildings Mixed-use structures are modest in scale, and appear as detached, multi-story commercial buildings. Massing:  General 1.

Boundaries and Establishment of Districts A R T I C L E V I I  B O U N D AR I E S A N D E S T AB L I S H M E N T O F D I S T R I C T S  This article provides for the definition of district boundaries and the establishment of districts for the various uses of land within the City. SECTION 701. BOUNDARIES OF DISTRICTS. The boundaries of the districts are established as shown on the Zoning Map of the municipality. Unless otherwise shown on said Zoning Map, the boundaries of districts are lot lines, the center lines of streets or alleys or such lines extended, railroad right-of-way lines, or the corporate limit lines as they existed at the time of enactment of this Ordinance. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps the following rules shall apply:  1.

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 52 Article VIII. Use Provisions for Zoning Districts A R T I C L E V I I I  U S E P R O V I S I O N S F O R Z O N I N G D I S T R I C T S  The purpose of this Article is to provide for the determination of uses compatible with the various Zoning Districts established in Article VIl. Each of the use districts as defined and established in “Article VII: Boundaries and Establishment of Districts” shall be subject to specific regulations regarding uses permitted, uses permitted by conditional use, uses not permitted, required lot area and width, yard setbacks, and maximum building height. SECTION 801. USE LIMITATIONS. Although a use may be permitted according to specified procedures in a particular district, such use may not necessarily be permitted on every parcel of land in the district. A use may be permitted only if it can meet all of the standards of this Ordinance and other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. SECTION 802. INTERPRETATIONS OF USES. This Ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings given the infinite variations of essentially similar uses. Therefore, the Building Inspector is empowered to make interpretations so as to classify any questioned use within a listed use classification of most similar impact and characteristics. However, in no case shall the Building Inspector interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in question is more similar in impact and characteristics to another listed use. Appeals of the Building Inspector’s use interpretation may be made to the Board of Adjustment. SECTION 803. UNCLASSIFIED USES. In the event the Building Inspector receives application for permitting of a use that is not listed or that cannot appropriately fit a use listed in “Section 804.00: Uses Allowed”, the following procedure shall apply:  1. If compatible with the existing use district intent, the unclassified use may be permitted as a conditional use by the Planning Commission pursuant to “Section 306: Conditional Use Regulations”. 2. If the unclassified use would not be compatible with the intent of the existing use district, the Building Inspector shall make a determination of the most appropriate use district, and require the applicant have the property rezoned, and conditional use granted by the Planning Commission pursuant to “Section 306: Conditional Use Regulations” before granting approval. 3. Following final action of the unclassified use per above paragraphs, the Planning Commission may initiate an amendment to this Ordinance to list the newly permitted use in the most appropriate district(s). SECTION 804.00. USES ALLOWED. Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Ordinance, no building, structure or land shall be used or occupied except in the Zoning Districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in this section. The general use categories specified by Table VIII-1 are defined in Articles X through XIII. Pell City Zoning Ordinance 53 Article VIII. Use Provisions for Zoning Districts Uses allowed in each district are determined from TABLE VIII-1. Categories for each use are:  A. Permitted [P]. Allowed as of right; applicant need only submit the necessary plans for review to the Building Inspector. B. Conditional Use [C]. Further review and special permission is required from the Planning Commission as per Section 306. C. Not Permitted [N]. Use not allowed in this district. D. Subject to Special Use Regulations [*].

Communication Towers and Antennae. {See Ordinance 2015-4497 for revisions to 903.05 through 903.06.06}  903.05.01. Purpose. The purpose of these guidelines is to establish minimum considerations and criteria for the review of communication towers. It is the City of Pell City’s express intent that the construction of new towers be an option of last resort; to the greatest extent feasible, location of antennae on existing towers, and other suitable structures should first be sought. These guidelines are designed to ensure the compatibility of towers with and avoid adverse impacts to nearby properties and discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the City of Pell City. 903.05.02. Applicability. All communication towers and antennae shall met the minimum requirements as prescribed in this ordinance and any additional regulations adopted by the City Council governing the development and construction of communication towers and antennae. 903.05.03. Objectives. The proposed locations and design of all communication towers shall duly consider the following public health, safety and general welfare objectives:  1. Structural Safety. The proposed tower will comply with wind loading and other structural standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. 2. View Protection. The proposed tower facility will be designed to minimize adverse visual  Pell City Zoning Ordinance 60 Article IX. Special Use Regulations impacts to surrounding properties and the public right-of-way, given the topography of the proposed site and surrounding area. 3. Land Use Compatibility. The proposed tower facility will be compatible with the surrounding land uses, given the character of the use and development of the location. 4. Design Harmony. The proposed tower facility will be designed in harmony with the natural setting and the surrounding development pattern as well as to the highest industry standards. 5. Existing Communication Services. The proposed tower facility will comply with FCC and other applicable agency standards so as not to interfere with existing communication services in the area. 6. Health Effects. The proposed tower will comply with all applicable federal, state, county and Town health standards so as not to cause detrimental health effects to persons in the surrounding area. 903.05.04. Development Criteria. The City of Pell City building inspector and town engineer shall review all communications towers requesting permits for compliance with the applicable standards and criteria listed below. These criteria are considered the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The Pell City Planning Commission may also impose higher standards if it deems them to be necessary to further the objectives of this section. 1. Setbacks. A. Where permitted, the distance between the base of the tower, including guys, accessory facilities and property lines abutting urban residential districts, public parks and roads, must equal twenty percent (20%) of the tower height. Property lines adjacent to other uses (e.g. agricultural, industrial) shall require a setback equal to the rear yard setback established for the underlying zone. B. When located within or adjacent to a residential district or dwelling, the minimum standard setback from all adjoining residential property boundaries shall be fifty feet (50’). C. The Site Review by the Planning Commission may reduce the standard setbacks in exceptional cases where a hardship would result due to unusual conditions on the site or other impracticalities. However, the Planning Commission shall not reduce the setbacks to the detriment of affected residential properties. 2. Appearance. A. Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish so as to reduce the visibility of the structure, unless other standards are required by the FAA. B. The design of the tower shall be of a type that has the least visual impact on the surrounding area. C. The design of the tower compound shall, to the greatest extent possible, maximize use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. D. Where communication towers are deemed appropriate for a given location, the type of tower shall be restricted to monopoles in or within 1,000 feet of residential areas and area of special aesthetic concerns such as commercial revitalization areas, historic districts and scenic corridors. 3. Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by FAA or other authority  Pell City Zoning Ordinance 61 Article IX. Special Use Regulations for safety purposes. Where required, the Planning Commission shall review the available lighting alternatives and approve that design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. “Dual lighting” (red at night/strobe during the day) shall be preferred unless restricted by the FAA. Security lighting may be permitted in accordance with “903.05.04.5: Security Devices” below. 4. Landscaping. A. A landscaped buffer shall effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways and residential properties. B. The standard buffer shall consist of a minimum eight feet (8’) wide landscaped strip outside the dark vinyl coated steel security fencing of the perimeter of the compound. The buffer strip shall be planted with an attractive combination of trees, shrubs, vines and/or ground covers that can achieve the full height of the fence at maturity and enhances the outward appearance of the security fence. For sites within 1,000 feet of a residence, the Site Review by the Planning Commission may impose increased buffer standards to include a decay-resistant, solid wood fence, earth berms and brick or masonry walls in addition to the security fencing. All fencing and landscaping shall be maintained by the lessor/owner. C. In isolated non-residential areas, alternative landscaping methods may be accepted, such as the use of earth toned colored, vinyl-coated steel security fencing in combination with four feet of evergreen trees, shrubs, vines and/or other plantings. D. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote, agricultural or rural locations, or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived by the Planning Commission. E. Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers located on large, wooded lots, preservation of substantial natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. F. Cellular facilities utilizing underground vaults in lieu of above ground switching gear buildings shall be exempted from any buffer requirements. 5. Security Devices. The facility shall be fully secured. A minimum eight feet (8’) high, dark vinyl coated steel fence shall be installed around the entire perimeter of the compound (measured to the top of the fence or barbed wired, if applicable). Security fencing shall require screening in accordance with landscaping requirements, as defined above. Other security measures shall include locks and alarms. Approved barbed or razor wire and lighting of the compound shall be permitted, if deemed necessary to fully secure the tower compound. 6. Access. Driveways and parking shall be provided to assure the operator’s access to the facility for maintenance or emergency services. In some cases, parking/access may be from an adjoining alley, public street or off-street parking area. 7. Co-Location. No new tower shall be established if space is structurally, technically and economically available on an existing tower, which would serve the area that, the new tower would serve. Documentation that reasonable efforts have been made by the applicant to achieve co-location shall be submitted in accordance with Section 903.04.05 (5) below. Towers shall be designed to maximize shared use to the greatest extent possible, given the structural and technical limitations of the type of tower proposed. In any event, co-location shall be encouraged. If feasible, each tower shall, at a minimum, be designed for double its intended use for all transmitting and receiving antennae other than microwave dish antennae. 8. Removal of Obsolete Towers. Any tower that is no longer in use for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owners’ expense. The owner shall  Pell City Zoning Ordinance 62 Article IX. Special Use Regulations provide the Building Inspector with a copy of the notice of the FCC of intent to cease operations, which shall be given ninety (90) days from the date of ceasing operations to remove the obsolete tower and accessory structures. In the case of multiple operators sharing use of single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations. 903.05.05. Application. Any application submitted for approval shall submit the following items, in addition to any other required items, to show compliance with these review standards. 1. Statement of Impact on Health, Safety and Welfare. A brief written statement shall address conformance with the health, safety and welfare objectives of this guideline. 2. Site Plan. A scaled site plan shall show the location and dimensions of all improvements, including setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, and other information necessary to determine compliance with the development criteria of these guidelines. 3. Rendering. A rendering of the tower, accessory facilities and compound shall depict colors, materials and treatment. If lighting or other FAA requirements for tower color is proposed, evidence of such requirement shall be submitted. 4. Justification for a New Tower. A proposal for a new tower shall be documented by the applicant that the planned equipment for a proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing tower within the proposed service area. The applicant shall submit a written affidavit showing what attempts have been made to share an existing tower or that no such tower exists. 5. Certification of Shared Use Design. A qualified engineer, registered in the State of Alabama, shall certify that the proposed tower’s structural design can accommodate a minimum of two (2) shared users, in accordance with “ 903.05.04: Development Criteria”. 6. As Built Survey. A qualified professional engineer, registered in the State of Alabama, shall certify that the proposed communication tower was built in accordance with the submitted site plan including the installation of any required buffer yard. 7. Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including the number and types of antennae that can be accommodated. 8. Mitigation measures for ice and other hazardous falling debris, including setbacks and de-icing equipment. 9. Where applicable, adequate parking shall be provided, along with buffers where such tower abuts any residential Zoning District. Such towers shall be prohibited in any residential Zoning District of the City of Pell City, Alabama. 903.05.06. Exceptions. Towers camouflaged to resemble woody trees or indigenous vegetation in order to blend in with the native landscape will be subject to administrative review by the Building Inspector, as are other types of concealment techniques. Concealment techniques are design methods used to blend a wireless telecommunications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the existing surroundings so as to not have the appearance of a wireless telecommunications facility. Such structures shall be considered wireless telecommunications facilities and not spires, belfries, cupolas, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for purposes of applying height limitations. Due to their height, such structures must be designed  Pell City Zoning Ordinance 63 Article IX.

SECTION 1302. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) OVERLAY DISTRICT. A Planned Unit Development Overlay District may overlay, or include, properties located in one or more use districts. The Planning Commission shall, in accord with this Ordinance, apply additional regulation, in the form of design and development review guidelines, to govern development of land within such districts, and those guidelines shall be applied in lieu of or in addition to, as the case may be, other regulations required in the underlying use districts. The Planning Commission may, from time to time and subsequent to a public hearing, add to those guidelines in a manner not inappropriate to the purposes of this district. Pell City Zoning Ordinance 118 Article XIII. Use Provisions for Special Districts  1302.01. Designation of Districts. A Planned Unit Development Overlay District may be established for any tract with a minimum site area of five (5) acres whose development could be undertaken as an integral unit under single ownership or control. Before the City Council shall designate or amend the boundaries of any Planned Unit Development Overlay District(s), the Planning Commission shall first submit a report to the City Council, which shall include the conceptual site plan required by Section 1302.02 and shall, in addition, outline the boundaries of the proposed overlay district and indicate the Commission’s specific intent for development within the overlay district and how implementation of the Comprehensive Plan would be furthered by such development. 1302.02. Application Requirements. A conceptual site plan shall accompany each application for rezoning to the PUD Overlay District. The site plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a professional engineer, land surveyor, architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Alabama. The site plan shall show, in schematic detail, the concept for use and development of the entire PUD overlay district, including the location of the proposed uses and major buildings, the proposed residential density, housing types, dimensional standards for all lots, layout of roads, location of all entrances, and layout and configuration of all common open spaces. The site plan shall be accompanied by a brief narrative text describing the general design and architectural policies for the PUD, treatment of environmentally sensitive lands, and proposed time frame for phased development. 1302.03. Permitted Uses and Development. Development of the PUD shall be in substantial accord with the approved conceptual site plan required in Section 1302.02, and with all other site plan and subdivision approval procedures as required by this Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations. There shall be permitted a mix of uses within a single development and within lots as shown on the Final Subdivision Plat as required by the Subdivision Regulations. Such mix shall reflect and appropriately account for the relative land areas and development densities called for in the underlying use districts, but may relocate, within the spirit of this Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan, such uses within the planned unit development. The purpose of this limitation is to ensure that this overlay district is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to create higher density development than called for by the underlying use districts.

The principal features are the restriction of advertising to the business or use of the premises on which the sign is located and the restriction of the total sign area permissible per site. Any sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification or for advertising a use conducted therein or there on shall be deemed to be accessory and incidental to such land, building or use. It is intended that the display of signs will be appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and be adequate, but not excessive for the intended purpose of identification or advertisement. With respect to signs advertising business use, it is specifically intended among other things, to avoid excessive competition and clutter among sign displays in their demand for public attention. It is further intended that in commercial areas now in existence and more so in proposed commercial and industrial areas that all signs within one complex be coordinated with the architecture in such a manner that an overall appearance is harmonious in color, form and proportion. It is also intended by this section that all temporary signs erected for directional purposes, for public information or to call attention to special events shall be confined to those that are of general public interest and that such signs shall be limited to the giving of information. All other signs commonly referred to as outdoor advertising, billboards or poster panels which advertise products or businesses not connected with the site or building on which they are located, are deemed by this section to constitute a separate use. Any widespread display of outdoor advertising is deemed to be inappropriate to the character and sound development of the City and it is intended that such advertising be confined to unimproved commercial or industrial property subject to the restrictions set forth under Section 1508 below.

Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) District Regulations  4-12-1 Purpose of the TND District The TND District is a mixed-use, planned development district. In this district, land uses and development standards are enumerated but still provide the developer with substantial flexibility to create a unique, self-contained community. The purpose of a Traditional Neighborhood Development Zoning District (“TND District”) is to encourage mixed-use, compact development integrating a variety of land uses within close proximity of one another. This district’s intent is to provide for the traditional development practices and flexible land use alternatives, rather than prohibiting conventional development, by allowing for: 1. Human scale design options; 2. A mixture of uses, including residential, commercial, civic, and open space uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood; 3. A variety of housing types, residential densities, and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes; 4. The incorporation of a system of interconnected streets, roads, drives, with sidewalks and walkways, that offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, for connections to existing and future developments; 5. Building design and other improvements in an arrangement, bulk, form, character and landscaping that establishes a livable, harmonious and diverse environment; 6. The incorporation of environmental features into the design; 7. The coordination of transportation systems with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians and vehicles; 8. Well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenways and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood; 9. The incorporation of architecture, landscaping, lighting and signage standards integrated with the zoning provisions that contribute to the intended design character of the planned development. 4-12-2 Applicability of Other Codes and Ordinances The Madison Code of Ordinances, Zoning Ordinance, and Subdivision Regulations (“Other Codes and Ordinances”) for the City apply to a TND District unless the ordinance authorizing TND zoning expressly provides otherwise. 4-12-3 Approval Process for the TND District In association with a request for TND zoning, the following steps shall be completed. 1.

The installation of any traffic signal under the jurisdiction of the city shall be subject to the accepted standards and approval of the city's traffic engineer. vii. Location and spacing of driveways: The location and spacing of driveways shall be determined as follows: a. Along local streets, access driveways to corner lots shall be located a minimum of 35 feet from the intersection of the projection of right-of-way lines to the centerline of the driveway, except as provided hereinafter. b. Along arterial and collector streets, access driveways to corner lots shall be located a minimum of 150 feet from the intersection of the projection of right-of-way lines to the centerline of the driveway except as provided hereinafter. c. In the event that, due to lot size or location or for other reasons deemed sufficient by the Planning Commission, a corner lot is unable to construct access drives that are at least 150 ft. from the intersection, then the lot may be permitted to construct driveways at the following distances from the intersection:  Table 5-15-5a Corner Clearance at Intersections With Restrictive Median  Table 5-15-5b Without Restrictive Medium Access Minimum Position Allowed (Feet) Approaching Intersection, Right In/Out 115 Approaching Intersection Right IN/Only 75 Departing Intersection Right In/Out 125 Departing Intersection Right Out Only``` 100 Access Minimum Position Allowed (Feet) Approaching Intersection, Full Access 125 Approaching Intersection Right in/Only 100 Departing Intersection Right Full Access 125 Departing Intersection Right Out Only 100  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 119   Along arterial and collector streets, as classified in the Comprehensive Plan, minimum acceptable spacing between double or multiple driveways on the same parcel shall meet the following criteria:     Distances between adjacent 1-way driveways with the ingress drive upstream from the egress drive may be 1/2 the distance shown in Table 1. 1. Driveways shall be located in the most appropriate location, taking into account existing and proposed adjacent and opposing driveways and land use. a. Number of driveways: i. One driveway shall be permitted for ingress and egress purposes to any plot. ii. A joint access driveway shall be considered as adequate access for any 2 adjacent plots and shall be encouraged. For a plot where more than 1 driveway is requested, the applicant shall submit a traffic report justifying the need, describing the internal circulation and parking system, and identifying the impact of the development of the plot and its proposed access facilities on the operation of the street system. iii. Two or more driveways entering the same street from a single plot may be permitted if all applicable requirements of this section are met b. Ingress lanes: i. Ingress left-turn lane requirements: A 12-foot-wide left-turn lane with appropriate storage and transition shall be provided at each driveway where the peak hour inbound left-turn volume is 30 vehicles or more. As an alternative, ingress left-turn lanes may be required when warranted according to a study performed by the project engineer, based on professionally accepted standards, and approved by the City Engineer. ii. Ingress right-turn lanes: For any plot, a 12-foot-wide right-turn lane with appropriate storage and transition shall be provided at each driveway where the highway average daily traffic exceeds 10,000 vehicles per day, permitted highway speeds exceed 35 miles per hour, and driveway volume exceeds 1,000 vehicles per day with at least 40 right-turn movements per hour during peak periods. For any plot, a right-turn lane as described in this paragraph shall be provided at each driveway where right-turn ingress volumes exceed 75 vehicles per peak hour. As an alternative, ingress right-turn lanes may be required when warranted according to a study performed by the project engineer, based on professionally accepted standards, and approved by the City Engineer. c. Required improvements to intersections impacted by development. Improvements to an intersection shall be required to be constructed by the developer of any plot where the Speed limit (mph) Minimum separation (feet) 30 or less 125 31 to 35 245 36 to 45 440 Over 45 660  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 120   development causes the intersection to be impacted by traffic generated as a result of the development. Intersection improvements shall be in accord with the requirements set forth in this section. d. Median openings. To assure traffic safety, capacity and control, median openings located within a traffic way corridor shall be spaced the maximum distance apart that will allow safe and adequate traffic circulations i. Median openings shall be permitted only by the Planning Commission and only where traffic studies justify the need, taking into consideration the following: 1. Potential number of left turns into driveways; 2. Length of frontage along the street right-of-way line of the property proposed to be served; 3. Distance of proposed opening from adjacent intersections or other openings, 4. Length and width of the left-turn storage lane as functions of the estimated maximum number of vehicles to be in the lane during peak hours;  5. Traffic control, including signalization that will be necessary at the median cut. If a traffic signal at a median cut is within 1,500 feet of another traffic signal, the 2 shall be coordinated; and 6. Adopted design guidelines. ii. Public streets shall be given priority consideration for median openings. iii. All median openings shall include adequate storage and transition lanes, where warranted. e. Off-street vehicular circulation. An off-street facility shall have full internal vehicular circulation and storage. Vehicle circulation shall be completely contained within the facility, and vehicles located within one portion of the facility shall have access to all other portions without using the adjacent street system. f. Off-street truck maneuvering. Where the use of a plot includes a truck loading, unloading, parking or service facility, adequate space shall be provided such that all truck maneuvering is performed off the street. g. Off-street vehicle stacking areas. Adequate stacking capacity shall be required for both inbound and outbound vehicles to facilitate the safe and efficient movement between the street and the parking facility. An inbound reservoir shall be of sufficient size to ensure that vehicles will not obstruct the adjacent street, sidewalk and circulation within the facility. An outbound reservoir shall be required to eliminate backup and delay of vehicles within the facility. h. Special considerations and exceptions. In the case of special driveway needs such as service stations, drive-in banks or other high-volume traffic uses, or where property is of a nature that the requirements of this Code cannot be met, an applicant may submit a traffic engineering study requesting technical deviation from these requirements. The traffic engineering study  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 121   shall be performed and certified by a registered professional engineer qualified in traffic engineering. The study will set forth all traffic operations and safety features and minimizes the impact of the special driveway or technical deviation. Based upon the study, and upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, driveways may be approved by the Planning Commission where necessary and in such a manner as to minimize the impact on the adjacent street. i. Administration. i. All applications for driveway and median cut permits shall be made to the Community Development Department, which shall bring the permit application to the Planning Commission along with a recommendation thereon at the Commission’s next scheduled meeting. Only the Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant any permit required by this section. The City shall collect a permit fee of $50.00 to process the application. ii. The approval of a site plan certificate, site plan amendment, or other development order by the Planning Commission clearly depicting a proposed driveway shall serve as the required permit for any driveway so depicted, and no separate permit fee will be collected. Provided that, median cuts shall require the explicit approval of the Planning Commission by affirmative vote and a separate permit fee will be collected. j. Application to existing driveways and off-street parking facilities: i. Any driveway or off-street parking facility existing on the effective date of this ordinance, and which by the terms of this section has become a nonconforming driveway or off-street parking facility is hereby declared not to be in violation of this section, subject to the conditions following herein. ii. In the event of an expansion of an existing use for which a nonconforming driveway and off- street parking facility has been constructed, the provisions of this section shall apply; and the expanded use shall make necessary compliance with the terms and conditions of this section. iii. If an existing driveway or off-street parking facility can be brought into conformance with the requirements of this section by minor alterations to the site, then, if a change on the site is made which necessitates the issuance of a building permit, the adjustments and alterations shall be made on the site to conform with the provisions of this section. 2. Improvement. a. Surfacing, Marking, and Drainage: All off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance and intended for use by the public or by employees, and their access roads within the parking area and leading from the street to said area, shall be paved with an all-weather surface of asphaltic concrete, portland cement concrete or any equivalent material acceptable to the Administrative Officer, and maintained such that no dust will result from continued use. Spaces intended primarily for the parking or storage of heavy equipment, trucks (excluding pickup trucks), or other vehicles not classified as passenger cars by the National Highway Transportation Safety Board need not be paved; however, areas intended primarily for parking of such vehicles shall be spread with gravel of a size, weight and thickness acceptable to the City Engineer. All Spaces shall be arranged and  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 122   marked so as to provide for orderly and safe parking. Drainage shall be provided to dispose of all surface water without crossing sidewalks. b. Barriers/Bumpers: Except for parking areas provided for single-family and two-family units, suitable barriers or curbs shall be provided to protect sidewalks. Wheel or bumper guards shall be located so that no part of any vehicle shall extend beyond the parking area, intrude on pedestrian ways, or come in contact with walls, fences or plantings. As an alternative to requiring wheel stops, the Planning Commission may permit the widening of walks and landscaped areas to a minimum of six feet, where such widening will serve to protect walls, fences and landscaping in a substantially similar manner as wheel stops. Any increase in open space made necessary by the substitution of open space in lieu of wheel stops shall not be counted as open space in the calculation thereof for the project site, nor shall said areas be counted toward the minimum open space requirements for the zoning district in which the development is located. Areas of open space substituted for required wheel stops shall be identified on the site plan, and their cumulative area computed and noted on the site plan. c. Lighting: Lighting for off-street parking shall be adequate and so arranged as to direct the light away from any adjoining property in a residential district. Lighting shall conform with Section 5-22 of this Ordinance. d. Special rules for vehicle sales lots: All lots used to store and display vehicles for sale, including but not limited to new and used cars, trucks, recreational vehicles, trailers, campers, boats, motor homes, shall be improved in accordance with Section 5-15-(4) of this ordinance. All such lots shall also be required to provide perimeter landscaping in accordance with Section 5-15-6 (5) (Perimeter Landscaping) of this ordinance. e.

The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 131   Section 5-16. Off-street Loading Provisions Off-street loading facilities are required by this Ordinance so that vehicles engaged in unloading will not encroach on, or interfere with, the public use of streets and alleys and so that adequate space is available for the unloading and loading of goods, and materials. 5-16-1 Minimum Space Requirement Off-street loading spaces shall be provided and maintained as follows: a. Each retail store, storage warehouse, wholesale establishment, industrial plant, factory, freight terminal, market, restaurant, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning establishment, or similar use which has an aggregate floor area of:   15-16-2 Other Factors Determining Off-street Loading Requirements 1. Fractional Spaces: When determination of the number of spaces required by this Ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall require one space. 2. Enlarged/Changed Use: From the effective date of this Ordinance, if such land, structures, or uses are enlarged, expanded, or changed, there shall be provided for the increment only of such land, structures, and uses enlarged, expanded or changed and maintained as herein required, at least the amount of off-street loading space that would be required hereunder if the increment were a separate land, structure, or use. However, where a lot with an existing structure is cleared and a new structure constructed thereon, there shall be provided and maintained off-street loading space as required herein. 3. Joint Use: When an off-street loading space is used jointly by two or more uses with different requirements, or two or more uses having the same requirement, an area shall be provided equal to the total of requirements of all the uses. 5-16-3 Development of Off-street Loading Facilities 1. Plans: An applicant for a building permit must submit plans showing the off-street loading required by this Ordinance, for any use or structure required to provide off-street loading facilities. The plan shall accurately designate the required off-street loading spaces, access thereto, dimensions and clearance. Square feet Number of Spaces Over 5,000 to 25,000 1 25,000 to 60,000 2 60,000 to 120,000 3 120,000 to 200,000 4 200,000 to 290,000 5 90,000 over 290,000 1 additional off-street loading space Multi-Family Dwelling (20 or more dwelling units) 1 Auditorium, Convention Hall, Exhibition Hall, Motel, Hotel, Office, Building, Sports Arena, Stadium Hospital, Sanitarium, Welfare Institution, or similar Use with an aggregate floor area:  Over 10,000 to 40,000 1 Each additional 60,000 over 40,000 1  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 132   2. Size: Each space shall have clear horizontal dimensions of twelve (12) feet by thirty (30) feet exclusive of platforms and piers and a clear vertical dimension of fourteen (14) feet. Section 5-17. Airport Influence Area All land lying within the NEF 30 or higher noise contour as designated on the Official Zoning Map, City of Madison, is subject to special development regulations for the purpose of protection of the general health, safety and welfare of the public. In the case of any noise sensitive land uses within the NEF 30 or greater corridor, the potential buyer or builder shall be advised of the special requirements for development within this area as outlined in the Madison Subdivision Regulations. Section 5-18. Required Buffers (Ord. 96-02) The use of properly planted and maintained buffer areas may reduce and ease potential incompatibility between or among different uses of land in proximity to each other. 5-18-1 Requirements Landscaped buffers are required wherever two different zoning districts are adjacent to one another. The width of these buffers depends on the nature of the adjacency; that is, which two districts are adjacent to one another. The width requirements are enumerated in Section 5-18-5 below. In addition, buffers must meet the following requirements: 1. The landscaped buffer area shall not be less than the width specified in the Sec. 5-18-5 measured at right angles to property lines and shall be established along the entire length of and contiguous to the designated property line or lines. 2. The area shall be so designed, planted, and maintained as to be eighty (80) percent or more opaque between two (2) and six (6) feet above average ground level when viewed horizontally, unless otherwise specified in the appropriate district regulations. 3. Types and numbers of plantings for landscaped buffers shall be submitted with application for a building permit, along with plans and statements demonstrating how the buffer will be irrigated in the future. No building permit or site plan certificate shall be issued without such data, where this Ordinance requires a landscaped buffer area or areas. 4. Plantings shall be of a size and type which will insure the meeting of the eighty (80) percent opacity requirement within no longer than twelve (12) months of the date of first planting. Where questions may arise as to the suitability of proposed plant materials to meet this requirement, final determination of suitability shall be made by the Planning Commission. Eighty-percent opacity must be maintained year-round. 5. Failure to maintain the landscaped buffer area as set out above shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 5-18-2 Substitution for Landscaped Buffer Area When expressly authorized by the Planning Commission, a six (6) foot high opaque structure set in a five (5) foot wide landscaped buffer area may be substituted for the six (6) foot high, planted buffer in Subsection 5-18-1. 5-18-3 Exception to Requirement Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to require a landscaped buffer adjacent to a road depicted on the City’s Major Road Plan. In addition, the Planning Commission may, by majority vote, waive any buffering requirement with respect to lot lines adjacent to any public street. (ord. 98-02)  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 133   5-18-4 Zoning Determines Buffer Landscaped buffers shall be constructed by, and located on the lot zoned for the more intensive use. The Table in Section 5-18-5 below shall be used to determine which use is more intensive, with the least intensive uses on the left side of the horizontal axis of the Table, and the most intensive uses on the right side of the horizontal axis. In the case where an existing ""more intensive"" use adjoins a lower intensity district, but has not provided the required landscaped buffer, the less intensive use, when developed, may provide the buffer, at the option of the less intensive use. 5-18-5 Minimum Landscape Buffer Widths Minimum landscape buffer Widths shall be established according to the following table. Where district regulations in Chapter 4 of this Ordinance require a different buffer width, the requirements in Chapter 4 will control. All required buffers are in addition to yard requirements: Table 5-18-5 Minimum Required Buffers   Adjoining Use R1, R1A, R1B R2, R3A, RC-1, RC-2 R3 R4 B1 B2 B3, M1, M2 Proposed Use R1, R1A, R1B, R2 R3A, RC-1, RC-2 10 20 20 30 50 R3 10 10 20 30 40 R4 20 10 10 20 30 B1, B2/S1 20 20 10 20 20 30 B2 30 30 20 20 20 B3, M1, M2 50 40 30 30 20  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 134   Section 5-18A. Sidewalks (Ord. 97-50) 5-18A-1 Sidewalks Required At the time of site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall require the construction of 5 ft. wide concrete sidewalks along the adjacent public City street frontage for any project subject to the provisions of Section 5-2 of the zoning ordinance, unless a sidewalk exists at the time the site plan is approved. In the event that the project fronts on two streets depicted on the adopted Future Transportation Network Map in the Comprehensive Plan, sidewalks shall be provided on both streets. In the event that the project fronts on two streets, only one of which is depicted on the adopted Future Transportation Network Plan in the Comprehensive Plan, sidewalks shall be provided on the street so depicted, and, should the Planning Commission so require, also on the other street. Sidewalks shall be installed on public right-of-way. However, the Planning Commission shall in no case require the installation of sidewalks on State-owned right-of-way or along State Roads. When right-of-way is not available, the Planning Commission may require the installation of sidewalks in a sidewalk easement in the front yard on the site, in such location and configuration as to connect to existing or future sidewalks on adjacent parcels. However, sidewalks may not be installed in a front yard without the explicit approval of the Planning Commission. 5-18A-2 Waiver by Planning Commission 1. When the installation of sidewalks is, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, impractical, unjustifiable, or otherwise not in the public interest, the Planning Commission shall have the authority to waive this requirement. 2. Sidewalks shall not be required adjacent to parcels which are zoned M-1 or M-2. (ord. 98-74) 5-18A-3 Sidewalks in Buffer Areas Where the Planning Commission permits sidewalks or other walkways designed for pedestrian traffic to be placed within buffer areas required by Section 5-18 or any zoning district regulations, the width of the buffer will be increased 1 ft. for every foot of width of the sidewalk. The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 135   Section 5-19. Storm Water Management, Drainage, Erosion Control To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways shall remain undisturbed. Lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainage ways and topography. 5-19-1 Storm Water Management All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments. Specific requirements area:  1. No developments may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and  2. No development may be constructed or maintained so that surface waters from such development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower adjacent properties. 5-19-2 Drainage A. All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site. Surface waters shall not be regarded as unduly retained if:  1. The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately installed as part of an approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or 2. The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the development site in its predevelopment stage, unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety. B. No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer system. C. Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets. D. Use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter storm sewers in subdivisions is provided for in Subdivision Regulations of the City of Madison, Alabama. Private roads and access ways within unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction. E. Construction specifications for drainage swales, curbs and gutters, and storm drains shall be contained in the Subdivision Regulations. F. The City Engineer may require the detention or retention of stormwater on-site if necessary to meet Stormwater Management level of service standards adopted by the City. However, if capacity is available in the downstream drainage channels, the City Engineer may permit the drainage of the site into the existing system. In the event the site is drained into the existing system, the City Engineer may  The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 136   require the upgrading of downstream drainage improvements if necessary to maintain their predevelopment level of service. Attention is called to the Stormwater Management and Drainage standards and criteria found in the Public Improvements Manual. 5-19-3 Erosion and Sedimentation Control A. No zoning, special-use, or conditional-use permit may be issued and final approval for subdivision plats or certified plats may not be given with respect to any development that would cause land disturbing activity unless the professional engineer officially representing the developer certifies to the City that all necessary permits have been received from those agencies from which approval is required by state or federal law and that either:  1. An erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the City Engineer; or 2. The City Engineer has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it reasonably appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer of more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case, construction of the development may not begin, and no building permits may be issued, until the City Engineer approves the erosion control plan. B. For the purposes of this section, land disturbing activity means any use of the land by any person in residential, educational, institutional, commercial, or industrial development, and highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation. Sedimentation occurs whenever solid mineral or organic particulate matter is transported by water, ice, air, or gravity from the site of its origin. The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 137   Section 5-20. Alternative Energy Forms The use of solar energy collectors, storage facilities, distribution components, windmills, etc., for the purpose of providing energy for heating and/or cooling, is a Permitted Use within all zoning districts whether as a part of a structure or incidental to a group of structures. When not part of a structure, they are permitted in rear yards only. Section 5-21.

All fractions will be rounded to the closest integer number. c. For sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel, cabinet, or surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that encompasses the extreme limits of the background panel, cabinet, or surface. See Figure A and Figure B. d. For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted or painted on a building façade where there is no background panel, cabinet, or surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of the combination of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that encloses all the letters or elements associated with the sign. See Figure C. In cases where there are multiple sign elements on the same surface, the Planning Director shall have the authority to determine the outermost boundaries of individual sign elements. e. The calculation of sign area shall not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall unless such structural support is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign design by means of text or other commercial message, as determined by the Planning Director. See Figure A. Figure A: Illustration of sign area calculation for a monument sign with copy on a distinct cabinet. The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 152     Figure B: Example of sign area computation by the smallest circle encompassing the extreme limits of the sign message. For the purposes of calculations, equals 3.14. Figure C: Illustration of sign area calculation for two differently shaped wall signs with individual letters. The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 153    f. In the case of a three-dimensional sign where the sign faces are not mounted back-to-back, the sign area shall be calculated by the smallest square, rectangle or circle that encompasses the profile of the sign message. The profile used shall be the largest area of the sign message visible from any one point. See Figure D.  Figure D: The sign area of a three-dimensional sign is measured measuring the smallest square, rectangle, or circle that encompasses the profile of the sign (illustrated as sides). g. Except for three-dimensional signs, the sign area for a sign with more than one face (multi- faced signs) shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces when the interior angle is greater than 60 degrees. h. When two identical, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back or at angles of 60 degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the two faces are unequal, the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces. i. The calculation of the width or lineal measurement of any façade shall be the measurement of the façade between two side facades. The calculation shall be based on viewing the façade from a 90-degree angle (i.e., straight on), regardless of façade insets, offsets, or angles. See  Figure E.    Figure E: Illustration of façade width measurement on varied façade shapes. The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison Updated November 2, 2022 154    Section 7-6.
