10-4-4 Approval or Denial of a Special Exception   1.
In granting any Special Exception, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall issue a Special Exception   Permit and prescribe the appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this  Ordinance.

Section 10-5.
Variances     10-5-1 Purpose for Variances   It is expected that the granting of variances, an empowerment of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, will  be rare; however, a variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness,  shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary  and exceptional situations or conditions attributable to a piece of property, the strict application of any  regulation enacted under this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on  the owner of such property.
Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this  Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the  Zoning Board of Adjustment.
This shall include existing development sites proposed for expansion or  reconfiguration and which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance.
The site plan may  be reviewed concurrently and approved conditionally with review and action on the variance request,  but the site plan shall not be approved for development until the variance has been approved.
10-5-2 Procedures for Application for Variances   A Variance shall be processed by the Planning Department and granted by the Zoning Board of  Adjustment only in accordance with the following:   1.
Application and fee (See Chapter 16-2, Madison Code of Ordinances) for a Variance must be  submitted to the Planning Department thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing as required in  Section 10-2-3, Public Hearings.

10-5-3 Standards of Review for Variances   The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict application of the provision of this  Ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards are satisfied.
In general, the  power to authorize a variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall be sparingly exercised.
It is the  intent of this Ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition  of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using  the property as intended by the Zoning Ordinance.
Any variance granted shall be the minimum  adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical  difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted.
In particular, the applicant shall  establish and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and  standards listed below:   1.
The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the  regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall not be  injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
2.
The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use which is not permitted  in the district.
3.
There must be proof of unique circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings and  applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought, such circumstances or  conditions being peculiar to such land or buildings and generally having no application to land or  buildings in the district, and which circumstances or conditions are such that the strict  application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable  use of such land or building.
4.
There must be proof of unnecessary hardship.
It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that  greater profit would result if the variance were granted.
Furthermore, the hardship complained  of cannot be self-created nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases with or  without knowledge of the restrictions.
It must result from the application of this Ordinance; it     The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison  Updated November 2, 2022   188           must be suffered directly by the property in question; and evidence of other variances or non- conformities granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered.
5.
That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and  that the variance as requested from the Zoning Board of Adjustment is the minimum variance  that will accomplish this purpose.
6.
That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent  property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire,  endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the  adjacent neighborhood.
7.
That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege  that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of  the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
Section 10-6.

A temporary use and an accessory use shall require a zoning certificate as a precondition to their lawful  establishment.
The Planning Director may establish regulations governing the application requirements  for a zoning certificate in the case of either a temporary or accessory use that is established at any time  other than simultaneously with a principal use, in which case all information specified in this Section  shall be submitted.

In any case where an application is denied, the Planning Director shall state the specific reasons  and shall cite the specific chapters, articles, and sections of this Ordinance upon which denial is  based.
If relief of such denial would be available by special permit or variance, the Planning  Director shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the appropriate sections of this Ordinance.

PREAMBLE AND ENACTMENT CLAUSE      WHEREAS Chapter 52, Article 4 of Title 11 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended,   empowers the City of Clay to establish districts within its corporate limits for the purpose of   regulating the kind, character and use of structures and improvements within those zones, and to   provide for the administration, enforcement and amendment thereof; and,      WHEREAS the City Council of Clay deemed it necessary, for the purpose of promoting the   public health, safety, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare of the City to enact such   an ordinance, and appointed the Clay Planning Commission as the ""zoning commission"" to   recommend the boundaries of the various districts and the appropriate regulations to be enforced   therein; and,      WHEREAS the City Council had accordingly adopted such regulations and districts, as   recommended by the Planning Commission in December 2002, followed by a substantially   revised Ordinance and new districts recommended by the Planning Commission in March 2006;   and,      WHEREAS after ten years, during which there had been an unusually high number of   amendments to the 2006 Ordinance, the Clay City Council had determined that the revised   Ordinance contained too many errors, omissions, contradictions and redundancies; was too   cumbersome upon the City and its citizens; and, in fact, had proved counterproductive to the   City’s development goals and objectives; and,      WHEREAS the City Council directed that the Ordinance be revised again so as to be easier to   both understand and administer; to have a more practical overall application within the City; to   better reflect and address the specific character, conditions, needs, goals and development   objectives that are unique to the City of Clay, Alabama; and to be more compatible with   adjoining zoning jurisdictions across Clay’s municipal boundaries; and,      WHEREAS the City, with the assistance of a professional Planning Consultant, has prepared   such revision on behalf of the Planning Commission, which in turn has ratified the revised   Zoning Ordinance as complying with the City’s Comprehensive Plan requiring updates to its   development documents in order to stay current with what is occurring within City; and,      WHEREAS the Planning Commission, having given due public notice and held a hearing on the   revised Ordinance and accompanying zoning districts, and has submitted its final report to the   City Council; and,        7     WHEREAS the City Council has given due public notice of a second hearing related to the   adoption of a Zoning Ordinance setting forth the revised districts, regulations and restrictions,   and has held said public hearing thereon; and,      WHEREAS all requirements of Sections 77 and 79 of Title 11, Chapter 52, Article 4 of the Code   of Alabama, 1975, as amended, with regard to the preparation of the report by the Planning   Commission and subsequent action of the City Council have been met;      NOW, THEREFORE, the public welfare requiring it, the City Council of the City of Clay,   Alabama, does hereby ordain and enact

40     SECTION 905: R-P  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT      Planned Development Districts are intended to provide an optional method of land development   which invites imaginative proposals for unique and innovative design ideas.
Areas so established   shall be characterized by a unified building and site development program (approved through   and as part of the zoning) providing for coordinated open space and architectural treatment,   while at the same time providing the broadest possible flexibility in the design, types, and   densities of residential, commercial and institutional land uses, and especially in the mixing   thereof.
In addition, though application for R-P Planned Development zoning requires more information   up-front, there are great incentives for approaching a new development in this manner:      - Variable Dimensional Zoning Standards.
Except as otherwise provided herein,   standards for lot width, building height, floor area ratio, yard dimensions, off-street   parking and loading, landscaping and screening, fences, signs, and other standards   may vary from those established elsewhere in this Ordinance if such variations are   approved by the Planning Commission.
- Variable Subdivision Design Standards.
Dimensional and design standards for   subdivisions and subdivision improvements such as streets, blocks, sidewalks and   parkways (but excluding improvement construction standards) may vary from those   established in the City of Clay Subdivision Regulations.
- Mixed Land Uses.
Allows the mixing of different housing and land use types without   having to zone and plat each section separately and individually, and deal with any   unnecessary buffer and setback requirements between the districts.
- Progressive Development Staging.
The developer may submit plats in stages to the   Planning Commission if they are in substantial compliance with the approved plan.
905.1 Permitted Uses:      single family dwellings      duplexes or two-family dwellings      residential townhouses or townhomes      garden homes and patio homes     41        cottage and conservation subdivisions in accordance with Section 1202      group homes (permitted on appeal)      multi-family dwellings, apartments or condominiums      manufactured home park or subdivision in accordance with Section 1203      locally-oriented commercial businesses that are compatible with surrounding   residential development      recreational, religious or educational facilities normally desirable in an orderly    and attractive residential area         recreational vehicle park or campground      accessory buildings or structures customarily incidental to the above permitted    uses, and in accordance with Articles 10 and 11      other land uses or facilities as may be determined appropriate by the City through   the rezoning and Development Plan approval process      905.2 Area and Dimensional Requirements:      The minimum site area for a Planned Development District is five (5) acres.
905.3 Development Considerations and Guiding Principles:      a.
The Development Plan should, among other things, indicate the proposed   treatment of the following:      (1) Internal stability, safety, attractiveness, order and efficiency in the use of   land through the provision of adequate light, air and open space for   dwellings and other facilities, and through consideration for the proper   functional relationship of all dwellings, structures and/or uses within the   Planned Development District.
42     (2) The relationship of buildings and structures to the boundaries of the   Planned Development District; and to dedicated streets and private drives   within the District.
(3) The location and treatment of parking areas for all non-residential uses.
(4) General yard, setback and building separations within and between each   different use area and residential type.
*      *Even though a Development Plan is approved at the zoning level, a preliminary   subdivision plat showing specific yard sizes, setbacks, etc.
must still be submitted   for review and approval before any work can begin.
b.
Open Space is considered an integral component of all Planned Developments   approved under this zoning designation; and as such, open space should be   provided according to the following benchmarks:      - for developments containing 1 to 99 dwelling units, 200 sq.ft.
per unit.
- for developments containing 100 to 499 dwelling units, 220 sq.ft.
per unit.
- for developments containing 500 or more dwelling units, 230 sq.ft.
per unit.
c. Additional standards specific to Common Open Space (for all developments other   than Conservation Subdivisions) require not only that a Common Open Space or   network of such open spaces shall be provided; and that the Common Open Space   shall be protected in perpetuity on the recorded plat/record map and by a binding   legal document recorded with the deed as required in the Subdivision   Regulations; but that Common Open Spaces shall be located and arranged on the   site according to the following guidelines:       (1) No more than twenty-five (25%) percent of the required Common Open   Space should be unbuildable, whether due to existing steep grades or other   natural constraints or land disturbing activities.
Common Open Space   areas should be naturally of such condition or improved to a condition to   be suitable for the passive recreational use of the residents, including such   uses as trails, playgrounds, picnic areas, etc.
However, this guideline   should not be interpreted to require the removal of any existing trees or   other natural vegetation from Common Open Space areas.
(2) Common Open Spaces should be located and distributed throughout the   development to be accessible to the largest practicable number of lots.
43     Non-adjoining lots should be provided safe, convenient access to the Open   Space through trails, sidewalks or other pedestrian ways.
(3) Common Open Spaces should be located between the front, side, or rear of   opposing blocks, clusters, or lots and should not be located along the   perimeter of the site in such a manner as to be adjacent only to the rear of   dwelling units.
c. Additional Guiding Principles that should be considered in preparing a   Development Plan for approval under an R-P zoning classification include the   following:      (1) Inclusion of at least three different lot sizes or housing types in the   residential portion of the development.
(2) Varied architectural design features (such as roofline articulation, color,   and materials) and home placements that avoid the appearance of a long   row of identical homes.
(3) Internal streets should interconnect to the maximum extent practicable,   and “complete streets” are strongly encouraged throughout the   development.
(4) Pedestrian and bicycle routes running throughout the district, with   connections provided to existing or future adjoining development.
(5) Including appropriate street trees, sidewalks, and curb and gutter in all   street sections.
(6) Alternative storm water treatment methods are not only permitted, but   encouraged.
(7) Having distinct entry features, such as porches or weather-covered   entryways, on the houses.
(8) Facing all structures toward the street, minimizing setbacks and setting the   structures in proper proportion to their lot sizes.

1008.3 For a Privacy Fence, a solid wooden fence, six (6) feet in height, erected on the   interior of the property in question at least fifteen (15) feet from and parallel to   the property line(s) abutting the parcels that are to be screened.
The land area   between the privacy fence and the property line shall be grassed, landscaped or   otherwise maintained as a buffer strip or green belt, and both said grassed or   landscaped area and the fence shall be perpetually maintained structurally, as well   as kept neat and orderly in appearance, by the owner of the property.
Specifications for other types of fences and walls are set forth in the Clay Design   and Construction Specifications.
1008.4 For Screens, fences or walls shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high, and be   constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials, wood   posts and planks, or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing   materials, or any combination thereof.
No more than twenty-five (25) percent of   the fence surface shall be left open, and the finished side of the fence shall face   the abutting property.
Chain-link fencing, with or without plastic, metal, or wooden slats, shall not be   utilized for screening purposes; screening shall not compromise safety by   blocking vision at intersections or obstructing the visibility of vehicles entering or   leaving driveways; and it must not impede or divert the flow of water in any   drainage way.
Furthermore, in individual cases where either existing vegetation, a planted buffer   and/or a privacy fence is determined by the Zoning Officer to sufficiently obstruct   a particular area or facility from view, and therefore to satisfy the purpose and   intent of the required screen in question, said Officer may waive any requirement   of this Section for additional screening.
78     SECTION 1009   PLANTING AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS   FOR BUFFERS, LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING      In cases where a buffer strip, green belt, parking lot landscaping, screening or other planted or   landscaped area is required, the following requirements and standards shall apply (except where   higher requirements or standards may apply, including in – but not limited to – the Clay Design   and Construction Specifications).
1009.1  Planting Requirements.
a. Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least thirty (30) inches tall when planted   with an average height of five (5) to six (6) feet to be expected as normal   growth within four (4) years.
However, up to 25% of the required shrubs may be deciduous, and may be   two (2) feet tall when planted, provided an average height of three (3) to   four (4) feet is expected as normal growth within four (4) years.
b. Shrubs planted on a berm may be of a lesser height, provided the   combined height of the berms and plantings is a least six (6) feet after four   (4) years.
c. Existing mature tree growth on the site shall be preserved to the maximum   extent possible.
In some cases, such as uses locating on large, wooded lots,   preservation of substantial natural growth around the property perimeter   may be determined to be a sufficient buffer by the Zoning Officer (under   Section 1008.1 of this Ordinance).
d. In locations where the visual impact of a particular use or facility would   be minimal, such as remote agricultural/rural locations or developed heavy   industrial areas, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived   by the Clay Planning Commission.
1009.2  Maintenance.
a.
All required buffers and landscaping shall be maintained in perpetuity by   the property owner.
79     b.
Ground cover shall be regularly maintained as necessary to prevent   overgrowth during the spring and summer months, and all areas shall be   kept free of debris and refuse during all seasons.
c. Grass-type ground covers shall be kept in a healthy, controlled condition.
d. Existing natural vegetation used to meet buffer requirements may be   preserved in a natural state; however, upon a determination by the   Building Inspector that the condition of a buffer area constitutes a health   or safety hazard, such condition shall be remedied by the owner per the   recommendations of the Building Inspector.
SECTION 1010   BUILDING MATERIALS STANDARDS      Certain standards and specifications for building materials have been adopted by the City in   order to allow flexibility and variety in architectural style, design and function while maintaining   and promoting overall consistency of all of the buildings collectively in the City of Clay.
These   standards are contained in the Clay Design and Construction Specifications, and shall apply to all   structures – including accessory dwellings, whether attached to the principal dwelling or not –    permitted after the adoption of Ordinance No.
2006-07 on March 27, 2007.
Approval of building materials for remodeling or additions to any structures that existed prior to   that enactment shall be at the discretion of the Chief Building Inspector with the approval of the   City Council.

SECTION 1011   COMMUNICATION TOWERS      Communication towers may be erected within the City limits, in any zoning district, as deemed   appropriate by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
Communication towers, antennas, and similar   or related wireless communications facilities (excluding radio and television stations and towers   permitted in a P-U Public Utilities District) may be permitted in any zoning district upon appeal   to, and approval by, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and subject to such conditions as said     80     Board may require to preserve and protect the character of the district and surrounding   properties.
In considering each such appeal, the Board shall give due consideration to the following:    - lighting of the tower;   - visual impact;   - use compatibility;   - co-location alternatives, provisions, possibilities and/or other options;   - design options (e.g., use of existing structures, camouflage techniques, etc.
);   - safety and security.
Setbacks for communication tower facilities shall be those of the district in which said tower is to   be located; however, in no case shall tower facilities (including security fences) be located closer   than fifteen (15) feet to a residential or agricultural zoning district.
Further, the outermost fifteen   (15) feet (minimum) abutting any such residential or agricultural district shall be landscaped and   maintained as a buffer strip or green belt as set forth in Sections 1008 and 1009 of this   Ordinance.
SECTION 1012   LIMITATIONS, CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS    PERTAINING TO THE KEEPING OF ANIMALS      1012.1 No person shall keep or maintain, in connection with any residential dwelling   unit, more than three (3) dogs aged six (6) months or older, except in the A-G   Agriculture District.

Piles of feed or bedding shall be located no closer than fifty (50)   feet from a public street right-of-way line, lot line, or zoning   district boundary to minimize odor and nuisance problems.
Manure shall be stored for removal and disposed of in accord with   all applicable county, state, and federal regulations.
No manure   piles shall be located closer than fifty (50) feet from a public street   right-of-way, lot line, zoning district boundary, wetland,   watercourse, or other water body.
(2) Livestock Density Restrictions      The number of animals permitted in an R-R (Rural Residential)   district shall be determined by a system of ""animal unit   equivalents"" that shall be assigned to each individual animal as   follows:      horse = 1 unit   goat = 0.2 unit      swine = 1 unit   rabbit = 0.025 unit   cow = 0.5 unit   all fowl = 0.067 unit (each)       sheep = 0.5 unit                   Specific counts as to the number of animals allowable on a given   property can be determined by dividing the available acreage by     82     the unit equivalent in the chart above (e.g., 1 (acre) divided by   0.025 (rabbit units) equals 40 rabbits allowed).
Different animals   can be kept on the same property, provided the total cumulative   animal unit count does not exceed the maximum density of animals   set forth herein below.
Off-spring with the mother present shall be considered included in   the mother's unit until reaching breeding age.
Unit equivalents for other animals shall be defined by the Clay   Planning Commission.
And for the purpose of protecting the residential character of   development in these districts, a total of no more than two (2)   animal units (as determined by the preceding table and   computations above) shall be permitted on any one property; any   total number of units in excess of the two (2) units permitted herein   will require an A-G (Agricultural) zoning classification.

f. Legal Instrument for Protection of Open Space.
1.
The Open Space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal   instrument that is recorded with the deed.

a governmental entity with an interest in pursuing   goals compatible with the purposes of this ordinance.
If the entity accepting the easement is not the City, then a third   right of enforcement favoring the City shall be included in the   easement.
(B)  A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes   in favor of a governmental entity.
(C)  An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent   protection, if approved by the City.

On-street handicap parking spaces shall not be counted, nor shall any   on-street parking space be counted toward two or more uses.
1402.4 Parking Above the Maximum Number of Spaces.
Where a developer prefers to   provide “overflow” parking or parking spaces in excess of the maximum provided   herein, such as to meet intermittent high demands for parking (i.e.

114     SECTION 1403   REDUCED REQUIREMENTS FOR SHARED PARKING      In circumstances involving a combination of uses sharing a common parking area(s) for which   compliance with the conventional requirements of Section 1402 above might create total parking   in excess of actual need; or, wherever a use for which the highest parking demand occurs at a   different time from other uses on the same lot or block; such shall be determined and certified by   the Zoning Officer.
Upon such certification, the parking requirement for the combined uses may   be reduced in accordance with a recommendation by the Zoning Officer and as approved by the   Planning Commission, provided however that the following conditions as met.

115     ARTICLE 15   HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS      As the City recognizes the need to afford opportunities for residents to work from home, it is the   intent of this Section to establish regulations which will permit home occupations in a manner   that will preserve the peace, quiet and tranquility of residential neighborhoods, and to ensure the   compatibility of such uses with other uses permitted within the same zoning district.
Thus, home   occupations may be allowed as an incidental use, in conjunction with a single family residence,   but only in accordance with the regulations, restrictions, requirements and procedures of this   Article.
SECTION 1501   GENERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING HOME OCCUPATIONS      1501.1 General Restrictions.
The home occupation shall be clearly incidental to the   residential use of the dwelling, and shall not change the essential residential   character of the dwelling or the property on which it is located, nor shall it   adversely affect any of the uses permitted in the zoning district in which the   occupation is located.
No home occupations shall be permitted which might interfere with the general   welfare of the surrounding residential area due to potential noise, increased   pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic, or any other conditions that might be created   which would constitute an objectionable use of residentially zoned property.
1501.2 Limitation on Types of Home Occupations.
Home occupations should be   limited to an office or a business of a personal service nature.
However, the   Zoning Officer reserves the right to defer the determination of whether any   proposed home occupation meets this criteria to the Zoning Board of Adjustment   in cases where the nature and/or potential externalities of the proposed operation   are not entirely clear.
1501.3 Employment Limitations.
The person conducting the home occupation shall be a   full-time resident of the dwelling in which the home occupation is being   conducted.
Furthermore, employment for a home occupation purpose shall be   limited to members of the family residing in the dwelling; there shall be no   employment of help other than members of the residing family.
1501.4  Limitation on Area of a Home Occupation.
Use of the dwelling for a home   occupation purpose shall be limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of one (1) floor     116     of the principal building.
Use of one (1) accessory building for the home   occupation may be permitted provided that it be no larger than twenty-five   percent (25%) of the floor area of the principle building, and that such use does   not cause the elimination of the required off-street parking spaces for the   dwelling.
1501.5 External Alterations to Building.
No displays or changes in building facade,   including the dwelling and all accessory buildings, shall indicate from the exterior   that the dwelling is being utilized for any purposes other than a dwelling.
1501.6 Confinement to Building.
A home occupation shall be confined entirely to the   principle building and\or accessory building; no outside storage shall be allowed   in connection with a home occupation.
1501.7  Sale of Products.
No display of products shall be visible from the street.
Furthermore, except for non-durable articles (consumable products) that are   incidental to a service that is the principle operation in the home occupation, only   articles or goods lawfully made on the premises may be sold.
1501.8  Limitation on Students.
Instruction in music, dancing, art, crafts and similar   subjects shall be limited to two (2) students at any one time.
1501.9  Restriction on Hours of Operation.
Any activity of a home occupation that may   cause any kind of disruptive effect outside of the principle residence shall be   limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.      1501.10 Elements Prohibited in a Home Occupation.
A home occupation shall not   produce noise, obnoxious odors, vibrations, lighting glare, fumes, smoke, or   electrical interference detectable to normal sensory perception on any adjacent   lots or streets.
Neither shall any home occupation involve the use or storage of   explosive, highly combustible, or hazardous materials.
SECTION 1502   PROCEDURES FOR PERMITTING HOME OCCUPATIONS      1502.1 Administrative Approval.
Applications for home occupations that meet all of   the regulations and requirements of Section 1501 above may be approved by the   Zoning Officer.
However, said Officer shall have the discretion, where the   appropriateness of a proposed use as a home occupation may be in question as     117     relates to any of the elements of Section 1501, to require hearing and approval of   any such application by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
1502.2 Home Daycare as a Home Occupation.
Home daycares, as defined in Article 7   of this Ordinance, shall be considered conditional home occupations for the   purposes of this Ordinance, and shall accordingly be subject to approval by the   Zoning Board of Adjustment.
However, in recognition of the differences between   home daycares and other, more business-like types of home occupations,   regulation Items 4, 6, 8 and possibly 9 of Section 1501 above may be not be   applicable and/or may be relaxed to some extent with regard to a home daycare.
SECTION 1503   MONITORING, INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT   OF HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS      1503.1 Prior To Approval.
The review of any application for a home occupation may   include an inspection of the dwelling and property by the Zoning Officer and/or   Building Inspector prior to the issuance of any permit.
1503.2 Following Approval.
The Zoning Officer and/or Building Inspector, or their   respective designees, shall have the right to enter and inspect the property,   dwelling and/or accessory buildings for compliance purposes following advance   notice to the property owner.
1503.3 Permit Expiration and Renewal.
Home occupation permits shall expire one (1)   year from the date of issuance, and once granted may be renewed without   additional hearings provided there have been no reported issues and no changes in   the nature of the occupation.
118     ARTICLE 16   NON-CONFORMING USES      SECTION 1601   CONTINUANCE OF NON-CONFORMING USES   AND STRUCTURES      The lawful use of a structure or land existing at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance   (and subsequent amendments) may be continued although such use does not conform to the   provisions hereof.
If no structural alterations are made, a non-conforming use of a structure may   be changed to another non-conforming use of a more restrictive classification or to a conforming   use; however, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a use of a less restrictive classification.
For the purposes of this Article, a “use of a more restrictive classification” shall mean a use   generally more compatible with its surroundings and/or the district in which it located, and   otherwise of more limited impact to neighboring properties, including traffic, light, noise, odor,   etc.
This determination shall be made by the Zoning Officer.
SECTION 1602   DISCONTINUED NON-CONFORMING USES      1602.1 In the event a structure or premises occupied or utilized by a nonconforming use   that becomes discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months or longer, the   use of said structure or premises shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the   district in which it is located.
1602.2  In the event the use of a property, on which nonconforming signs exist, becomes   discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months or longer, such sign(s)   shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of Article 13 at the time of   re-use of the property.
SECTION 1603   STRUCTURAL EXTENSIONS AND ALTERATIONS      No structure or premises occupied by a non-conforming use shall be enlarged, extended,   reconstructed or otherwise structurally altered unless such use is changed to a use that conforms   to the use regulations of the district in which such structure or premises is located.
However, a   structure or premises occupied by a nonconforming use may be physically enlarged, extended,     119     reconstructed or structurally altered if and only to the extent necessary to be in compliance with   any existing and applicable law or ordinance specifying minimum standards for reason of health   or safety.
SECTION 1604   USE EXTENSIONS      No non-conforming use shall be enlarged, extended or expanded unless such use is changed to a   use which conforms to the use regulations of the zoning district in which such use is located.
SECTION 1605   NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR CONFORMING USES      A structure or building conforming to the use regulations of the district in which it is located but   not conforming to other provisions of this Ordinance may be enlarged, extended or expanded   provided that such enlargement, extension or expansion conforms to all regulations set forth in   that district and any other applicable regulations provided for in this Ordinance.
In cases where an existing building or structure does not conform to the area and dimensional   requirements, or other related provisions, of this Ordinance, said building or structure may be   enlarged, extended or expanded provided that such enlargement, extension or expansion   conforms to all regulations set forth in that district and any other applicable regulations provided   for in this Ordinance.
If such improvements or alterations do not conform to the applicable   regulations and requirements of this Ordinance, and/or do not bring the existing building or   structure into conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, a variance will be required prior   to issuance of a building permit for any enlargement, extension, expansion or similar structural   alterations.
SECTION 1606   DESTRUCTION OF A NON-CONFORMING USE      Any building or structure (occupied by a non-conforming use) that is damaged by explosion, fire,   act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its fair   market value immediately prior to said damage shall not be restored except in conformity with   the regulations of this Article.

SECTION 1702   BUILDING PERMIT      1702.1  Building Permit Required.

SECTION 1705   AMENDMENTS      The provisions of this Ordinance, including the Zoning Map, may from time to time be amended,   supplemented, changed, modified or repealed by the City Council in accordance with the   procedures stated herein.
SECTION 1706   PETITION TO AMEND:   REQUESTING CHANGES IN ZONING OR TO THIS ORDINANCE      1706.1 The Zoning Map and Ordinance shall only be amended after a recommendation   by the Commission and passage of an amendment by the City Council.

However, the Planning Commission shall not make a recommendation for   approval of any rezoning request that would be in conflict with the   Comprehensive Plan.
Should said Commission wish to consider such a rezoning,   it must first table the case pending hearing and adoption of any necessary   amendments to the Plan that would eliminate the conflict(s).
Failure to adopt such   amendment will necessarily require the Commission to recommend denial of the   rezoning in question.
1706.3  Petitions to amend this Ordinance and/or the Zoning Map may be initiated by:      a.
The owner of the land, or the owner's authorized agent in which case a   notarized letter to that effect is required, upon the filing of an application   with the Planning Commission; or,       b.
By the introduction of a resolution for such purpose by any member of the   City Council.

The Planning Commission   shall have seventy (70) days after the public hearing in which to make   recommendations to the City Council.
The recommendations of the Planning   Commission shall be advisory only, and shall not be binding on the City Council.

125        1707.3 Planning Commission Review Required.

1707.5 Expiration.
In any case where construction, alteration or use of a building,   structure or land has not been initiated within one year from the date of the   Council’s approval of a rezoning application, such property shall revert to the   zoning classification held prior to rezoning; the property owner or other   designated representative shall be required to file a new petition/application for   rezoning in order to continue with the project.
Provided, however, that the Council may waive such expiration in any case where   sufficient evidence is presented that a good faith effort has been made by the   applicant to proceed with the project originally approved.
Evidence must show   that the delay resulted from circumstances beyond the control of the Applicant.
SECTION 1708   NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING      No changes in or amendments to the provisions of this Ordinance shall become effective until   after a public hearing in relation thereto, and at which interested parties and citizens shall have   an opportunity to be heard.

However, whenever the Commission fails to reach a decision on an application,   for which notice of the originally scheduled Council hearing on the same case has   already been given, a new notice shall be provided to the affected property owners   with the rescheduled date of the Council Hearing.
SECTION 1709   TIME LIMIT      After the City Council has voted on a petition/application for an amendment to this Ordinance   and/or the Zoning Map, another petition/application for the same kind of rezoning of the same   tract or parcel of land, or for the same change of the same portion of the Zoning Ordinance, will   not be considered until a period of one (1) year has elapsed from the date of such action by the   City Council.
Furthermore, the withdrawal of a petition/application to amend this Ordinance or the Zoning   Map after the hearing held by the Planning Commission but prior to hearing by the City Council   shall also require a one (1) year period of time before another application of the same nature may   be submitted.
Be it further provided with regard to this Section, however, that the Planning Commission may   adjust this time period if, in the opinion of the majority of said Commission, an usual situation or   circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing prior to expiration of the one (1) year   period stipulated herein.
Such circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, the   following and any combination thereof:      a. change in ownership of the applicable property;      b. provision of utilities, public services or public improvements not available at the   time of the original request;      c. rezoning of adjacent properties which would tend to support the original request;      d. amendments to this Ordinance or the Comprehensive Plan which would tend to   support the original request.

Each and every day during which such violation continues shall be   deemed a separate offense.
Conviction of a violation and imposition of any fine   shall not constitute an exemption from compliance with the regulations and other   provisions of this Ordinance.
1711.4  Further Provisions.
In any case of violation of this Ordinance as set forth herein,   any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be damaged or caused   hardship by such violation, may institute injunction, mandamus or other   appropriate action or proceeding to stay or prevent such unlawful erection,   construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, or   to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent occupancy of, such building,   structure or land.

1802.1  Powers in General.
In exercising the powers set forth in this section, the Zoning   Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm in whole or in part, or may modify the   order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from.
Said Board may   subsequently make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to   be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer or official from   whom the appeal is taken.
1802.2  Administrative Review.
The Board shall have the authority to hear and decide   appeals where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement, decision or   determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this   Ordinance or amendment thereto.
In exercising the power of Administrative   Review, the Board must apply and not vary the terms of this Ordinance.
Such   appeals may include the following:      a.
Hear and decide upon requests for the interpretation of the provisions of   this Ordinance;      b.
Determine the precise location of boundary lines between zoning districts   when there is dissatisfaction with a decision regarding said subject made   by an administrative official; or,      c.  Classify a use which is not specifically mentioned within the Ordinance,   for the purpose of determining the permissiveness of such use in any   zoning district.
1802.3  Special Exceptions.
Within this Ordinance, there are exceptions to the permitted   uses of land listed in certain zoning districts, such as conditional uses and uses   that are permitted on appeal.
The term ""special exception"" shall also apply to and   include incidental uses, and may be applicable to certain accessory uses or   structures as well.
In these situations, the Zoning Board of Adjustment is   specifically authorized to:      a.
Hear and decide such special exceptions;     132        b.
Decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special   exceptions should be granted; and,      c.  Ensure that special exceptions are granted only when they conform to the   spirit and intent of this Ordinance.
In exercising this power regarding Special Exceptions, the Board shall follow the   language of this Ordinance exactly, and shall make certain that all the conditions   specified in this Ordinance have been met.
Furthermore, the Board may compel   the applicant to meet any additional requirements which the Board deems   necessary to protect surrounding neighborhoods from undue congestion,   excessive light and/or noise, odors, and other impacts which might otherwise be   incurred by the exception.
1802.4 Variances.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize, upon appeal in   specific cases, such variances from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be   contrary to the public interest and, where owing to special conditions, a literal   enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in unnecessary   hardship, and so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed and substantial   justice done.
Before any variance is granted, however, the Board shall consider the following   guidelines and, upon finding that the conditions outlined below do, in fact, exist,   may grant such variance:      a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions which are peculiar to   the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or   topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same   district.
b.
Granting the requested variance will not confer upon the applicant any   special privileges that are denied to other residents of the district in which   the property is located.
c.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive   the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district   in which the property is located.
133     d.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of   this Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the   general welfare.
e.  The special circumstances causing the alleged need for the variance are   not the intended result of actions of the applicant (i.e., self-imposed   hardship).
f.  The requested variance is the minimum variance that will make the legal   use of the land, building or structure possible.
g.  The variance will not allow the permanent establishment of a use that is   not permissible in the district involved under the terms of this Ordinance,   nor any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this   Ordinance in said district.
Furthermore, in contrast to the conditions warranting a variance outlined above,   the Board shall not consider the following as grounds for the issuance of a   variance:      a.
The non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in   the same district, or the permitted or non-conforming use of lands,   structures or buildings in other districts shall not be considered grounds   for a variance.
b.
Proof that a variance would increase the financial return from the land will   not be considered pertinent to the determination of a hardship.
c.  Neither a personal hardship nor a self-imposed hardship will be considered   grounds for a variance.
In no case shall the Zoning Board of Adjustment grant a variance that:      a.
Would permit the permanent use of land, building(s) or structure(s) for a   use prohibited within the district in which the land, building(s) or   structure(s) is located; or,      b.
Would permit the extension or addition of a non-conforming use; or,      c.  Would in any way make a non-conforming use more permanent.
134        1802.5  Validity and Applicability of Variances and Special Exceptions.
Any variance   or special exception granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, in addition to   any other relevant provisions of this Section, shall be applicable only to the land   or property involved, and shall be valid only for the applicant having appealed for   such variance or special exception unless otherwise determined and/or designated   by the Board.
SECTION 1803   APPEALS FROM ACTIONS OF THE ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT      Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment may,   within fifteen (I5) days after said judgment or decision, appeal therefrom to the circuit court (or   court of like jurisdiction) by filing with the Board a written notice of appeal specifying the   judgment or decision from which the appeal is taken.
In the case of such appeal, the Board shall   cause a transcript of the proceedings in the action to be certified to the court to which the appeal   is taken, and the action in such court shall be tried de novo.
135     ARTICLE 19   FEES      The Council shall, from time to time, establish or modify fees for the following procedures,   permits, and/or applications required by this Ordinance, the Subdivision Regulations and/or the   Design and Construction Specifications, and shall do so under a separate municipal ordinance.

181 | P a g e      7-6 RHC Roosevelt Highway Corridor Overlay District     A.
Description of District.
The Roosevelt Highway Corridor is a 15-mile portion of   Roosevelt Highway (US 29) from the Fulton County line in Palmetto to Camp Creek  Parkway in College Park.
The corridor spans several governing jurisdictions, and  includes portions of the City of Palmetto, the City of Fairburn, the City of Union  City, the City of College Park, the Red Oak Community and unincorporated Fulton  County.
Through architectural form, landscape, hardscape, signage and graphics, this  Overlay District seeks to reflect the history of the highway corridor, to  accommodate modes of transportation other than the automobile such as  bicycling, walking and transit through pedestrian oriented street design and  circulation patterns and to improve the aesthetics of the corridor.
The purpose and intent of the Roosevelt Highway Corridor Overlay District is to  unify the Corridor with aesthetic design elements while protecting the  separateness and individualities of the communities of Palmetto, Union City, Red  Oak and College Park.
Moreover, this district seeks to maintain Roosevelt  Highway’s function as a viable transportation facility that is not encumbered by  endless commercial sprawl.
This is accomplished by segmenting the corridor  within each community into three Development Districts: Core, Primary and  Secondary Development Districts, which are defined below.
The Core Development District (CDD) allows for the development of a pedestrian  oriented commercial village center with a mix of uses for residents to live, work  and relax.
The Core District includes residential uses combined with retail, service  commercial, office and institutional uses in the same buildings.
The Core District  supports and promotes commercial vitality and is a pedestrian oriented  environment.
Road frontage encourages vehicles to slow down and streetscape  features are designed for traffic calming and pedestrian safety.
Preservation of the  existing historical character of the area is critical in the Core District.
The Primary Development District (PDD) occurs outside the Core District and  transitions the more highly developed Core to a more automobile friendly  concept.
A mix of commercial, residential and community uses inhabit the less  densely developed Primary District but are not permitted to be mixed into the  same structure.
Pedestrian use is not as high in this district, and road frontage is  geared to pedestrian safety.
The Primary District promotes a unified architectural  style in terms of density, spacing and massing of buildings.
The Secondary Development District (SDD) is the parkway that links the Primary  Districts and serves to protect rural land and natural resources of the Roosevelt  Highway Corridor.
The secondary District is even more automobile and truck  oriented and generally limited to industrial and corporate complexes with natural        182 | P a g e      barriers screening the development off each side of the road.
While pedestrian use  is lower here, road frontage continues to address safety associated with transit and  school bus activities.
This Overlay is adopted for the purpose of advancing community development  goals, promoting economic development and promoting and protecting health,  safety, order, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of Union City, Georgia.
B.
General Requirements.
The 15-mile Roosevelt Highway Corridor is a multi   jurisdictional corridor and includes portions of the City of Palmetto, the City of  Union City, The City of College Park, the Red Oak Community and unincorporated  Fulton County between the Fulton/Coweta County line and Camp Creek Parkway.

In the Primary and Secondary Districts, only parcels  fronting Roosevelt Highway shall comply with the regulations.
Whenever provisions of this section conflict with any other article or section in the  Zoning Ordinance of the City of Union City or any other City ordinances,  regulations or resolutions, these standards shall prevail.
C.   Permitted Uses.
The Core Development District (CDD) shall utilize the Mixed-Use  District (MXD) regulations of the City of Union City Code.
The MXD District is  intended to integrate work places, shopping, entertainment services, and housing  and community facilities in a pedestrian friendly, village-like environment.
Where  provisions of the Mixed-Use District conflict with any articles of this resolution, the  provisions of this article and guidelines detailed in the Design Guidelines for the  Roosevelt Highway Corridor shall prevail.
The Primary Development District (PDD) and the Secondary Development District             (SDD) shall be comprised of land uses designated by The City of Union City and   zoned accordingly, but shall be in compliance with the regulations of this overlay  district and shall comply with guidelines detailed in the Design Guidelines for the  Roosevelt Highway Corridor.

Any such  towers or antennas that fail to meet the requirements of this Ordinance shall  be referred to in this Ordinance as “grandfathered towers” or “grandfathered  antennas”.
8-2 General Guidelines and Requirements.
A.
Purpose and Goals.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish guidelines for  the siting of towers and antennas.
The goals of this Ordinance are to:       1.
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to   provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently;    2.
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;    3.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent   possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;    4.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that   minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and,        199 | P a g e        5.
Discourage, specifically, the location of towers in residential areas and,   generally, the proliferation of towers throughout the community.
B.
Principal or Accessory Use.
Antennas and towers may be considered either  principal or accessory uses.
A different existing use or an existing structure on  the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such  lot.
For purposes of determining whether the installation of tower or antenna  complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to  setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements and other such  requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the  antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
C. Inventory of Existing Sites.
Each applicant for an administrative approval or a  special use permit shall provide the Planning and Zoning Department with an  inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the  location, height and design of each tower.
The Planning and Zoning  Department may share such information with other applicants applying for  administrative appeals or special use permits under this Ordinance or other  organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City.
D. Aesthetics and Lighting.
The guidelines set forth in 8-3.D shall govern the  location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this  Ordinance; provided, that the City may waive these requirements if, in its sole  discretion, it determines that the goals of this Ordinance are better served  thereby.
1.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any   applicable standards of the FAA, be painted sky blue or gray, so as to  reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to   the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and  landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and  built environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and   supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color  that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting  structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually  unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other   applicable authority.
If lighting is required, the Council may review the  available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the  least disturbance to the surrounding views.
200 | P a g e      E.  Federal Requirements.
All towers must meet or exceed current standards and  regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal  government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If such  standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and  antennas governed by this Ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas  into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6)  months of the effective date of such standards and regulations.
Failure to  bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and  regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at  the owner’s expense.
F.  Building Codes; Safety Standards.
To ensure the structural integrity of towers,   the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with  standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable  standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries  Association, as amended from time to time.
If, upon inspection, the City  inspection department concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes  and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon  notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days  to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards.
If the  owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the  governing authority may remove such tower at the owner’s expense.

9-4 Standards of Tree Preservation and Replacement     A.
Tree Preservation.
1.
It shall be the policy of the City of Union City that preserving existing native  species of trees is preferred to replacing them with newly planted trees.
Tree removal may be disallowed where reasonable accommodations can  be made to alter the proposed project to save significant trees and such        210 | P a g e      accommodation has not been made in the grading plan, site plan, or  building plan.
2.
Specimen trees shall be preserved wherever feasible except for trees that   are diseased, structurally unsound, or damaged to such a degree that they  are unlikely to survive and may pose a threat to human safety or cause  serious property damage.
3.
Specimen trees that are in good health and condition shall not be removed   from any proposed right of way or from the protected area of any private  property without approval from the City Engineer.
The City Engineer may  authorize removal of a healthy, sound specimen tree only if he or she finds  the location of the tree is clearly within the buildable area of the lot or  street right-of-way and the relocation of necessary permanent buildings or  site improvements to save the tree would not be feasible.
Removal of any  other specimen tree from private property shall be prohibited.
4.
Tree removal shall be disallowed if severe soil erosion or runoff problems   will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to flood plain or stream  buffer, and the removal will substantially alter the existing soils and  increase runoff and erosion.
5.
Trees shall not be removed from the floodplain, except as follows:     a.
Trees found to be diseased or insect infested by the Zoning   Administrator, County Extension Service, the Georgia Forestry  Commission, an Arborist, or a Registered Forester; or     b.

Such trees may be  counted toward tree density requirements.
5.
Alternative compliance.
Where the City Engineer determines that   minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints, the  number of trees to be planted on a site or lot shall be determined by the  City Engineer based on site review.
Thereafter, the owner/ developer/  builder shall, with the concurrence of the City Engineer, provide the  remaining balance of required trees to be planted on City property,  including rights of way of existing streets.

The City then will obtain prices  from a minimum of two (2) Plant Nurseries and/ or Landscape contractors,  selected by the City to supply and plant the required plant materials.
Prior  to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, an amount equal to the lower  of the bid prices will be paid by the owner/ developer/ builder to the City.
The City, at its option, may elect to proceed to have planting done on City  land or right of way or to hold these funds until more suitable planting  conditions prevail.
Upon payment, the owner/ developer/ builder will be  relieved of any further responsibility for the fulfillment of these  requirement for the subject property.
212 | P a g e        6.

1. Who May Appeal.
Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved   or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the governing authority  affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator.
Such appeals shall be  filed no later than 30 days after the date of notification of the decision  appealed from the filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a  notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.
The Zoning Administrator  shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record  upon which the action appealed from was taken.
2.
Legal Proceedings Stayed.
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance   of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the  Board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his  opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.
In such a case, proceedings  shall not be stayed otherwise than by restraining order which may be granted  by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning  Administrator, and on due cause shown.
3.
Extent of Board of Appeals Power.
The Board may, in conformity with the  provisions of these regulations, reverse or affirm the requirement, decision or  determination of the Zoning Administrator.
The Board may direct the issuance  of a permit.
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to carry out the  decisions of the Board.
B.
Request for a Variance.
The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases   such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the  public interest where, owing the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the  provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical  difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be  observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done;  provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or  building or structure that is prohibited by this Ordinance in the District in question.
A variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the Board that  the following exists:     1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular   piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography;     2.
The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would  create a practical difficulty of unnecessary hardship;        242 | P a g e        3.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;     4.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or   impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided, however, no  variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is  prohibited by this Ordinance;     5.
A literal interpretation of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of any  rights that others in the same District are allowed; and,     6.
Provided that the Board may impose or require such additional restrictions and  standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and  residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the  general neighborhoods; and provided that wherever the Board shall find, in the  case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that  any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was  granted are not being complied with, said Board shall rescind and revoke such  permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full  opportunity for a hearing.
In exercising the above powers, the Board shall not  consider any non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures of buildings  in the same District, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in  other Districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance.
D.  Request for Extension or Enlargement of the Nonconforming Use of a Structure.
The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension of an existing  non-conforming use which the Board is specifically authorized to pass on under  the terms of this Ordinance.
Said extension may be granted in an individual case  upon a finding by the Board that:  1.
The use is a non-conformance as defined in these regulations;     2.
The use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations   applicable to non-conformances; and,     3.
The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent  property in the same District.
E.  Continuance of Nonconformance.
The Board may allow a non-conformance to be   reestablished after discontinuance for 12 consecutive months where it is deemed  by the Board that;    1.
The design, construction and character of the land, building or structure is not   suitable for uses permitted in the District in which the non-conformance is  situated;     2.
Undue hardships to the property owner would result in not allowing the  continuance of a non-conformance;        243 | P a g e        3.
Adjacent property would not be unduly damaged by such continuance; and,     4.
The use is to be identical to the prior non-conformance.
F. Compliance with Standards.
Where and application to the Board is initiated due to   an existing violation of the Ordinance and said application is denied, the violation  shall be required to be corrected within 10 days of such denial or as specified by  the Board if a greater time period is necessary.
The maximum extension of the  time shall not exceed 30 days.
G. Forms.
Forms shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator for the Board, and the  appellant shall pay the Zoning Administrator for expenses incidental to the appeal.
No form shall be accepted by the Zoning Administrator unless it contains all  pertinent information and is accompanied by the required fee to defray expenses.

For the purposes of this Ordinance, the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia is divided into zoning   districts designated as follows:   AF Agricultural-Forest District provides for agriculture, forestry, very low   density residential development, and limited other uses under specific   conditions.
RS-200 Low Density Single-Family Residential District provides for twenty   thousand (20,000) square foot minimum lot sizes.
RS-175 Low Density Single-Family Residential District provides for seventeen   thousand five hundred (17,500) square foot minimum lot sizes.

The three (3) Low Density Single-Family Residential Districts include   existing low density residential areas and vacant or open areas where   similar residential development is appropriate.
The regulations for these   districts are designed to encourage low density one-family residential   development, protected from the depreciating effects of small lot   development and excessive density.
RS-100 Medium Density Single-Family Residential District provides for ten   thousand (10,000) square foot minimum lot sizes.
This district includes   areas of medium density residential development.
The regulations for this   district are designed to take advantage of the greater economy and   convenience afforded by more intensive development but still retain some   of the open aspects of a detached dwelling unit district.
RS-72 Medium Density Single-Family Residential District provides for seven   thousand two hundred (7,200) square foot minimum lot sizes.
This district   includes areas of medium density residential development.
The regulations   for this district are designed to encourage more compact development in   appropriate transitional areas particularly between existing residential and   non-residential development.

The regulations for this district are designed to   provide an area where individuals and families may establish homes in an   environment which satisfies their needs for convenience and economy.
This zoning district is to be located where public water supply and waste   water treatment facilities are available or can be obtained and where there   is convenient access to collector streets, major thoroughfares or state or   interstate highways.
The purpose of this district is to promote more   efficient utilization of land and creativity in architectural and engineering   design favoring traditional neighborhood design principles without   maximizing density.
OI Office-Institutional District provides for limited commercial and   institutional land uses where traffic, noise and congestion are minimized.
This district is established to provide a location for offices, institutions and   limited related retail business and service activities in buildings of high   character in attractive surroundings.

HSB Highway Service Business District provides for limited uses of   commercial land adjacent to major traffic arteries.
Established to provide   locations for retail trade establishments compatible with surrounding   residential and office-institutional areas, and for business activities which   primarily cater to the traveling public.

BG General Business District provides for a wide range of retail land service   establishments in a central business environment.

Architectural and Design Standards.
A.
COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, OFFICE, INSTITUTIONAL, MANUFACTURING and MULTI-FAMILY DESIGN   STANDARDS   1.
Objectives and Findings   In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within the City of Sugar Hill, the   City hereby adopts the following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed buildings within RM,   OI, HSB, BG, LM, HM-1 and HM-2 zoning districts.
These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect   and livability of the entire city.
These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest, yet achieve and   maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality.
Each building should be created as an enduring feature of the City’s built and natural environment contributing   to the productivity of our economy, social/civic network and ecological condition.
The use of quality local   materials is encouraged in order to minimize the operational and environmental cost over the life of each   building.
A typical building exterior shall require little maintenance and achieve a life span of at least 80 years.
Nostalgic replications of any building shall be avoided.
The use of building materials should create a consistent and traditional architectural identity for each   building/development.
Traditional architecture may include the use of brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage   and subdued colors.
For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth shall be   provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy and reduce the perceived scale of such a building.
2.
Grandfathering and Adoption   The following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed non-residential or         multifamily   buildings within RM, OI, HSB, BG, LM, HM-1 and HM-2 zoning districts.
Any project within the City that has   received or applied for a building permit by the date of adoption of these requirements shall be allowed to   proceed under the previous requirements.
In addition to applicable provisions outlined in Article VIII of the   2000 Zoning Ordinance relating to nonconforming uses, any building addition or enlargement to a lawfully   constructed building shall not be subject to these requirements.

Building Plans   All building plans submitted as an application for a building permit should clearly indicate all of the proposed   building materials and colors for each facade as described herein.
The plans should clearly show the location,   dimensions and calculate the amount/percentages of all building materials per facade.
The following design standards are primarily based upon the City’s zoning categories.
However if a use is   permitted in a more intensive zoning district, building material allocations shall be used for the less intensive   classification (e.g.
a professional office in a  BG zoning district shall use the building material allocations in Table   I for OI categories.)

d. Facade Calculations   With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building   materials used.
When a material is restricted as a percentage in Table I or Table II, such as stucco or   siding, the building material may not be considered a primary building material or be combined with   another restricted building material.
The allowed facade materials shall not apply to windows, glass-  front windows, entry doors and/or roll-up doors.
The amount of permitted material shall be calculated   using the gross square footage of wall area per facade.
A building material that is allowed (such as brick)   may be used in any percentage throughout the structure.
A material that is restricted (such as stucco   and split face block) is allowed as a maximum percentage.
For example, a building has a front facade   with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors.
Begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations.
In this case, the front facade of   a building in BG zoning district with a wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 300 square   feet of stucco on the front facade [ex.
(1,200 X 25% = 300)].
