A sign structure that has ceased to be used, and the owner intends no longer to have used, for the display of sign copy, or as otherwise defined by state law. ANIMATED SIGN. A sign employing actual motion or the illusion of motion. Animated signs, which are differentiated from changeable signs as defined and regulated by this code, include the following types: Electrically activated. Animated signs producing the illu- sion of movement by means of electronic, electrical or electro-mechanical input and/or illumination capable of simulating movement through employment of the charac- teristics of one or both of the classifications noted below: 1. Flashing. Animated signs or animated portions of signs whose illumination is characterized by a repet- itive cycle in which the period of illumination is either the same as or less than the period of nonillu- mination. For the purposes of this ordinance, flash- ing will not be defined as occurring if the cyclical period between on-off phases of illumination exceeds 4 seconds. 2. Patterned illusionary movement. Animated signs or animated portions of signs whose illumination is characterized by simulated movement through alter- nate or sequential activation of various illuminated elements for the purpose of producing repetitive light patterns designed to appear in some form of constant motion. Environmentally activated. Animated signs or devices motivated by wind, thermal changes or other natural envi- ronmental input. Includes spinners, pinwheels, pennant strings, and/or other devices or displays that respond to naturally occurring external motivation. Mechanically activated. Animated signs characterized by repetitive motion and/or rotation activated by a mechani- cal system powered by electric motors or other mechani- cally induced means. ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTION. Any projection that is not intended for occupancy and that extends beyond the face of an exterior wall of a building, but that does not 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” include signs as defined herein.

A multisided overhead structure or architectural projection supported by attachments to a build- ing on one or more sides and either cantilevered from such building or also supported by columns at additional points. The surface(s) and/or soffit of an attached canopy may be illuminated by means of internal or external sources of light. See also “Marquee.” CANOPY (Free-standing). A multisided overhead structure supported by columns, but not enclosed by walls.

A sign affixed to the visible surface(s) of an attached or free-standing canopy. For reference, see Sec- tion 1003. CHANGEABLE SIGN. A sign with the capability of con- tent change by means of manual or remote input, including signs which are: Electrically activated. Changeable sign whose message copy or content can be changed by means of remote elec- trically energized on-off switching combinations of alpha- betic or pictographic components arranged on a display surface. Illumination may be integral to the components, such as characterized by lamps or other light-emitting devices; or it may be from an external light source"
