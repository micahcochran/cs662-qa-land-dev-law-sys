Planned unit developments (PUDs) shall be allowed by planning commission approval in any zoning district. No such planned unit development permit shall be granted unless such development will meet the use limita- tions of the zoning district in which it is located and meet the density and other limitations of such districts, except as such requirements may be lawfully modified as provided by this code. Compliance with the regulations of this code in no way excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of a subdivision ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the approval of the application for the planned unit development. 1301.2 Intent. These regulations are to encourage and pro- vide means for effecting desirable and quality development by permitting greater flexibility and design freedom than that permitted under the basic district regulations, and to accom- plish a well-balanced, aesthetically satisfying city and eco- nomically desirable development of building sites within a PUD. These regulations are established to permit latitude in the development of the building site if such development is found to be in accordance with the purpose, spirit and intent of this ordinance and is found not to be hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment, property values or the character of the neighborhood or the health, safety and welfare of the community. It is intended to permit and encourage diversification, variation and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures for developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic develop- ment with relationship to public services, and to encourage and facilitate the preservation of open lands. SECTION 1302 CONDITIONS 1302.1 Area. No planned unit development shall have an area less than that approved by the planning commission as ade- quate for the proposed development. 1302.2 Uses. A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted in the zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of zoning district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a permitted use in a planned unit development, which allows residential uses and shall be governed by density, design and other requirements of the planned unit development permit. Where a site is situated in more than one use district, the permitted uses applicable to such property in one district may be extended into the adjacent use district. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” 1302.3 Ownership. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property. 1302.4 Design. The planning commission shall require such arrangements of structures and open spaces within the site development plan as necessary to ensure that adjacent proper- ties will not be adversely affected. 1302.4.1 Density. Density of land use shall in no case be more than 15 percent higher than allowed in the zoning district. 1302.4.2 Arrangement. Where feasible, the least height and density of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of the development. 1302.4.3 Specific regulations. Lot area, width, yard, height, density and coverage regulations shall be deter- mined by approval of the site development plan. 1302.5 Open spaces. Preservation, maintenance and owner- ship of required open spaces within the development shall be accomplished by either: 1. Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway sys- tem; or 2. Creating a permanent, open space easement on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of an owners’ association established with articles of asso- ciation and bylaws, which are satisfactory to the legis- lative body. 1302.6 Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the uses within the site and as a means of integrat- ing the proposed development into its surroundings shall be planned and presented to the planning commission for approval, together with other required plans for the develop- ment. A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings shall be prepared for the entire site to be developed. A grading and drainage plan shall also be submitted to the planning commission with the application. 1302.7 Signs. The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the intensity and direction of area or floodlighting shall be detailed in the application. 1302.8 Desirability. The proposed use of the particular loca- tion shall be shown as necessary or desirable, to provide a service or facility that will contribute to the general well being of the surrounding area. It shall also be shown that under the circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the planned unit development. 49  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SECTION 1303 PLANNING COMMISSION DETERMINATION 1303.1 Considerations. In carrying out the intent of this sec- tion, the planning commission shall consider the following principles: 1. It is the intent of this section that site and building plans for a PUD shall be prepared by a designer or team of designers having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in the application. The commis- sion shall be permitted to require the applicant to engage such professional expertise as a qualified designer or design team."
