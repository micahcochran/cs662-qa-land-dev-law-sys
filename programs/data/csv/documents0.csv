Introduction Development Adoption PREFACE Internationally, code officials recognize the need for consistent and uniform zoning ordinances. The International Zoning Code®, in this 2012 edition, is designed to meet this need through model code regulations that safeguard the public health and safety in all communities, large and small. This comprehensive zoning code establishes minimum regulations for zoning ordinances. This 2012 edition is fully compatible with all of the International Codes® (I-Codes®) published by the International Code Council (ICC)®, including the international Building Code®, international Energy Conservation Code®, International Existing Building Code®, International Fire Code®, international Fuel Gas Code®, International Green Construction Code™ (to be available March 2012), international Mechanical Code®, ICC Performance Code®, International Plumbing Code®, International Private Sewage Disposal Code®, international Property Maintenance Code®, International Residential Code®, International Swimming Pool and Spa Code™ (to be available March 2012), and International Wildland-Urban interface Code®. The International Zoning Code provides many benefits, among which is the model code develop- ment process that offers an international forum for code officials and other interested parties to discuss performance and prescriptive code requirements. This forum provides an excellent arena to debate proposed revisions. This model code also encourages international consistency in the appli- cation of provisions. The first edition of the International Zoning Code (1998) was the culmination of an effort initiated in 1996 by a code development committee appointed by ICC and consisting of representatives of the three statutory members of the International Code Council at that time: Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) and Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI). The intent was to draft a comprehensive set of zoning regulations for jurisdictions that have a need for a zoning ordinance and desire that it be compatible with the model codes adopted by the jurisdiction. This 2012 edition presents the code as originally issued, with changes reflected through the previous 2009 edition. A new edition of the code is promulgated every three years. This code is founded on principles intended to establish provisions consistent with the scope of a zoning code that adequately protects public health, safety and welfare; provisions that do not unnecessarily increase construction costs; provisions that do not restrict the use of new materials, products or methods of construction; and provisions that do not give preferential treatment to par- ticular types or classes of materials, products or methods of construction. The International Zoning Code is available for adoption and use by jurisdictions internationally. Its use within a governmental jurisdiction is intended to be accomplished through adoption by refer- ence in accordance with proceedings establishing the jurisdiction’s laws. At the time of adoption, jurisdictions should insert the appropriate information in provisions requiring specific local informa- tion, such as the name of the adopting jurisdiction. These locations are shown in bracketed words in small capital letters in the code and in the sample ordinance. The sample adoption ordinance on page xi addresses several key elements of a code adoption ordinance, including the information required for insertion into the code text. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” iii  Maintenance The International Zoning Code is kept up to date through the review of proposed changes submitted by code enforcing officials, industry representatives, design professionals and other interested par- ties. Proposed changes are carefully considered through an open code development process in which all interested and affected parties may participate. The contents of this work are subject to change both through the Code Development Cycles and the governmental body that enacts the code into law. For more information regarding the code development process, contact the Codes and Standards Development Department of the Interna- tional Code Council. While the development procedure of the international Zoning Code assures the highest degree of care, ICC, its members and those participating in the development of this code do not accept any liability resulting from compliance or noncompliance with the provisions because the ICC does not have the power or authority to police or enforce compliance with the contents of this code. Only the governmental body that enacts the code into law has such authority. Code Development Committee Responsibilities (Letter Designations in Front of Section Numbers or Definitions) In each code development cycle, proposed changes to the code are considered at the Code Devel- opment Hearings by the International Property Maintenance/Zoning Code Development Commit- tee, whose action constitutes a recommendation to the voting membership for final action on the proposed change. Proposed changes to a code section that has a number beginning with a letter in brackets are considered by a different code development committee. For example, proposed changes to definitions that have [B] in front of them (e.g., [B] DWELLING UNIT) are considered by one of the International Building Code Development Committees (IBC-General) at the code devel- opment hearings. The content of sections or definitions in this code that begin with a letter designation is main- tained by another code development committee in accordance with the following: [A] = Administrative Code Development Committee and [B] International Building Code Development Committee (IBC—Fire Safety, General, Means of Egress or Structural). Note that, for the development of the 2015 edition of the |-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees and they will meet in separate years. The groupings are as follows:    Group A Codes Group B Codes (Heard in 2012, Code Change Proposals (Heard in 2013, Code Change Proposals Deadline: January 3, 2012) Deadline: January 3, 2013) International Building Code Administrative Provisions (Chapter 1 all codes except IRC and ICC PC, administrative updates to currently ref- erenced standards, and designated definitions)       International Fuel Gas Code International Energy Conservation Code International Mechanical Code International Existing Building Code International Plumbing Code International Fire Code International Private Sewage International Green Construction Code Disposal Code   ICC Performance Code   International Property Maintenance Code International Residential Code    International Swimming Pool and Spa Code   International Wildland-Urban Interface Code       International Zoning Code   2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  Code change proposals submitted for code sections that have a letter designation in front of them will be heard by the respective committee responsible for such code sections. Because differ- ent committees will meet in different years, it is possible that some proposals for this code will be heard by a committee in a different year than the year in which the primary committee for this code meets. For example, the definition of “dwelling unit” in Section 202 is designated as the responsibility of the International Building Code Development Committee. This committee will hold its code devel- opment hearings in 2012 to consider all code change proposals to the international Building Code. Therefore, any proposals to this definition in Chapter 2 will be needed to be submitted by January 3, 2012, for consideration in 2012 by the appropriate International Building Code Committee (IBC- General). Note that every section of Chapter 1 of this code is designated as the responsibility of the Admin- istrative Code Development Committee, and that committee is part of the Group B portion of the code hearings. This committee will hold its code development hearings in 2013 to consider all code change proposals for Chapter 1 of this code and proposals for Chapter 1 of all |-Codes except the International Residential Code and the ICC Performance Code. Therefore, any proposals received for Chapter 1 of this code will be deferred for consideration in 2013 by the Administrative Provisions Committee. It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understand which code devel- opment committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code change proposal.

Marginal Markings Italicized Terms There have been no technical revisions between the 2009 and 2012 editions of this code. Therefore, there are no marginal markings in this edition. Selected terms set forth in Chapter 2, Definitions, are italicized where they appear in code text. Such terms are not italicized where the definition set forth in Chapter 2 does not impart the intended meaning in the use of the term. The terms selected have definitions which the user should read carefully to facilitate better understanding of the code. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” Vv  vi 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE Effective Use of the International Zoning Code The International Zoning Code (IZC) is a model code that regulates minimum zoning requirements for new buildings. The IZC is a planning and community development document. The IZC is intended to provide for the arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses and establish provisions for the location of all types of uses, in the interest of the social and economic welfare of the community. Arrangement and Format of the 2012 IZC Before applying the requirements of the IZC, it is beneficial to understand its arrangement and for- mat. The IZC, like other codes published by ICC, is arranged and organized to follow sequential steps that generally occur during a plan review or inspection. The IZC is divided into 14 different parts:"
