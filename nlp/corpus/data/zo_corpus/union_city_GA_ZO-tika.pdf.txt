provided in 13-5.D and 13-5.E. 

D. Reconstruction of nonconforming structures.  When a nonconforming 
structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use is razed or damaged 
by fire, flood, wind or act of God, such structure may be reconstructed only if 
the cost of reconstruction totals less than 60% of the replacement value of the 
structure.  The “value of the structure” shall not include the value of any 
accessory building, well, septic tank or utility in determining the extent of 
damage.  Structures which do not conform to the yard requirements of this 
Ordinance shall be governed by this provision.

associated with development and construction. (Amended 5/15/12, Ordinance 
2012-08) 

5-36 Access to Major Thoroughfares.  Lots having driveway access to arterial and 
collector streets shall be provided with a convenient vehicle turn-around which

7-4 OSC Open Space Conservation Subdivision 

 
A. Description of District.  The OSC overlay district is established to encourage the 

preservation of natural resources within residential development. Sensitive 
natural resources are protected by limiting land disturbance and decreasing 
the percentage of impervious surface within the planned community, and by 
adding flexibility to site plan design. Open space design is intended to result in 
more efficient use of land, lower development and infrastructure costs, and the 
conservation of land for recreation or aesthetic and environmental enrichment. 
It is not the intent of this overlay district to increase overall development 
densities, but to allow for the stipulated densities of the underlying zoning 
district. It is also the intent of the overlay district to encourage design flexibility, 
creativity and development complementary to surrounding and existing 
neighborhoods. Open space community (OSC) plans are approved as site plan 
specific. 

B. General Requirements. The general requirements within the OSC Overlay 
District for developments shall be as follows: 

1. The district may be overlaid upon the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-6 and RMD-1

7-6 RHC Roosevelt Highway Corridor Overlay District 

 
A.       Description of District.  The Roosevelt Highway Corridor is a 15-mile portion of 

Roosevelt Highway (US 29) from the Fulton County line in Palmetto to Camp Creek 
Parkway in College Park.  The corridor spans several governing jurisdictions, and 
includes portions of the City of Palmetto, the City of Fairburn, the City of Union 
City, the City of College Park, the Red Oak Community and unincorporated Fulton 
County. 

 
Through architectural form, landscape, hardscape, signage and graphics, this 
Overlay District seeks to reflect the history of the highway corridor, to 
accommodate modes of transportation other than the automobile such as 
bicycling, walking and transit through pedestrian oriented street design and 
circulation patterns and to improve the aesthetics of the corridor. 

 
The purpose and intent of the Roosevelt Highway Corridor Overlay District is to 
unify the Corridor with aesthetic design elements while protecting the 
separateness and individualities of the communities of Palmetto, Union City, Red 
Oak and College Park.  Moreover, this district seeks to maintain Roosevelt 
Highway’s function as a viable transportation facility that is not encumbered by 
endless commercial sprawl.  This is accomplished by segmenting the corridor 
within each community into three Development Districts: Core, Primary and 
Secondary Development Districts, which are defined below. 
 
The Core Development District (CDD) allows for the development of a pedestrian 
oriented commercial village center with a mix of uses for residents to live, work 
and relax.  The Core District includes residential uses combined with retail, service 
commercial, office and institutional uses in the same buildings.  The Core District 
supports and promotes commercial vitality and is a pedestrian oriented 
environment.  Road frontage encourages vehicles to slow down and streetscape 
features are designed for traffic calming and pedestrian safety.  Preservation of the 
existing historical character of the area is critical in the Core District. 
 
The Primary Development District (PDD) occurs outside the Core District and 
transitions the more highly developed Core to a more automobile friendly 
concept.  A mix of commercial, residential and community uses inhabit the less 
densely developed Primary District but are not permitted to be mixed into the 
same structure.  Pedestrian use is not as high in this district, and road frontage is 
geared to pedestrian safety.  The Primary District promotes a unified architectural 
style in terms of density, spacing and massing of buildings. 
 
The Secondary Development District (SDD) is the parkway that links the Primary 
Districts and serves to protect rural land and natural resources of the Roosevelt 
Highway Corridor.  The secondary District is even more automobile and truck 
oriented and generally limited to industrial and corporate complexes with natural 



 

182 | P a g e  
 

barriers screening the development off each side of the road.  While pedestrian use 
is lower here, road frontage continues to address safety associated with transit and 
school bus activities. 
 

This Overlay is adopted for the purpose of advancing community development 
goals, promoting economic development and promoting and protecting health, 
safety, order, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of Union City, Georgia. 

 
B. General Requirements.   The 15-mile Roosevelt Highway Corridor is a multi 

jurisdictional corridor and includes portions of the City of Palmetto, the City of 
Union City, The City of College Park, the Red Oak Community and unincorporated 
Fulton County between the Fulton/Coweta County line and Camp Creek Parkway.  
Core, Primary and Secondary Development Districts have been delineated with the 
Roosevelt Highway Overlay District. 

 
Specifically for the City of Union City, the Overlay District applies to all properties 
zoned or developed for nonresidential and residential uses (except single family 
detached dwelling units), and shall adhere to specific design guidelines for each 
development district set forth and detailed in the Design Guidelines for the 
Roosevelt Highway Corridor. 

 
Parcels identified in the City of Union City’s Core Development District are 
specifically delineated.  In the Primary and Secondary Districts, only parcels 
fronting Roosevelt Highway shall comply with the regulations.  

 
Whenever provisions of this section conflict with any other article or section in the 
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Union City or any other City ordinances, 
regulations or resolutions, these standards shall prevail. 
 

C.   Permitted Uses.   The Core Development District (CDD) shall utilize the Mixed-Use 
District (MXD) regulations of the City of Union City Code. The MXD District is 
intended to integrate work places, shopping, entertainment services, and housing 
and community facilities in a pedestrian friendly, village-like environment. Where 
provisions of the Mixed-Use District conflict with any articles of this resolution, the 
provisions of this article and guidelines detailed in the Design Guidelines for the 
Roosevelt Highway Corridor shall prevail. 

 
           The Primary Development District (PDD) and the Secondary Development District 
           (SDD) shall be comprised of land uses designated by The City of Union City and 

zoned accordingly, but shall be in compliance with the regulations of this overlay 
district and shall comply with guidelines detailed in the Design Guidelines for the 
Roosevelt Highway Corridor.

ARTICLE VIII 

 

TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 
 

8-1 Applicability. 

A. District height limitations.  The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall 
govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a 
height in excess of, any existing height limitations of any other zoning 
ordinances of the City.  The height limitations applicable to buildings and 
structures shall not apply to towers and antennas. 

 
B. Public property.  Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property shall 

be exempt from the requirements of this Ordinance, provided a license or lease 
authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the City Council. 

 
C. Amateur Radio: Receive-Only Antenna.  This Ordinance shall not govern any 

tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is 
owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or 
is used exclusively for receive-only antennas. 

 
D. Grandfathered Towers and Antennas.  Any tower or antenna existing on the 

effective date of this Ordinance shall not be required to meet the requirements 
of this Ordinance, other than the requirements of 8-2.E and 8-2.F.  Any such 
towers or antennas that fail to meet the requirements of this Ordinance shall 
be referred to in this Ordinance as “grandfathered towers” or “grandfathered 
antennas”. 

 
8-2 General Guidelines and Requirements. 
 

A. Purpose and Goals.  The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish guidelines for 
the siting of towers and antennas.  The goals of this Ordinance are to:   

 
1. Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to 

provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently; 
 
2. Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites; 
 
3. Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent 

possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
 
4. Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that 

minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and, 



 

199 | P a g e  
 

 
5. Discourage, specifically, the location of towers in residential areas and, 

generally, the proliferation of towers throughout the community. 
 

B. Principal or Accessory Use.  Antennas and towers may be considered either 
principal or accessory uses.  A different existing use or an existing structure on 
the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such 
lot.  For purposes of determining whether the installation of tower or antenna 
complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to 
setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements and other such 
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the 
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. 

C. Inventory of Existing Sites.  Each applicant for an administrative approval or a 
special use permit shall provide the Planning and Zoning Department with an 
inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the 
location, height and design of each tower.  The Planning and Zoning 
Department may share such information with other applicants applying for 
administrative appeals or special use permits under this Ordinance or other 
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City.   

D. Aesthetics and Lighting.  The guidelines set forth in 8-3.D shall govern the 
location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this 
Ordinance; provided, that the City may waive these requirements if, in its sole 
discretion, it determines that the goals of this Ordinance are better served 
thereby. 

 
1. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any 

applicable standards of the FAA, be painted sky blue or gray, so as to 
reduce visual obtrusiveness. 

 
2. At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to 

the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and 
landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and 
built environment. 

 
3. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and 

supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color 
that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting 
structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually 
unobtrusive as possible. 

 
4. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other 

applicable authority.  If lighting is required, the Council may review the 
available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the 
least disturbance to the surrounding views. 

 



 

200 | P a g e  
 

E.  Federal Requirements.  All towers must meet or exceed current standards and 
regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal 
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.  If such 
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and 
antennas governed by this Ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas 
into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) 
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations.  Failure to 
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and 
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at 
the owner’s expense. 

 
F.  Building Codes; Safety Standards.  To ensure the structural integrity of towers, 

the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with 
standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable 
standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries 
Association, as amended from time to time.  If, upon inspection, the City 
inspection department concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes 
and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon 
notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days 
to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards.  If the 
owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the 
governing authority may remove such tower at the owner’s expense. 

 
8-3 Conditional Uses. 

 
A. General.  The uses listed in this section are deemed to be conditional uses and 

shall require administrative review.  Nevertheless, all such uses shall comply 
with 8-2.D, 8-2.E and 8-2.F of this Ordinance and all other applicable 
Ordinances, and prior to the installation of any antenna or tower pursuant to 
this section, the owner of such antenna or tower shall send written notice to 
the Planning and Zoning Department, which notice shall include the location, 
size and configuration of such antenna or tower. 

B. Specific Conditional Uses.  The following uses are conditionally permitted 
 

1. Locating a tower in an M-1 or M-2 Zoning District or within any property 
located within 1,000 feet of either side of the right-of-way of a collector, 
arterial or interstate road on property zoned TCMU (added 7/20/10, 
Ordinance 10-13); provided, however, that such tower shall be set back 
from any existing off-site residential structure a distance equal to the height 
of the tower, plus 50 feet; 

 
2. Installing an antenna in an M-1 or M-2 Zoning District or within any 

property located within 1,000 feet of either side of the right-of-way of a 
collector, arterial or interstate road on property zoned TCMU (added 
7/20/10, Ordinance 10-13) on an existing structure that is 50 feet in height 
or greater, so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to 
the height of said existing structure, such structures to include buildings, 



 

201 | P a g e  
 

signs, light poles, water towers and other free-standing non-residential 
structures; and, 

3. Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long as the 
addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said 
existing tower and said existing tower is not a grandfathered tower. 



 

202 | P a g e  
 

8-4 Administrative Approvals. 
 

A. General. 
 

1. The Planning and Zoning Department may administratively approve the 
uses listed in this section. 

 
2. Applicants for administrative approval shall apply to the Planning and 

Zoning Department, providing the information set forth in 8-5.B and 8-5.D 
of this Ordinance. 

 
3. The Planning and Zoning Department shall respond to each such 

application within 30 days of receiving it by either approving the 
application, denying the application, or requesting further information 
from the applicant.  If the Planning and Zoning Department fails to respond 
to the applicant within said 30 days, then the application shall be deemed 
to be approved. 

 
4. In connection with any such administrative approval, the Planning and 

Zoning Department may, in order to encourage shared use, 
administratively waive any district setback requirement by up to 50%. 

 
B. Specific Administratively Approved Uses.  The following uses may be approved 

by the Planning and Zoning Department after conducting an administrative 
review: 

 
1. Installing an antenna in an M-1 or M-2 or within any property located within 

1,000 feet of either side of the right-of-way of a collector, arterial or 
interstate road on property zoned TCMU (added 7/20/10, Ordinance 10-
13)Zoning District on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a 
building, sign, light pole, water tower or other free standing non-residential 
structure), so long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the 
height of the existing structure. 

 
2. Installing an antenna on an existing tower, including a grandfathered tower 

and further including the placement of additional buildings or other 
supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the 
addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said 
existing tower. 

 
8-5 Conditional Use Permits. 
 

A. General.  The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use 
permits: 

 
1. A conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or 

the placement of an antenna. 



 

203 | P a g e  
 

 
2. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, 

whether civil, mechanical, electrical or radio-frequency, shall be certified by 
a qualified professional engineer. 

 
B. Site Plan.  Applicants requesting a conditional use permit under this ordinance 

shall submit a scaled site plan, showing the location and dimensions of all 
improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency 
coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, 
landscaping and other information necessary to access compliance with this 
Ordinance.  
 

C. Factors Considered in Granting Conditional Use Permits.  The City shall 
consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional 
use permit, although the City may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant 
of one or more of these criteria, if, in the sole discretion of the City, the goals of 
this Ordinance are better served thereby: 

 
1. Height of the proposed tower; 
 
2. Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district 

boundaries; 
 
3. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
 
4. Surrounding topography; 
 
5. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
 
6. Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that 

have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and, 
 
7. Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in 

Section 8-3 of this Ordinance. 
 

D. Availability of Suitable Existing Towers or Other Structures.  No new tower shall 
be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction 
of the City that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant’s 
proposed antenna.  Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower 
or structure can accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna may consist 
of the following: 

 
1. No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area 

required to meet applicant’s engineering requirements; 
 
2. Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant’s 

engineering requirements; 



 

204 | P a g e  
 

 
3. Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to 

support applicant’s proposed antenna and related equipment; 
 
4. Applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference 

with the antenna on the existing towers or structure; 
 
5. The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt 

an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable.  Costs 
exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable; 

 
6. Property owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to 

accommodate reasonably the applicant’s needs; and,  
 
7. Applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render 

existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
 

E. Setbacks and Separation.  The following setbacks and separation requirements 
shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is 
required; provided, however, that the City may, in its sole discretion, reduce the 
standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this Ordinance 
would be better served thereby. 

 
1. Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 50 

feet from any off site residential structure; 
 
2. Towers, guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum district yard 

setback requirements; and, 
 
3. Towers over 70 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a 

mile from any existing tower that is over 70 feet in height. 
 

F. Security Fencing.  Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six 
(6) feet and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; 
provided, however, that the City may, in its sole discretion, waive such 
requirements if the goals of this Ordinance would be better served thereby. 

 
1. Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer that effectively screens the 

view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property.  The 
standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide 
outside the perimeter of the compound; 

 
2. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the 

landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether; and, 
 
3. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be 

preserved to the maximum extent possible.  In some cases, such as towers 



 

205 | P a g e  
 

sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter 
may be a sufficient buffer. 

 
8-6 Removal of Abandoned Towers and Antennas.  Any antenna or tower that is not 

operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, 
and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of 
receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such abandonment.    If such 
antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the governing authority may 
remove such antenna or tower at the owner’s expense.  If there are two or more 
users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users 
cease using the tower.

ARTICLE IX 
 

TREE PRESERVATION AND LANDSCAPE ENHANCEMENT 

 

9-1 Purpose 
 

The purpose of this ordinance is to create and maintain a structure of standards 
that will preserve and conserve the rural and urban wooded environment of Union 
City now and into the future.  There is great value in trees and they are a resource 
that belongs to the whole community.  Because trees are a resource that is like any 
other valuable resource, they will be maintained and protected.  Union City will 
plant tree species that are best suited for this environment (hardy, durable and 
highly adaptable) and encourage private citizens to do the same.  Union City will 
require replanting of trees by construction companies, developers, and other 
businesses that remove trees in our community. 

 
Furthermore, trees generate public benefits including: 

1. The purification of air; 
2. The moderation of the micro-climate; 
3. The reduction of noise and glare; 
4. The conservation of energy in terms of heating and cooling; 
5. The prevention of soil erosion; 
6. Reduced costs in terms of stormwater management; 
7. The minimization of flood potential; 
8. Improve water quality; 
9. The enhancement and stabilization of property values; 
10. Improved aesthetics; 
11. The preservation of rural character. 

 
9-2  Applicability. 
 

A. This ordinance shall apply to any activity that requires a Land Disturbance 
Permit.   

B. Exemptions from The City of Union City Tree Protection and Landscape 
Enhancement Ordinance are: 
 
1. Trees found to be dead, diseased, insect-infested, or severely damaged by 

storms or wind as determined by the Zoning Administrator or his or her 
designee, an Arborist, a Registered Forester or the Georgia Forestry 
Commission. 

2. Orchards and tree nurseries in active commercial operations; 



 

207 | P a g e  
 

3. All property involved in a viable agricultural operation (establishment, 
cultivation, or harvesting of fields) or livestock operation;  
 

4. Playgrounds, golf courses, athletic fields or courts approved by the City; 
and, 

 
5. The removal, replacement, planting, pruning, or transplanting of trees on 

an existing single-family or duplex residential property that has formerly 
received a Certificate of Occupancy and remains in residential use. 

 
C. Non-conforming Uses.  This Ordinance shall not apply to any portion of a 

property included within the limits of a valid land disturbance permit issued 
prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, subject to all time constraints 
relating the permit issued and provided that all requirements of Chapter 5-34 
that were in effect upon the date of issuance of the land disturbance permit 
shall be met, except requirements duly varied as provided by Article XIII of the 
Union City Zoning Ordinance. 

 
9-3 Procedure. 
 

A. Application Procedure.  A Tree Protection Plan (TPP) must be submitted to the 
Zoning Administrator or his designee upon application for a Land Disturbance 
Permit.  For purposes of the Tree Protection and Landscape Enhancement 
Ordinance the Zoning Administrator’s designee is the City Engineer.  The TPP 
may be combined with required Construction Plans or Site Plans when 
possible.  The TPP must be prepared by a qualified Landscape Architect, 
Registered Forester or Arborist except when the land disturbing activity is for a 
detached single-family development or lot within such development.  In the 
case of a detached single-family development or lot within such development, 
the TPP may also be prepared by the owner, developer or contractor applying 
for a Land Disturbance Permit. 

 
B. Application Requirements. 
 

1. Tree Survey. A tree survey shall be submitted along with a Tree Protection 
Plan in the construction plan and site plan approval process.  The tree 
survey shall be prepared in the field by an Arborist, Registered Landscape 
Architect or Registered Forester and recorded on a site plan using a scale of 
not greater than 1”=50’.  It shall identify the location, size, and species 
(common name) of all trees existing on the site.  All trees 12 inches and 
larger shall be shown on the Tree Survey.  Trees larger than two (2) inches 
shall be identified if they are to be counted toward required tree density for 
the Tree Protection Plan. Trees other than specimen trees that are outside 
the protected zone are not required to be counted, but shall be identified 
as a stand, with information concerning the approximate number, size, and 
species noted on the survey drawing. 



 

208 | P a g e  
 

2. Tree Protection Plan (TPP). Three (3) copies of a TPP shall be submitted with 
other documents required for construction plan or site plan approval 
before any land disturbance occurs. The TPP shall be prepared by an 
Arborist, Registered Landscape Architect or Registered Forester.  The TPP 
shall be submitted on a current topographic survey of the site, and drawn 
to the same scale as the Tree Survey, but not less than 1”=50’.  The TPP shall 
clearly show all of the information listed below: 

 
a. The identity of the tract of land upon which trees sought to be removed 

are located, including land lot, land district, adjacent streets and all 
boundaries of the tract. 
 

b. The name, address, and phone number of the owner of the land and of 
the applicant, if not the owner. 

 
c. The type, location, and size of specimen trees, significant trees, and 

other trees being protected and preserved. Only trees designated on 
the TPP shall count toward required density.  

 
d. The location, size, species, and critical root zone of any specimen trees, 

including those intended to be removed. 
 

e. All protected areas, natural areas, landscape areas, zoning buffer areas, 
stream buffer areas, and areas of tree replacement. 

 
f. Locations, details and specifications for tree protection measures, 

including tree fencing, erosion control, retaining walls, tunneling for 
utilities, aeration systems, transplanting, staking and signage.  

 
g. Limits of clearing and land disturbance such as grading, cut and fill, 

indicating where these disturbances may affect tree protection zones. 
 

h. Locations of all existing and proposed utility lines or easements.  
 

i. Indicate staging areas for parking, material storage, burn pits and other 
areas where tree protection may be affected.  

 
j. Calculations showing compliance with the required tree density using 

existing trees, replacement trees, and alternative methods of 
compliance. Existing trees or stands of trees to be counted in the 
density requirements must be indicated and tabulated.  Only existing 
trees with a DBH of two (2) inches or greater may be counted toward 
the minimum tree density.  

 
k. Site Improvements and Structures including but not limited to 

buildings, canopies, retaining walls, signs, parking, driveways, utility 



 

209 | P a g e  
 

lines and poles, dumpster enclosures, fences, detention ponds, 
walkways, and other paved surfaces. 

 
l. Other information required by the City Engineer. 

 
4. TPP Review and Approval. The City Engineer will review the TPP for 

conformance with the applicable requirements of this ordinance and will 
either approve the TPP or return it for revisions.  The review will normally be 
completed within fifteen (15) working days after it was received. Required 
revisions will be stated in writing.  

 
5. Final Inspection.  No building permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be 

issued with respect to any development or individual lot unless the Zoning 
Administrator or his or her designee shall have inspected the appropriate 
areas of the site and determined that all existing trees to remain are in 
healthy condition and all replacement trees are acceptable and have been 
planted in accordance with this section.  

 
6. Compliance and Enforcement.  Issuance of a Land Disturbance Permit shall 

be contingent on approval of the TPP. The Zoning Administrator shall have 
the authority to revoke, suspend, or void any Land Disturbance Permit, stop 
all work on a site or any portion thereof, or withhold a Certificate of 
Occupancy when there has been a violation or failure to comply with any of 
the provisions of Article IX.   

 
7. Appeals and Variances.  Any applicant who is aggrieved by the decision of 

the Zoning Administrator or City Engineer shall have the right to appeal 
said decision as provided under Article XIII of the Union City Zoning 
Ordinance. Any final decision of the City or courts in the case of an appeal 
which provides for limitations on the property of a tree owners, shall be 
recorded so the at record notice of the decision is given to successors in 
interest of the tree owner’s property. 

 
8. Violation and penalty.  Any person, firm, or corporation violating the 

provisions of this ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each tree cut, 
damaged, or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense and each day’s 
continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate offense. The 
Municipal Court shall have jurisdiction to try offenses of these regulations. 

 
9-4 Standards of Tree Preservation and Replacement 
 

A. Tree Preservation. 
 

1. It shall be the policy of the City of Union City that preserving existing native 
species of trees is preferred to replacing them with newly planted trees.  
Tree removal may be disallowed where reasonable accommodations can 
be made to alter the proposed project to save significant trees and such 



 

210 | P a g e  
 

accommodation has not been made in the grading plan, site plan, or 
building plan. 

 
2. Specimen trees shall be preserved wherever feasible except for trees that 

are diseased, structurally unsound, or damaged to such a degree that they 
are unlikely to survive and may pose a threat to human safety or cause 
serious property damage.   

 
3. Specimen trees that are in good health and condition shall not be removed 

from any proposed right of way or from the protected area of any private 
property without approval from the City Engineer. The City Engineer may 
authorize removal of a healthy, sound specimen tree only if he or she finds 
the location of the tree is clearly within the buildable area of the lot or 
street right-of-way and the relocation of necessary permanent buildings or 
site improvements to save the tree would not be feasible. Removal of any 
other specimen tree from private property shall be prohibited. 

 
4. Tree removal shall be disallowed if severe soil erosion or runoff problems 

will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to flood plain or stream 
buffer, and the removal will substantially alter the existing soils and 
increase runoff and erosion.   

 
5. Trees shall not be removed from the floodplain, except as follows: 

 
a. Trees found to be diseased or insect infested by the Zoning 

Administrator, County Extension Service, the Georgia Forestry 
Commission, an Arborist, or a Registered Forester; or 
 

b. As necessary for construction, repair or maintenance of public roads, 
utilities or drainage systems; or  

 
c. As part of a Corp of Engineers approved wetland mitigation plan.  

 
6. Existing trees to be preserved on a lot or site which is the subject of a 

permit allowing land disturbance shall be protected from damage due to 
physical root damage, indirect root damage, and trunk and crown damage. 
Protective measures should be defined in the TPP for trees that are not to 
be removed. Protection measures shall include but are not limited to:  

 
a. Approved protective fencing installed to encircle critical root zones of 

trees to be preserved.  All protective measures shall remain in

improvement(s) or any activity shall encroach or place solvents, 
material, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six 



 

211 | P a g e  
 

(6) feet of the area outside the critical root zone, as defined herein, of 
any existing tree that is subject to preservation in accordance with this 
section. 

 
c. Increasing the grade by adding soil layers onto the tree’s root system or 

trenching below a tree’s roots shall only be done with the approval of 
the City Engineer.  

 
B. Tree Density Requirements. 

 
1. Property subject to Article IX shall be developed so as to provide a 

minimum tree density of 100 inches per acre of the entire tract being 
developed.  The tree density shall be calculated as a collective 
measurement of tree trunk diameter of existing and replacement trees.  
Existing trees to be preserved shall be given density credit based on their 
size measured in DBH.  The size of replacement trees shall be measured 
according to nursery standards using tree caliper.  
 

2. Within the protected areas of the site at least 50 percent of all significant 
trees shall be preserved.  

 
3. Replacement trees required to be planted on the site may include street 

trees.  
 

4. Parking Lot Landscaping.  Off-street parking lots, which contain more than 
five (5) off-street parking spaces on any single lot, shall contain landscaping 
and plantings along streets as provided in Article X. Such trees may be 
counted toward tree density requirements.  

 
5. Alternative compliance.  Where the City Engineer determines that 

minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints, the 
number of trees to be planted on a site or lot shall be determined by the 
City Engineer based on site review.  Thereafter, the owner/ developer/ 
builder shall, with the concurrence of the City Engineer, provide the 
remaining balance of required trees to be planted on City property, 
including rights of way of existing streets. When this approach is exercised, 
the City shall first determine the variety, size, and number of trees to be 
furnished by the owner/ developer/ builder. The City then will obtain prices 
from a minimum of two (2) Plant Nurseries and/ or Landscape contractors, 
selected by the City to supply and plant the required plant materials. Prior 
to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, an amount equal to the lower 
of the bid prices will be paid by the owner/ developer/ builder to the City.  
The City, at its option, may elect to proceed to have planting done on City 
land or right of way or to hold these funds until more suitable planting 
conditions prevail. Upon payment, the owner/ developer/ builder will be 
relieved of any further responsibility for the fulfillment of these 
requirement for the subject property.  



 

212 | P a g e  
 

 
6. If landscaping is not established, the Zoning Administrator or his/her 

designee may approve issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy conditioned 
on provision of cash, cashier’s check or money (Cash Deposit) order to be 
deposited in an escrow account in the amount of 110 percent of the City 
Engineer’s estimate of the cost of completing all required work.  The Cash 
Deposit shall be held for a period of 18 months.  In the event that the 
landscaping work is not completed prior to the date on which said 18 
months expires, the City shall be entitled to use said Cash Deposit to 
complete the landscape work on behalf of the property owner. At the time 
of the acceptance of the Cash Deposit, the permittee, builder or owner shall 
sign a document informing him or her of the provisions necessary to 
complete the landscape work. The document referred to herein shall be 
signed by the permitee, builder or owner prior to the time a certificate of 
occupancy is issued. (Ordinance 11-08, 6/21/11)

surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of Union City, to protect

11-8 Administration and Enforcement. 
 

A. Powers and Duties of Personnel. 
 

1.  Generally.  The Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to 
administer this ordinance.  Unless otherwise specifically provided by resolution 
of the Mayor and Council, the enforcement of this ordinance shall be within the 
jurisdiction of the Union City Code Enforcement Officer. 
 

2.  Specific powers and duties. 
 

a. Issuance or denial of permits.  It shall be the duty of the Zoning 
Administrator, upon receipt of a completed application for a sign permit, to 
examine the plans and specifications and other data.  If the proposed 
structure is in compliance with the requirements of this section and all 
other applicable provisions of this ordinance, a written permit shall be 
issued to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator.  If said structure is not 
in compliance with the requirements of this section and all other applicable 
provisions of this ordinance, a written denial of permit shall be issued to the 
applicant by the Zoning Administrator.  In no case shall any process of 
application review extend for a period of time exceeding thirty days from 
the date of the Zoning Administrator’s receipt of application to the date 
upon which a denial is mailed.  Should the process exceed thirty days, it 
shall be deemed that the application is approved and a permit shall be 
issued to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator.  Issuance of a permit 
shall in no way prevent the City from later declaring the sign to be illegal if 
the structure fails to substantially comply with the specifications submitted 
in the application or some new information of illegality is discovered.  
(amended September 16, 2003, Ordinance 2003-11) 
 

b. Revocation of permits and certificates.  The Zoning Administrator may 
revoke a sign permit or certificate of compliance in those cases where an 
administrative determination has been duly made that false statements or 
misrepresentations existed as to material facts in the application or plans 
upon which the permit of approval was based. 

 
c. Suspension of permits and certificates.  The Zoning Administrator may 

suspend a sign permit or certificate of compliance where an administrative 
determination has been duly made that an error or omission on the part of 
either the permit applicant or a government agency existed in the issuance 
of the permit or certificate.  A new permit or certificate shall be issued in 
place of the incorrect permit or certificate after correction of the error or 
omission. 

 
B. Permits; Inspection. 

 



 

227 | P a g e  
 

1.  Issuance of permits.  No sign, except for those signs in Section 11-6 herein, shall 
be erected, hung, placed or structurally altered without a permit.  Failure to 
obtain and permit prior to placing or erecting a sign shall, assuming the sign is 
permittable, result in a double fee.  The fees for all permits shall be set by the 
Mayor and Council and a fee schedule shall be kept for public inspection by the 
City Clerk. 
 

2.  Filing procedure.  Application for permits to erect, hang or place a sign shall be 
submitted on forms obtainable from the Zoning Administrator.  Each 
application shall be accompanied by plans showing the area, size, character 
and method of illumination of the sign, if any; the exact location proposed for 
the sign; in the case of a projecting sign, the proposed method of fastening 
said sign to the building structure; the vertical and horizontal distance between 
such sign and the finished grade; and the horizontal distance between such 
sign and the street right-of-way. 

 
3.  Inspection.  A representative of the City shall inspect each sign or other 

advertising structure regulated by this ordinance from time to time for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether such structure is safe and lawful.  If a sign is 
deemed to be in need of repair, the owner shall have 14 days from the date of 
written notice from the City, in which to repair or remove such sign.  Missing 
letters from a raised letter or changeable copy sign, missing panels, peeling 
paint from a painted sign, etc. shall constitute a need for repair.  

 
4.  Lapse of sign permit.  A continuing sign permit shall lapse automatically if the 

occupational tax certificate for the premises lapses, is revoked or is not 
renewed.  A sign permit shall also lapse if the business activity on the premises 
is discontinued for a period of 60 days or more and is not renewed within 30 
days of notice from the City to the last permittee, sent to the premises, that the 
sign permit will lapse is such activity is not renewed. 

 
5.  Billboard Construction.  All applications for new billboard construction shall be 

treated as an application for a principal structure. 
 

C. Nonconforming Signs.  
 

1.  Nonconforming existing signs.  A freestanding or wall sign for which a sign 
permit was issued which was in existence on or before December 20, 2005, or 
which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable 
laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which by reason of its size, 
height, location, design or construction is not in conformance with the 
requirements of this ordinance, shall be considered a nonconforming sign.  
Such a sign shall be allowed to remain in place and be maintained (provided 
that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the 
nonconformity) until there is a change of business name (single business), a 
change of complex name (multi-business), or the sign and/or supporting 
structure is totally destroyed as a result of natural causes, Acts of God, 



 

228 | P a g e  
 

vandalism or any other cause.  In the case of a change of ownership where the 
business name and existing signage (face and structure) remain the same, said 
sign shall be allowed to remain in place. 
 

2.  Lapse of nonconforming sign permit.  A nonconforming sign permit shall lapse 
and become void under the same circumstances as those under which any 
other sign permit may lapse and become void. 

 
11-9 Measurement; Construction and Maintenance Standards. 
 

A. Measurement of Sign Area.  The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a 
wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the 
smallest geographic measurement that will encompass the extreme limits of the 
writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or 
color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to 
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. 

 
B. Measurement of Sign Height.  The height of a sign shall be computed as to the 

distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest 
attached component of the sign.  The decorative façade, including post and/or 
columns, shall not exceed 25 feet in height.  Normal grade shall be construed to be 
the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established 
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating 
solely for the purpose of locating the sign.  In cases in which the normal grade 
cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the 
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal 
to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of 
the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, 
whichever is greater.  Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a 
public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of 
the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor’s certificate required). 

 
C. Sign Location.   

 
1.  Obstructions to doors, windows or fire escapes.  No sign shall be erected, 

relocated or maintained so as to prevent free ingress or egress from any door, 
window or fire escape. 

 
2.  Signs not to constitute traffic hazard.  No sign or part thereof, except 

authorized traffic signs, shall be located in any state, county or city right-of-
way.  No sign may be located any closer than 15 feet from an intersection as 
measured from the intersection of the two (2) rights-of-way.  

 
D. Construction Standards. 

 
1.  Face of sign shall be smooth.  No sign shall be constructed so as to have nails, 

tacks or wires protruding there from. 



 

229 | P a g e  
 

2.  Illumination of signs.  Signs, when illumination is permitted, may be 
illuminated internally or externally.   
 

E. Maintenance and Appearance. 
 

1.  All signs shall be maintained in good condition in order to present a neat 
appearance.  The City may remove after due notice, any sign which shows 
neglect or becomes dilapidated.

year.  It is the intent of this section that the terms be staggered.  Any vacancy in the 
membership shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial 
appointment.  If one appointee be from the said Planning Commission and he 
ceases to be a member of said Planning Commission during the term of his 
appointment to the Board, his membership shall terminate and the governing 
authority may name a member of said Planning Commission to fill the unexpired

if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its 
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the 
office of said Board and shall be a public record.  The decisions of the Board shall 
contain a statement of the subject matter being considered by the Board, the 
decisions of the Board, and the grounds of its decision reduced to written form.  No 
appeal requesting the same relief in regard to the same property shall be received or 
heard by the Board for a period of 12 months following the date of said decision, 
except that this limitation shall not affect the right of said Board to grant a rehearing 
as provided in rules of procedure as may be adopted by the Board.

administrative and clerical assistance and office space as is required by the Board to

for a variance, or any other matter within the Board’s purview, said Board shall hold

241 | P a g e  
 

 
13-5 Powers and Duties.   
 

A. Appeals from Actions of Zoning Administrator.  The Board shall hear and decide 
upon appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, 
decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement 
of these regulations. 

 
1. Who May Appeal.  Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved 

or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the governing authority 
affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator.  Such appeals shall be 
filed no later than 30 days after the date of notification of the decision 
appealed from the filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a 
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.  The Zoning Administrator 
shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record 
upon which the action appealed from was taken. 

 
2. Legal Proceedings Stayed.  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance 

of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the 
Board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his 
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.  In such a case, proceedings 
shall not be stayed otherwise than by restraining order which may be granted 
by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning 
Administrator, and on due cause shown. 
 

3. Extent of Board of Appeals Power.  The Board may, in conformity with the 
provisions of these regulations, reverse or affirm the requirement, decision or 
determination of the Zoning Administrator.  The Board may direct the issuance 
of a permit.  It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to carry out the 
decisions of the Board. 

 
B.  Request for a Variance.  The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases 

such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the 
public interest where, owing the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the 
provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical 
difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be 
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; 
provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or 
building or structure that is prohibited by this Ordinance in the District in question.  
A variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the Board that 
the following exists: 

 
1. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular 

piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
 

2. The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would 
create a practical difficulty of unnecessary hardship; 



 

242 | P a g e  
 

 
3. Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 

 
4. Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or 

impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided, however, no 
variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is 
prohibited by this Ordinance; 
 

5. A literal interpretation of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of any 
rights that others in the same District are allowed; and, 
 

6. Provided that the Board may impose or require such additional restrictions and 
standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and 
residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the 
general neighborhoods; and provided that wherever the Board shall find, in the 
case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that 
any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was 
granted are not being complied with, said Board shall rescind and revoke such 
permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full 
opportunity for a hearing.  In exercising the above powers, the Board shall not 
consider any non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures of buildings 
in the same District, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in 
other Districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance. 

 
D.  Request for Extension or Enlargement of the Nonconforming Use of a Structure.  

The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension of an existing 
non-conforming use which the Board is specifically authorized to pass on under 
the terms of this Ordinance.  Said extension may be granted in an individual case 
upon a finding by the Board that: 
1. The use is a non-conformance as defined in these regulations; 

 
2. The use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations 

applicable to non-conformances; and, 
 

3. The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent 
property in the same District. 

 
E.  Continuance of Nonconformance.  The Board may allow a non-conformance to be 

reestablished after discontinuance for 12 consecutive months where it is deemed 
by the Board that; 
 
1. The design, construction and character of the land, building or structure is not 

suitable for uses permitted in the District in which the non-conformance is 
situated; 
 

2. Undue hardships to the property owner would result in not allowing the 
continuance of a non-conformance; 



 

243 | P a g e  
 

 
3. Adjacent property would not be unduly damaged by such continuance; and, 

 
4. The use is to be identical to the prior non-conformance. 

 
F. Compliance with Standards.  Where and application to the Board is initiated due to 

an existing violation of the Ordinance and said application is denied, the violation 
shall be required to be corrected within 10 days of such denial or as specified by 
the Board if a greater time period is necessary.  The maximum extension of the 
time shall not exceed 30 days. 
 

G. Forms.  Forms shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator for the Board, and the 
appellant shall pay the Zoning Administrator for expenses incidental to the appeal.  
No form shall be accepted by the Zoning Administrator unless it contains all 
pertinent information and is accompanied by the required fee to defray expenses.  
Appeals, requests for variance, and requests for extension or continuance of non-
conformance must contain the following information: 

1. Requests for Variance

g. A sketch plan or preliminary plan indicating the intended use of the 
property, including, but not limited to, proposed streets and lot layouts, 
access and egress routes, buffer areas, parking, etc.  In general, the plat 
should contain sufficient data so as to clearly indicate proposed land uses.  
A sketch plan, with a scale not less than 1” per 200’ shall be acceptable; 
however, should the applicant prefer, a preliminary plat meeting all the 
requirements of the Union City Subdivision Regulations shall be submitted. 

h. A letter of intent indicating specifically how the property is to be used.  Said 
letter shall be detailed as necessary to clearly describe the proposed site 
development. Existing uses and zoning of nearby property.

question because of its size, shape, topography or other condition, which 
justifies the variance requested?

public health, safety and general welfare secured.  The decision of the Mayor and 
Council shall be contained in a written report prepared by the City Clerk.  The report
