 1-1 Article 1: General Provisions 

ARTICLE 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS  

§1-1. Authority and Enactment Clause.  

The City Council of the City of Gulf Shores, Alabama, 
hereinafter referred to as “the Council”, in pursuance 
of the authority granted by Title 11, Chapter 52, Article 
4, Sections 70-84 inclusive, Code of Alabama, 1975, 
hereby ordains and enacts into law the following 
sections.    

§1-2. Short Title.  

This Ordinance shall be known as and may be cited 
as “The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Gulf Shores, 
Alabama.” 

§1-3. Purpose.  

The zoning regulations and districts as herein set forth 
are made in accordance with a comprehensive plan 
for the purposes of guiding development to meet 
existing and future needs and to protect, promote and 
improve the public health, safety, convenience, order, 
prosperity, and general welfare of the residents. 
These regulations are designed to lessen congestion 
in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and 
other dangers; to promote health and the general 
welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent 
the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue 
concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate 
provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, 
parks and other public requirements. These 
regulations are made with reasonable consideration, 
among other things, of the character of each district 
and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with 
a view to promoting desirable living conditions and the 
sustained stability of neighborhoods, protecting 
property against blight and depreciation, securing 
economy in governmental expenditures, and 
conserving the value of land, Buildings and Structures.  

§1-4. Scope.  

No Building, Structure, or land shall hereafter be used, 
occupied, and no Building, Structure or part thereof 
shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, 
moved or structurally altered unless in conformity with 
all the regulations of this Ordinance for the district in 
which it is located, except as otherwise provided 
herein. 

§1-5. Interpretation.  

In interpreting and applying the provisions of this 
Ordinance, they shall be held to be the minimum 
requirements for the protection, promotion and 
improvement of the public health, safety, comfort, 
order, appearance, convenience, morals and general 
welfare of the community. It is not intended by this 
Ordinance to interfere with or abrogate or annul any 

easements, covenants or other agreements between 
parties; provided, however, where this Ordinance 
imposes a greater restriction upon the use of Buildings 
or Premises or upon the height of Buildings, or 
requires larger Open Spaces than are imposed or 
required by other Ordinances, rules, regulations or by 
easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions 
of this Ordinance shall control. If because of error or 
omission in the zoning map any property in the City is 
not shown as being in a zoning district, the 
classification of such property shall be R-1-1 unless 
changed by amendment to the zoning map or by 
subsequent Zoning Ordinances. 

§1-6. Validity.  

In the event any court of competent jurisdiction should 
hold that any Article, Section, Subsection, Paragraph 
or Item, clause or provision of this Ordinance is 
invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the 
Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof, other than 
the part so declared to be invalid. 

§1-7. Re-enactment and Repeal of Previous Zoning 
Ordinance.  

This Ordinance amends and in part carries forward by 
re-enactment some of the provisions of the Zoning 
Ordinance of the City of Gulf Shores, adopted on 
February 18, 1963, as amended, and it is not the 
intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue 
in force such existing provisions so that all rights and 
liabilities that have accrued hereunder are preserved 
and may be enforced. All provisions of the Zoning 
Ordinance of the City of Gulf Shores adopted on 
February 18, 1963, as amended, which are not re-
enacted herein are hereby repealed. All suits at law or 
in equity and/or all prosecutions resulting from the 
violation of any zoning resolution heretofore in effect, 
which are not pending in any of the courts of this State 
or of the United States, shall not be abated or 
abandoned by reason of the adoption of this 
Ordinance but shall be prosecuted to their finality the 
same as if this Ordinance had not been adopted; any 
and all violations of the existing Zoning Ordinance, 
prosecutions for which have not yet been instituted, 
may be hereafter filed and prosecuted; and nothing in 
this Ordinance shall be so construed as to abandon, 
abate, or dismiss any litigation or prosecution now 
pending, and/or which may heretofore have been 
instituted or prosecuted.  

§1-8. Effect Upon Outstanding Building Permits.  

Nothing herein contained shall require any change in 
the plans, size, construction or designated use of any 
Building, Structure or part thereof for which a Building 
Permit had been granted by the City before the time of 
passage of this Ordinance; provided, that where

construction is not begun under such outstanding 
permit within a period of sixty (60) days subsequent to 
passage of this Ordinance or where it has not been 
prosecuted to completion within eighteen (18) months 
subsequent to passage of this Ordinance, any further 
construction or use shall be in conformance with the 
provisions of this Ordinance. 

 

  
  
 



 

 

 2-1  Article 2: Using this Ordinance 

  

ARTICLE 2: USING THIS ORDINANCE 

§2-1. Organization.  

This Ordinance is organized as follows: 

A. For purposes of organization, this Zoning Ordinance, is 
divided into twenty-two (22) Articles. The Article 
designation number represents the first digit (or two as 
the case may be) of that series of numbers used to 
identify the respective regulations of the Ordinance; e.g., 
in the reference number §6-4A1, the digit “6” represents 
the Article. 

B. Each Article within the Zoning Ordinance is subdivided 
into several major headings known as Sections, which 
are represented by the second digit; e.g., in the 
reference number §6-4A1, the digit “4” represents the 
Section. 

C. Each Section within the Zoning Ordinance is subdivided 
into Subsections, which are represented by the upper-
case letter following the Section designation number; 
e.g., in the reference number §6-4A1 the letter “A” 
represents the Subsection. 

D. Each Subsection within the Zoning Ordinance may be 
subdivided into Paragraphs, which are represented by 
the digit following the Subsection designation; e.g., in 
the reference number §6-4A1 the digit “1” represents the 
Paragraph. 

E. Each Paragraph may be subdivided into Items, which 
are represented by the lower-case letter following the 
Paragraph designation; which may then be further 
subdivided as (1), (2), (3)... (a), (b), (c)…and (i), (ii), 
(iii)… 

§2-2. Internal Referencing. 

All references to Articles, Sections, Subsections, 
Paragraphs and Items within this Ordinance shall refer 
to Articles, Sections, Subsections, Paragraphs and 
Items in this Ordinance unless otherwise specified. 
When an Article, Section or other subdivision is 
referenced within a provision or requirement of this 
Ordinance, unless otherwise specified, all subdivisions 
within such reference shall be assumed to be 
applicable. 

§2-3. Page Numbering.  

Each Article contains its own separate page 
numbering system. The page numbers are prefixed by 
the respective Article number. As an example, page 
10 of Article 8 is designated page 8-10.

 3-1 Article 3: Administration 

ARTICLE 3: ADMINISTRATION 

§3-1. General Procedure.  

A. General Sequence of Steps. All persons desiring to 
undertake Excavation, new construction, Structural 
Alteration, or changes in the use of a Building or Lot 
shall apply to the Building Official for a Building Permit 
by filling out the appropriate application form and by 
submitting the required fee. Where no Excavation, new 
construction, or Structural Alteration is to occur, but 
where a new use or new occupancy is to occur on an 
existing Premises, a Certificate of Occupancy shall be 
required. The Zoning Official will then either issue or 
refuse the Building Permit or Certificate as appropriate 
or refer the application to the Council or BZA. After the 
Building Permit has been issued to the applicant, the 
applicant may proceed to undertake the action permitted 
in the Building Permit. If the Building Official finds that 
the action of the applicant has been taken in accordance 
with the Building Permit, or where no construction is 
proposed and the desired occupancy conforms with this 
Ordinance, a Certificate of Occupancy shall then be 
issued allowing the Premises to be occupied. 

B. Other Reviews or Permits Required. Certain 
development requests may also require Conditional Use 
Permits (CUP), Site Plan Review, Variances, and/or 
Land Disturbing Activity Permits. Procedures for 
Variances by the BZA are described in Article 17. All 
other permits and review procedures are described in 
this Article. 

C. Zoning Official. The Director is hereby designated to be 
the Zoning Official. It shall be the duty of the Zoning 
Official to enforce and administer the provisions of this 
Ordinance and to interpret the meaning of the 
Ordinance in the course of enforcement. He may 
delegate the responsibility for the enforcement and 
administration of this Ordinance to members of his staff. 

§3-2. Building Permit and Land Disturbing Activity Permit 
Required.  

No Building or Structure shall be erected and no 
existing Building shall be moved, altered, added to, or 
enlarged until a Building Permit therefore has been 
issued by the Building Official. No Excavation, 
grading, or similar land disturbing activity shall occur 
until a Land Disturbance Permit has been issued by 
the Public Works Department. 

A. Building Permit Types. Under the terms of this 
Ordinance, the following classes of Building Permits 
may be issued: 

1. Permitted Use: A Building Permit for a permitted use, 
including permitted uses subject to Article 11 Specific 
Use Regulations, may be issued by the Building 
Official only upon confirmation from the Zoning Official 

that the proposal is in conformance with the Zoning 
Ordinance. 

2. Conditional Use/Site Plan Review: A Building Permit 
for a Conditional Use or for a use subject to Site Plan 
Review may be issued by the Building Official only 
upon approval of the Conditional Use or Site Plan in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of this 
Article. 

3. Building Permit After an Appeal or a Request for a

§3-3. Site Plan Review.  

A. Purpose. The economy of Gulf Shores is dependent 
upon its continued appeal as a Beach resort community 
and its ability to attract tourists and other visitors. The 
community is located in a fragile coastal environment, 
which is highly sensitive to development pressures. 
Therefore, to ensure that the development of certain 
uses are properly guided, Site Plan Review shall take 
into account the following objectives:  

1. Future development must be harmonious with the 
beach resort character of the community; 

2. Future development must not adversely affect the 
City's physical infrastructure; 

3. Future development must be compatible with the 
natural environment; and,  

4. Future development must not be otherwise harmful to 
the health, safety, morals and general welfare of 
residents and visitors.

Review and approval through the Commission.  

3. For business and industrial related uses, Site Plan 
Review and approval through the Commission shall 
be required for all commercial Structures which have 
a GFA in excess of 2,500 sf and industrial Structures 
having a GFA in excess of 10,000 sf.  

4. For business and industrial related uses containing a 
GFA which is less than the minimums stated 
immediately above, an administrative Site Plan 
Review and approval through the CDD shall be 
required. The final decision of the CDD in performing 
this review shall rest with the Zoning Official. An 
applicant may choose at any time, via written request, 
to waive the CDD review process in favor of review 
and approval through the Commission.  

C. Submission Procedure. 

1. Prior Compliances and Approvals. An application for a 
Site Plan Review shall be made to the CDD prior to 
an application for a Building Permit.  

a. Except as otherwise required by law or 
administrative procedures, all required county, 
regional, state or federal agency approvals shall 
be obtained prior to the submission of an 
application for Site Plan Review. At his 
discretion, the Zoning Official may waive this 
requirement in whole or in part to allow the 
processing of permit applications at various 
other levels of government to proceed 
coincidentally with Site Plan Review. This 
permission must be obtained in writing from the 
Zoning Official and shall not prejudice the City's 
decisions in any way with regard to the 
standards of acceptance of the Site Plan 
Review.  

2. Staff Review. Upon receipt of a Site Plan application, 
the Zoning Official shall have ten (10) working days to 
determine the appropriateness and completeness of 
the information presented in the submission and 
accept or reject the application. This decision shall not 
be taken as approval or disapproval of the Site Plan 
itself. Within thirty (30) working days after receipt of a 
Site Plan Review application, the Zoning Official shall 
refer said application, together with all supporting 
documentation and staff recommendations, to the 
Commission for its review and recommendations. 

3. Consultants Review. The City may, if in its opinion it is 
necessary, retain consultants to assist in the review of 
an application for Site Plan Review. The cost of 
retaining said consultants shall be borne by the 
applicant. 

4. Planning Commission Review.  

a. Upon receipt of said application, the 
Commission shall within sixty (60) working days 
of the original acceptance date by the City 
review said Site Plan and: 1) approve it as 
submitted, 2) approve it subject to conditions, or 
3) disapprove it. The applicant may appeal the 
decision of the Commission to the Council in 
accord with §3-3G. 

5. Revision. The applicant may elect to revise his Site 
Plan submission at any time in the review process. He 
shall submit a letter of intent to revise to the Zoning 
Official who, upon receipt of the letter, will halt the 
normal review processing. Within fifteen (15) days 
after receiving revised documents, the Zoning Official 
will review the revisions and forward his comments 
and recommendations to the reviewing authority. 
Each of the reviewing bodies shall have thirty (30) 
working days to act on the revised Site Plan and the 
entire review process shall be similarly extended in 
time. 

6. Building Permit and Expiration of Site Plan.  

a. Upon Site Plan approval, the Building Official 
may, upon application, issue a Building Permit 
for a portion or all of the proposed development 
after he finds that the application is in 
compliance with all applicable City, County, 
State, and Federal requirements. 

b. If within two (2) years of the date of approval of 
an application for Site Plan Review, a Building 
Permit has not been obtained, the approved Site 
Plan becomes null and void. Site Plan shall also 
become null and void upon expiration of the 
Building Permit. 

c. Reauthorization Clause. Within 30 days 
following the prescribed expiration date, for 
good cause, the Planning Commission may 
reauthorize an expiring Site Plan a single time 
for a period not to exceed two (2) additional 
years.  

(1) The application process to reauthorize a Site 
Plan requires the submittal of a Site Plan 
application, the required Site Plan fee, and a 
narrative stating the reasons for the 
extension application. 

(2) If any changes have been made to City 
regulations, a new set of updated Site Plans 



 

 

 3-3 Article 3: Administration 

in accordance with current City regulations 
shall be submitted. 

(3) Submission Procedure: Site Plan 
reauthorization applications shall follow the 
submission procedure established in §3-3 
and the Planning Commission Meeting 
Calendar. 

d. Where any changes have occurred regarding 
the approved Site Plan or to the Zoning 
Ordinance or Map, which would make the 
approved Site Plan nonconforming, the 
previously approved Site Plan shall expire and a 
new Site Plan shall be submitted in accord with 
the provisions of this Section together with the 
required fee.  

7. Changes After Approval. 

a. Minor changes to an approved Site Plan may be 
authorized by the Zoning Official to overcome 
unanticipated hardships or conditions provided 
that such minor changes:  

(1) are not inconsistent with provisions of this 
Ordinance;  

(2) are not inconsistent with the design concept 
of the approved Site Plan;  

(3) do not add additional Stories in height;  

(4) do not add additional Dwelling Units.

Site Plan shall be submitted to the reviewing 
authority for approval.  

D. Public Hearing. A public hearing is not required during 
the Site Plan Review process.  

E. Findings. The granting or denial of approval by written 
Resolution of the reviewing authority shall include not 
only conclusions but also finding of fact related to the 
specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the 
grant, with or without changes and/or special conditions 
or for disapproval, and said Resolution shall set forth 
with particularity in what respects the plan would or 
would not be in the public interest including but not 
limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the 
following:  

1. In what respects the plan is or is not consistent with 
the Comprehensive Plan and the purpose and intent 
of the applicable district.  

2. In what respects the plan is or is not in conformance

good design standards in respect to all external 
relationships, including but not limited to: 

a. Relationship to Adjacent properties; 

b. Internal circulation, both vehicular and 
pedestrian;

in the proposed development and those on 
Abutting sites. 

5. In what respects the plan is or is not in conformance 
with City policy in respect to sufficiency of ownership, 
guarantees for completion of all required 
Improvements and, if private, the guarantees for 
continued maintenance. 

F. Submission Requirements. Applications shall be 
accompanied by narratives, drawings, and other 
information as required by the CDD. The Zoning Official 
may waive submission requirements if, in his opinion, 
the requirements are not essential to a proper decision 
on the project or the Zoning Official may establish 
additional requirements for Site Plans to clarify the 
nature of proposed development. 

G. Appeals to the City Council. Applicants shall have no 
more than fifteen (15) working days in which to file an 
appeal to the Council regarding the decision of the 
Commission on a Site Plan application. The appeal shall 
be submitted in writing to the CDD and shall state the 
reasons for the appeal and the relief sought from the 
Commission’s decision.  A simple majority of vote of the 
Council members present, establishing a quorum for the 
meeting, is required to approve or deny an appeal or

issues related to the previous denial. This decision is at 
the sole discretion of the Zoning Official. 

F. Expiration. A CUP shall expire and become null and 
void if not acted upon within twelve (12) months from the 
date of issuance. The permit shall be deemed to have 
been “acted upon” when a completed application for a 
Building Permit (or Certificate of Occupancy where 
applicable) has been received by the Building 
Department in conjunction with the CUP. If said Building 
Permit expires (see §3-2D Expiration) at any time after 
the twelve (12) month period, the CUP shall be voided. 
A CUP shall also be deemed expired when the use for 
which the CUP was issued becomes inactive for a 
continuous period of twelve (12) months. See Building 
Permit and Expiration of Site Plan, §3-3C6.

changed in use and no associated land may be used 
until and unless the Building Official shall have issued 



 

 

 3-5 Article 3: Administration 

a Certificate of Occupancy upon completion of all 
construction and required site work. 

A. Upon written request of an owner or proposed occupant, 
and payment of a non-refundable processing fee of 
$100.00 or such other fee amount as may be fixed by 
resolution of the City Council from time to time, the 
Building Official with the prior approval of the Zoning 
Official may issue a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy 
for a Building or Structure on which construction or site 
work is still ongoing but is substantially completed to 
allow use or occupancy of the affected Building or 
Structure and site pending completion of all construction 
and required site work. Such Temporary Certificate of 
Occupancy, if issued, shall be valid only for the period of 
time specified in the Certificate but in no event for a 
period exceeding thirty (30) days for a detached 
residence and forty-five (45) days for any other 
Buildings or Structures. In addition to such other 
necessary or appropriate terms and conditions as may 
be imposed in such certificate by the Building Official 
and Zoning Official in their good faith discretion, each 
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued and 
conditioned on the written agreement of the owner or 
proposed occupant to the payment to the City of a fee 
as prescribed below, and all costs and expenses of 
collection in connection with such fee, for each day of 
use or occupancy of the Building, Structure, or site, if 
any, elapsing after expiration of the Temporary 
Certificate of Occupancy and before the issuance of a 
final Certificate of Occupancy.  

1. For each Single Family detached residence - $50.00 
per day 

2. For all other Buildings or Structures   - $100.00 per 
day  

B. Unless waived by resolution of the City Council, the 
owner or proposed occupant shall deposit with the City 
at the time of issuance of the Temporary Certificate of 
Occupancy an additional amount in cash or other 
collected funds computed by multiplying the number of 
days for which the certificate will be valid by the 
appropriate daily fee rate specified above. Such deposit 
shall be applied by the City against any fee owing as a 
result of failure to secure a final Certificate of 
Occupancy or to discontinue all use and occupancy of 
the Building or Structure and associated site prior to the 
expiration of the Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. 
Any amounts not so applied shall be refunded at the 
time of issuance of a final Certificate of Occupancy. 

C. The fee provided for under this Subsection A is an 
administrative charge and not a penalty in lieu of the 
criminal penalties otherwise provided for violation of this 
Ordinance under §3-9 Enforcement. Each day of use or 
occupancy of a Building, Structure, or site after 
expiration of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy and 

before issuance of a final Certificate of Occupancy shall 
be subject both to the assessment of the administrative 
fees provided in this Subsection A and to the criminal 
penalties provided under §3-9 Enforcement. 

§3-6. Zoning Amendments. 

A. Procedure for Initiation. The Council may from time to 
time amend, supplement or repeal the provisions of this 
Ordinance or rezone land upon initiation in one of the 
following ways: a) on its own motion, b) on petition from 
property owner(s), or c) on recommendation of the 
Commission.  

Regardless of the source of the proposed change, 
the Commission must first prepare a preliminary 
report, hold a public hearing thereon, and submit a 
final report to the Council. 

B. Conditional Rezoning. Upon securing agreement with 
the applicable property owner and as a pre-condition to 
rezoning, the Council reserves the right to limit the uses 
permissible on a property being requested to be 
rezoned to that use(s) proposed in the rezoning 
application and any similar uses which the Council 
determines appropriate in accord with the 
Comprehensive Plan and other limitations as needed to 
protect the health, safety and welfare of the subject 
area. The conditions agreed to by the petitioning 
landowner(s) are then legally binding on both the 
landowner(s) and City, providing stability for the 
landowners’ investment interests. 

C. Additional Procedural Requirements for the Beach Area, 
Walking Area, and Lagoon Pass Overlay District. 
Petitions from property owners inside the Beach Area 
Overlay District, the Walking Area Overlay District, and 
the Lagoon Pass Overlay District shall be subject to the 
following additional requirements: 

1. A Traffic Impact Study is required for rezoning 
applications concerning developments with more than 
200 PM peak hour trips according to the most recent 
edition of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook. The 
scope and analysis of the Traffic Impact Study shall 
follow the procedures of the American Planning 
Association Planning Advisory Service Report 
Number 387, Traffic Impact Analysis and other 
requirements of the Department of Public Works. 

2. The rezoning petition shall demonstrate compliance of 
the site, if rezoned, with applicable requirements of 
Article 16, and shall be evaluated by the staff, 
Commission and Council as required in this Section. 
In addition, the consideration of the rezoning petition 
by the Council shall specifically evaluate the following 
additional factors: 

a. Satisfactory relationship and access of the site 
to the beach;

j. Consistency of the planned Building and site 
Improvements with the Envision Gulf Shores 
Master Plan and related design guidelines; and  

k. The degree to which the rezoning would be

and the opposing Front Lot Line. Such distance 
shall be measured along a straight line, which is at 
right angles to the axis of the Lot, and shall be 
measured at the Front Yard Setback Line. When a 
Lot abuts on a curved Thoroughfare, the Lot Width 
is determined using the arc length.

8. R-3 Residential/Limited-Density Multiple-family 
District. This district exists for the protection of 
areas that are, or are planned to be, developed for 
attached housing in central neighborhoods. 
Permitted densities are limited so that compatible 
relationships can be maintained between all 
Dwelling types. 

9. R-4 Residential/High-Density Multiple-family District. 
This district exists for the protection of areas that 
are, or are planned to be, developed for high-
Density attached housing in central locations within 
the community. Other uses compatible with 
relatively high residential densities are permitted. 

10. R-5 Residential/Manufactured Home and 
Recreational Vehicle Park District. This district 
exists to provide space at appropriate locations 
consistent with community objectives for the 
establishment of Manufactured Home Parks and 
Recreational Vehicle parks. 

11. BN Neighborhood Business District. This district is 
intended to provide a transitional Buffer between 
commercial or industrial activities and nearby 
residential neighborhoods. Non-residential uses are 
limited to those that can be compatible with the 
residential character of Adjacent neighborhoods.  

12. BG General Business District. This district is 
intended to provide locations for a specified range 
of retail businesses and services, offices, Hotels, 
Motels and other compatible uses serving 
community needs, where an attractive appearance 
of Buildings and their Premises is important to the 
successful conduct of business.  

13. BT Tourist Business Districts. These districts are 
intended to provide suitable locations for walkable, 
Mixed-use Developments consisting of Hotels, 
Motels, Condominiums, Multiple-family Dwellings 
and compatible Commercial Uses that provide 
residents and tourists with services, conveniences 
and amenities. There are five separately designated

District

14. BA Arterial Business District. This district is 
intended to provide locations for a variety of 
commercial and light industrial activities along the 
main entrance highway to the City and at other 
locations where similar development may occur. An 
attractive appearance along the highway is 
essential if the City is to maintain its tourist resort 
image and ensure the continuing vitality of its local 
economy. An attractive appearance is also essential 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance

to the successful operation of many commercial and 
industrial uses permitted within the BA District. 
Among the uses permitted, some require open 
sales Lots for the display of merchandise and others 
customarily store goods, materials, and equipment 
in open storage areas. Regulations for the District 
are intended to ensure that such open display areas 
or storage areas are Screened or landscaped so 
that they are compatible with other permitted uses 
and with the desired appearance of the City's main 
entrance highway. 

15. ATP Amusement/Theme Park District. This district 
is intended for major amusement and/or Theme 
Parks on land Parcels of twelve (12) acres or more, 
in locations where their operations are compatible 
with existing or planned surrounding development 
and where Thoroughfares can accommodate traffic 
generated. Regulations permit customary uses for 
such parks along with decorative Structures, signs, 
pennants, and other devices that are appropriate to 
identify themes and provide a feeling of pageantry. 
The use of such devices are regulated to prevent 
unsightliness or visual clutter along a public 
Thoroughfare. Through required Setbacks, Buffers 
and Screening, and by other means, the regulations 
minimize adverse impacts of noise and other 
nuisances on surrounding properties. 

16. ICW-N Intracoastal Waterway-North and ICW-S 
Intracoastal Waterway District-South. These 
districts are intended to create a unified and 
continuous development district, which emphasizes 
a maritime theme and which takes advantage of the 
natural beauty of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) 
and its potential appeal as a premier living and 
tourist destination. 

17. IND Industrial District. This district is intended to 
provide a suitable protected environment for 
manufacturing, research and wholesale 
establishments which are clean, quiet and free of 
hazardous or objectionable emissions, and 
generate little industrial traffic. Industrial parks are 
encouraged. This district is also intended to provide 
locations for manufacturing and processing 
industries, service industries, warehousing, or 
research and testing operations that, due to 
employment of heavy equipment or machinery or to 
the nature of the materials and processes involved, 
require special locations and development 
safeguards to prevent pollution of the environment 
by noise, vibration, odors or other factors. Such 
industries may require sites extensive in size and 
served by adequate utilities service and 
transportation. 

18. OS Open Space and Preservation District. This 
district is established to preserve and maintain 
lands for outdoor recreation, parks, and related 
activities, both public and private. This district may 
also be used to identify Alabama State lands 
intended to be preserved in their natural state. 

19. ED Education District. This district is designed and 
intended for primary, secondary, and/or advanced 
levels of education related facilities and curriculum 
supporting sustainable economic development by 
providing the City of Gulf Shores children quality 
education as well as providing our community with a 
perpetual and skilled workforce.

required by this Ordinance except as provided in this 
Ordinance; and if already less than the minimum 
required by this Ordinance, said area or dimension may 
be continued but shall not be further reduced. 

D. Buildings per Lot. 

1. Only one (1) Principal Building and its customary 
Accessory Building may hereafter be erected on any 
Lot in any R-1 or R-2 District except as otherwise 
provided in Article 15 Planned Unit Development.  

2. In all other districts multiple Principal Buildings per lot 
are allowed.  Minimum Building Spacing between 
buildings on the same lot shall be in accord with the 
Building and Fire Codes. 

3. For the purposes of this Section, a Principal Building 
is considered to be enclosed by a continuous wall on 
all sides. Joining two such Buildings with a walkway, 
which is open on one or more sides, is permitted only 
when the two opposite walls joined by such walkway 
are separated as required within this Ordinance. 

4. Where there are two or more Buildings permitted per 
Lot, each Building shall be directly accessible from a 
public Thoroughfare or from an unobstructed fire lane. 

E. Required Lot Width and Lot Frontage. The minimum Lot 
Width of any Lot shall be measured along the Front 
Setback Line and in no case shall the minimum Lot 
Frontage (see Figure 6-2E) be less than forty (40) ft 
except as follows: 

1. Minimum Lot Frontage for Townhouses: 20 ft 

2. Minimum Lot Frontage for Lots on Cul-de-Sacs: 25 ft

two (2) ft into Setbacks if they do not comprise more 
than twenty (25) percent of the surface of the Building 
face in question. 

Encroachments into Waterfront Setbacks up to 
two (2) ft may be permitted for eaves, cornices, 
downspouts, gutters, handrails, steps, or 
architectural embellishments if they do not 
comprise more than twenty-five (25) percent of the 
length of the Building face in question. No part of 
balconies, Accessory Uses, swimming pools, 
parking lots, and signs shall encroach into a 
Waterfront Setback.

c. Roof overhangs, not to exceed a projection into 
a Required Yard of more than three (3) feet but 
in no case projecting across any Adjacent 
property line. 

d. Bay windows, chimneys, window air condition 
units and similar architectural features or 
mechanical components of Single Family and 
Duplex Structures projecting no more than two 
(2) ft into a Required Yard. The cumulative 
width(s) of such encroachments shall not 
constitute more than ten (10) percent of the total

Structures. 

C. Side Yards. 

1. Single-family and Duplex Lots. Where a Side Yard 
contains a Driveway passing between a Structure and 



 

 

 6-3 Article 6: Supplementary Regulations 

an interior Side Lot Line, the Setback for the affected 
Side Yard shall be no less than twelve (12) ft. 

2. Non-residential Districts. To encourage a compact 
walkable development pattern, Side Yards are 
generally not required. Instead, Structures may be 
built to their Side Lot Lines, subject to adequate fire 
separation from Abutting development in accord with 
the Building and Fire Code. However, where 
Structures are set back from a Side Lot Line, they 
shall be set back no less than ten (10) ft. Where a 
developing use abuts a use to which it may be 
objectionable, pursuant to §12-3 Buffers, a Buffer 
shall be provided accordingly. 

D. Gulfside Yard. Every Lot Abutting the Gulf of Mexico 
shall have, on the Gulf side, a Gulfside Yard. The 
seaward edge of the Gulfside Yard shall be the Mean 
High Tide Line. The landward edge of the Gulfside Yard 
shall be the Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL) 
established by the City, which is on file in the office of 
the Building Official. The Gulfside Yard shall extend the 
full width of the Lot. No Structure, including Beach 
Shelters, Building, swimming pool, drive, vehicular 
parking, bulkhead, wall or fence except for sand fencing 
and Dune Walkovers, may be built within the required 
Gulfside Yard. 

E. Yards of Corner Lots. Standard Corner Lots of Single 
Family and Duplex uses shall be considered to have a 
Front Yard and a Street Side Yard, as defined in Article 
4. The Setback for each shall be as required in the 
Applicable District. All other Corner Lots shall be 
considered to have two Front Yards with the Setbacks 
for both as required in the Applicable District. See 
Figure 6-3E below. 

 

Figure 6-3E Yards of Corner Lots 

F. Yards of Through Lots. On Through Lots, the required 
Front Yard shall be provided on each Street Frontage 
except where a note appears on a recorded plat 
restricting access to one of the Abutting Thoroughfares. 
In such case, the required Rear Yard shall be the 
minimum as required by the applicable district. 

G. Exceptions and Modifications. 

1. Reduced Front Yard. A required Front Yard may be 
reduced where the average Setback of existing 
Buildings within 200 ft on either side of a proposed 
Building Lot, and within the same Block, is less than 
the required minimum Front Yard (see Figure 6-3G1). 
In such case, the Setback on the proposed Building 
Lot may be less than the required Front Yard depth, 
but not less than the average of the existing Setbacks 
on the aforementioned Lots, except that in no case 
shall a Building project beyond the average Front 
Yard of the two Adjacent Buildings on either side of 
the Lot in question. 

 

Figure 6-3G1 Reduced Front Yard 

2. Contextual Setbacks. Wherever a Block Frontage 
includes multiple zoning districts, the minimum Front 
Yard Setback for all Lots along the frontage shall be 
the most restrictive Front Yard Setback required by 
the districts occurring along that frontage (see Figure 
6-3G2, Example 1). This shall be considered the 
Contextual Setback. However, in the case of a 
frontage wherein a district with a greater minimum 
Front Yard Setback is separated from a district with a 
lesser minimum Front Yard Setback by an Alley, 
watercourse, Buffer, or similar physical transition, the 
Contextual Setback within the latter district shall be 
half (1/2) of the Setback required in the former district 
or the normally required Setback of the latter district, 
whichever is greater (see Figure 6-3G2, Example 2). 
These provisions shall also apply to Street Side Yards 
in the case of Standard Corner Lots. 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

6-4 

 
Example 1: Where the Lots along Frontage A are in a district with 
more restrictive Setbacks than those Lots along Frontage B, the 
Setback along Frontage C for Lot 1 is subject to the more restrictive 
Setback, except as shown in Example 2. 

 
Example 2: Where the Lots along Frontage A and those along 
Frontage B are separated by a public Alley ROW, the “Contextual 
Setback” along Frontage C for Lot 1 shall be the greater of: the 
normal Setback of the Applicable District or half of the Setback in 
the Abutting residential district. 

Figure 6-3G2: Contextual Setbacks 

3. Front and Rear Yard Reductions for Canal and Other 
Lots. Lots of record existing on the effective date of 
this Ordinance and located within residential districts, 
in an area bounded on the north by Little Lagoon, on 
the east by State Hwy. 59, on the south by West 2nd 
Ave. (extended), and on the west by West 6th St. 
(extended), shall have their required Front and Rear 
Yards reduced to a minimum of twenty-five (25) ft. If 
such Lots back on a canal or Waterway, other than 
Little Lagoon, and have Lot Depths of less than 85 ft, 
their required Rear Yards may be further reduced one 
(1) ft in depth for each one (1) ft of Lot Depth less 
than eighty-five (85) ft provided that no Rear Yard 
shall have a depth of less than ten (10) ft. In the case 
of all Lots within Block G-2 of the Re-subdivision of 
Unit One, Gulf Shores, as recorded in Map Book 3, 
Page 57, where said Lots are located along the north 
side of Stanton Creek, no Rear Yard shall be required 

and Structures may abut the unopened ROW of West 
2nd Ave. North. 

4. Rear Yard Setback Reduction for Lots on the 
Intracoastal Waterway. Residential Lots whose Rear 
Lot Line abuts the Corps ROW Line on the 
Intracoastal Waterway shall have their required Rear 
Yard Setback reduced to a minimum of fifteen (15) ft. 
Single Family residential Lots whose Rear Lot Lines 
abut the Corps ROW Line on the Intracoastal 
Waterway shall be allowed to increase maximum 
Building Coverage to thirty (30) percent only when the 
Principal Structure is constructed at the minimum 
fifteen (15) ft Rear Setback line as provided for herein. 

H. Construction Setback Line for Major Thoroughfares. 
Pursuant to the provisions of Act 94-572 (Acts of 
Alabama), there is hereby established a Construction 
Setback Line (CSL) for all properties fronting on a 
Thoroughfare listed in Table 6-3. The minimum Front 
Setback for properties Adjacent to these Thoroughfares, 
for all permanent Structures and/or required site 
Improvements including Landscaping and parking, shall 
be measured from the centerline of the existing ROW 
the distance specified in Table 6-3.

Motels, may be constructed up to a maximum height 
of six (6) ft within a required Front Yard, provided that 
the approving authority finds, after review of the 
development plan, that such walls or fences will not 
adversely impact any Abutting properties. In addition, 
such walls or fences shall be allowed where a 
subdivision borders on or contains an existing or 
proposed Arterial or Collector when such Structures 
are located between the Thoroughfare and the Rear 
Lot Line of a Through Lot or between the 
Thoroughfare and the Front or Street Side Lot Line of 
a Corner Lot situated directly Adjacent to such Arterial 
or Collector.

located on the site. In no case, however, shall an 
Accessory Use be required to be less than fifteen (15) 
ft in height nor allowed to exceed thirty-five (35) feet in 
height. The intent of this regulation is to allow 
Accessory Uses with an appropriate proportional 
relationship to the Adjacent Principal Structure(s) on 
the site. 

4. Buildings, which are Accessory to a Principal Use 
located on the landward side of a zone Lot created 
under the provisions of §6-8 Joinder of Lots, may be

may be allowed by Conditional Use Permit. The only 
utilities which may be provided to pier and wharf 
Structures are electricity and water and all pier 
Structures shall be constructed in such a manner which 
complies with §6-6H above. 

§6-7. Temporary Buildings and Uses.  

A. Temporary Buildings. 

1. No portable Building, tent, Dwelling Unit, Recreational

 6-9 Article 6: Supplementary Regulations 

(3) Color photos or drawings of the temporary 
sales Building identifying exterior materials 
and colors to be used. 

(4) All proposed signage relating to the 
temporary sales Building and sales activity, 
whether or not attached to the Building. 

3. Construction trailers associated with an approved 
development shall be reviewed and approved by the 
Building Official. Construction trailers shall generally 
be removed upon receipt of a Certificate of 
Occupancy or as otherwise approved by the Zoning 
Official. 

4. The Council shall have the right and the power to 
grant special temporary permits for periods not to 
exceed six (6) months, for the location and use on any 
Lot in any zoning district of a temporary Building, 
subject to such terms, conditions or special limitations 
as the Council may prescribe or impose. The Council 
may renew or extend any such special permit for up to 
twelve (12) months. The combined term of force for 
any such special permit and the renewal or extension 
thereof shall, in no event, exceed eighteen (18) 
months. It is the intent of this section to provide for 
flexibility of land use in community reorganization 
during periods immediately following natural disasters 
such as floods, hurricanes, fires, or other disasters, or 
such other emergency purposes as may be 
proclaimed by the Council. 

5. All other uses of portable Buildings shall be temporary 
in nature and shall only be approved through a 
temporary permit by the Council.  

§6-8. Joinder of Lots. 

A. Unity of Title Declaration. Wherever it is necessary that 
two or more Lots or portions thereof be added or joined, 
in whole or in part, to meet minimum Lot Area of 
dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, or when a 
Structure is proposed for erection across a Lot Line, the 
application for Building Permit shall be accompanied by 
evidence of recording a Unity of Title Declaration as 
herein described, in the public records of Baldwin 
County, Alabama. The filing of a copy of the recorded 
unity of title declaration is a prerequisite to final approval 
of the application and the issuance of a Building Permit. 
Land joined pursuant to the provisions of this section 
shall be known as a "zone Lot" which shall remain 
indivisible except as otherwise provided in this Section. 

B. Zone Lot to be Indivisible. A Unity of Title Declaration 
shall state unequivocally that the entire property created 
by a combination of recorded Lots or portions thereof 
shall be regarded as unified under one title as an 
indivisible Building site; that the said property shall be 
henceforth considered as one Lot and that no portion 
thereof shall be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or 

devised separately except in its entirety as one Lot or 
Parcel of land. The sale, assignment, transfer, 
conveyance or devise of a Condominium Parcel created 
by a recorded declaration of Condominium subjecting 
the same property to the Condominium form of 
ownership shall not be deemed a breach of the Unity of 
Title Declaration; however, the entire property shall 
continue to be regarded as unified and as a single 
Building site for all applicable code purposes. The 
parties to the declaration shall agree that the declaration 
of unity of title shall constitute a covenant to run with the 
land, as provided by law, and shall be binding upon the 
parties thereto, their successors and assigns, and all 
parties claiming under them until such time as the 
declaration may be released, in writing, by the Zoning 
Official. The Zoning Official is authorized to release a 
unity of title declaration when such declaration is no 
longer necessary due to the discontinuance or 
abandonment of the proposed construction giving rise to 
its issuance, and may approve changes or amendments 
to a Unity of Title Declaration when necessary to correct 
errors, mistakes or changes in circumstances. 

§6-9. Water Access. 

A. New water access from a Multiple-family Structure 
(Condominium or Hotel) shall not be provided through 
any  R-1 or R-2 District. Water access provided through 
similar zoned properties may be approved through the 
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) process. 

B. Water access in R-1 or R-2 Districts shall only provide 
access for an individual Single-family or Duplex 
Dwelling. 

C. Sites with existing water access as of December 2005 
may continue to use such access. The redevelopment of 
such sites, which increases the number of Dwelling 
Units, shall render the water access unusable and 
prohibit the continued use thereof. 

§6-10. Sight Distance Requirements. 

No planting, fence, Building, wall, sign or other 
Structure shall be placed or maintained after the 
effective date of this Ordinance, if such planting or 
Structure thereby obstructs vision at any point 
between a height of two and one half (2-1/2) ft and a 
height of eight (8) ft above the upper face of the 
nearest curb (or Grade Level at the Thoroughfare 
center line if no curb exists) and within the Sight 
Triangle as shown in Figure 6-11A and Figure 6-11B 
meeting the required Intersection Sight Distance as 
designated in Table 6-11.

§6-11. Access Standards. 

All subdivisions and all Multiple-family, Mixed-Use and 
Non-residential developments, redevelopments and 
changes in use shall be subject to the Access 
Management Standards adopted by the City and as 
herein described. Accesses existing, as of the 
effective date of these standards, shall be approved 
for the existing use only. Access, under these 
standards, shall be approved only for the use being 
proposed and as specified in a required Access Plan. 
Changes in use that would increase traffic or change 
the type of vehicles accessing the site shall require a 
new approval of access. When a site, existing at the 
time of these standards, is redeveloped in a manner 
so as to create a Significant Increase in Trip 
Generation, as defined in Article 4, all existing 
Driveways shall be brought into conformity with these 
standards. 

§6-12. Outdoor Lighting Standards. 

A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is 
to ensure that all exterior lights and Illuminated Signs 
are designed, located, installed and directed in such a 
manner as to prevent objectionable Light Trespass and 
Glare across property lines, and/or Direct Glare at any 
location on or off the subject property. The “maintained 
Horizontal Luminance recommendation” set by the 
Illuminating Engineers Society of North America 
(IESNA) as shown in Appendix C of City Ordinance 
1461 shall be observed. 

B. Applicability. Except as provided in §6-12E below, this 
Section shall apply to the installation of new outdoor 
lighting fixtures or the replacement of existing outdoor 
fixtures outside the Marine Turtle Conservation Zone. 
Outdoor lighting within the Marine Turtle Conservation 
Zones shall be in accord with §6-12G. 

1. Replacement of a fixture shall mean a change of 
fixture type or change to the mounting height or 
location of the fixture. Routine lighting fixture 
maintenance, such as changing lamps or light bulbs, 
ballast, housing, lenses and other similar 
components, shall not constitute replacement and 
shall be permitted provided such changes do not 
result in a higher lumen output. 

2. Outdoor lighting installations lawfully existing prior to 
effective date of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be 
lawful nonconformities and may remain. A 
nonconforming lighting fixture that is changed to or 
replaced by a conforming lighting fixture shall not 
thereafter be changed to conflict with this Section. 

3. Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the 
provisions of this Section:

a. For Buildings that contain fewer than five (5) 
Habitable Stories, maximum FAR applies to all 
occupied Building areas that are heated and 
cooled. 

b. For Buildings that contain five (5) or more 
Habitable Stories, maximum FAR applies to all 
heated and cooled Building areas used for 
residential or Lodging. 

c. Parking levels excluded from Building Height 
determination in §8-5B1 are also excluded from 
calculation of FAR. 

d. When a Mixed-use Building in which the 
predominant use is Multiple-family residential, 
Interval Occupancy, or Hotel, Building areas 
devoted to business, entertainment and similar 
uses are excluded from the calculation of FAR 
provided that they are directly accessible to 
sidewalks on surrounding streets. 

e. Maximum FAR may be exceeded for projects for 
which bonus Density, GFA and/or height is 
awarded pursuant to §10-3 Walking Area 
Overlay District, §10-4 Lagoon Pass Overlay 
District, or §10-5 Beach Area Overlay District. 

7. Maximum Building Coverage. The maximum Building 
Coverage percentages in Table 8-5B apply only to the 
corresponding floors as shown in the table. 

8. Modifications in the BT-1 FM District. Uses shall be 
subject to the area and dimensional requirements of 
the BT-1 District as shown in Table 8-5B except 
where modified by Table 8-5C and as provided 
herein. 

a. Existing Lots between 6,000 sf and 9,000 sf are

than twenty-five (25) percent of the length of the 
Building face in question. No part of balconies, 
Accessory Uses, swimming pools, parking lots, 
and signs shall encroach into the Waterfront 

Setback. Where the required Waterfront 
Setback is greater than the required Front Yard, 
Side Yard or Rear Yard Setback, the Waterfront 
Setback shall govern.  

c. Waterfront Setback options. For gulf-front Lots, 
the Waterfront Setback is the CCCL. For all 
other Lots, the following Setback options are 
permitted: 

(1) Option 1: Fifty (50) ft from Mean High Tide

Side Yard of ten (10) ft on each side for 
Buildings up to twenty (20) ft in height. The 
minimum Side Yard, applicable to the Building in 
its entirety, shall be increased by two (2) ft for 
each additional ten (10) ft in height. In no case 
shall this require a minimum Side Yard of more 
than thirty (30) ft; however, this shall not limit 
any Buffer required by §12-3 Buffers.

§9-2. Intracoastal Waterway Districts.  

Intracoastal Waterway Districts include the ICW-N and 
ICW-S Districts and shall be developed in accord with 
the objectives and general regulations in Subsections 
A and B following. 

A. Objectives. Within the Intracoastal Waterway Districts, 
the City intends to: 

1. Encourage urban scale waterfront development that 
facilitates walking and pedestrian interaction between 
neighboring uses. 

2. Encourage a logical arrangement of innovative high 
quality “Mixed-use” developments that include 
residential, commercial, Marina, and tourist uses. 

3. Establish a common maritime theme for all waterfront 
development. 

4. Establish developmental guidelines and land use 
patterns that serve to preserve property values and 
enhance the quality of life for residents of both the 
north and south banks of the Intracoastal Waterway. 

5. Lessen the potential impact of north bank 
development on the residential properties located 
along the south bank of the Waterway by regulating 
both Building Heights and Building Setbacks from the 
north bank of the Intracoastal Waterway. 

6. Enhance streetscape treatments along Waterway 
West Blvd., E. 28th and 29th Ave., E. 2nd St., and 
Waterway East Blvd. in order to encourage new 
business development and to encourage the 
redevelopment of existing sites. 

7. Encourage the creation of a linear Greenway along 
the Intracoastal Waterway for the purpose of 
preserving its environmental and aesthetic qualities 
and to encourage active public interaction with this 
important waterfront asset. 

B. General Regulations and Area and Dimensional 
Modifications for ICW-N and ICW-S Districts. 

1. Modifications to the Setbacks required by this 
Ordinance may be approved by the approving 
authority when it is clearly demonstrated that the 
modification is in the best interest of the City, 
enhances the functionality and aesthetics of the 
project and would not cause an adverse impact upon 
Adjacent properties.  

2. In no case will any Structure or appurtenances thereto 
be permitted to violate any provision of the FAA-FAR 
Part 77 and/or Ordinance 831, as amended. All 
Structures greater than fifty (50) ft in height shall be 
required to obtain an official determination from the 
FAA as to whether the Structure constitutes a hazard 

to air navigation and results in a detrimental effect on 
Jack Edwards Airport.  

3. All Buildings and parking facilities located upon the 
site shall be designed to ensure the free and safe flow 
of pedestrian and bicycle traffic both within and 
around the site. To this end, pedestrian and/or bicycle 
interconnections between Building sites shall be 
provided as an integral element of the overall 
development plan as well as pedestrian friendly 
amenities such as benches, pedestrian landings, 
drinking fountains, bicycle racks, pedestrian lighting, 
Open Space, etc.  

4. Pedestrian Improvements made within the Corps 
easement Adjacent to the Intracoastal Waterway that 
are consistent with the recommendations of the 
Comprehensive Plan and the intent of this Section 
may offset some or all of the customary on-site 
pedestrian Improvements if such Improvements are 
deemed by the City to be more desirable or 
advantageous. All such Improvements are subject to 
approval by the by the Corps.  

5. Each development shall plan for and construct their 
portion of a multi-use pathway of at least twelve (12) ft 
in width or as otherwise recommended by applicable 
AASHTO standards. The pathway shall be located 
within the Corps’ easement Adjacent to the ICW, or 
along the southern edge of the property where no 
easement exists, consistent with the 
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. The 
precise location of the pathway will be determined 
through the Site Plan Review process and it is 
recognized that for the purpose of maintaining 
continuity across a site, certain activities may require 
extreme realignments. Flexibility will also be allowed 
to address specific site issues, the natural 
characteristics of the property, and enjoyment of the 
Adjacent water resource. The design and materials 
used in the construction of the path should be 
consistent, to the extent necessary, to maintain a 
common theme throughout the path and illustrate the 
paths “public” nature. Enhancements and 
embellishments will be allowed Adjacent to the path to 
represent the different developments that the path 
passes through.  

6. All proposed development shall incorporate 
appropriate Buffering and Screening techniques to 
minimize the potential for incompatibility between 
Adjacent uses as may be required in §12-2 Screening 
and §12-3 Buffers.  

7. Lighting for all development shall incorporate design 
elements that shall prohibit the direct illumination of 
Adjacent property, ROW or the Intracoastal Waterway 
in accord with §6-12 Outdoor Lighting Standards.  



 

 

 9-3 Article 9: Special District Regulations 

8. Existing trees and vegetation located within unopened 
ROWs and the Corps easement shall be preserved to 
the extent practicable to provide for an appropriate 
Buffer and to improve the visual aesthetics of the 
property from the north. The removal of trees shall be 
allowed in accordance with the City Tree Preservation 
Ordinance.  

9. For determining FAR and Building Coverage, GFA 
shall:  

a. Include elevated parking floors and parking 
areas, such as decks and garages, contained 
entirely within the exterior faces of exterior walls 
and/or supporting columns of the Principal 
Building, when located on or above the second 
Habitable Story of a Structure; 

b. Exclude elevated parking floors and parking 
areas, such as decks and garages, to the extent 
contained within the exterior faces of exterior 
walls and/or supporting columns of the Principal 
Building, that are located on or below the first 
Habitable Story; and 

c. Include all elevated parking floors and parking 
areas, such as decks and garages, or portions 
thereof, that extend outward from the exterior 
faces of exterior walls and/or supporting 
columns of the Principal Building or that are 
detached from the Principal Building, whether 
covered or not. Ground level parking lots, above 
or below the base flood elevation (BFE), shall 
not be included in the calculation for the GFA; 
and 

d. Mean that area within the external limits of the 
“exterior faces of the exterior walls and/or 
supporting columns of the Principal Building,” 
including but not limited to: habitable space (i.e., 
guest rooms for rent or occupancy), elevator 
shafts, stairwells, common walkways, balconies, 
storage and mechanical rooms, and other 
related enclosed space. 

10. Outdoor activities, including but not limited to outdoor 
dining, are encouraged but are subject to approval 
through the Site Plan Review process. Consideration 
shall be given to proximity to residential development 
and zoning; the nature of the activity and noise levels 
related thereto; proposed hours of operation, and any 
other relevant factor.  

11. An engineer-certified Stormwater Management Plan is 
required for approval by the City. The Stormwater 
Management Plan shall indicate the specific Best 
Management Practices that would be required for 
collecting, filtering and pre-treating all stormwater 
runoff from the property prior to discharge in order to 
meet the standards of the state and federal 

governments, including National Pollution Discharge 
Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements. 

12. Other Regulations Applicable. Except as otherwise 
provided in this §9.3, the following general regulations 
shall also apply: 

a. Supplementary Regulations. See Article 6 for 
general regulations on Lots, Yards, Building 
Height, Accessory and portable Buildings, walls 
and fences, water access, access management, 
and sight distance. 

b. Outdoor Lighting. See §6-12 Outdoor Lighting 
Standards.

 10-1 Article 10: Overlay District Regulations 

ARTICLE 10: OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

§10-1. Intent: 

The purpose of an overlay district is to allow for the 
application of specific regulations to distinct 
geographic areas within the City. These geographic 
areas warrant special consideration due to their 
unique situations or prominent locations. Existing 
conditions and development are such that it is 
impractical to apply underlying zoning district 
regulations and achieve the goals of the City as 
established in the Future Land Use Plan.  
 
The effect of an overlay district will be to encourage 
property development which will maintain the unique 
characteristics of an area or create a new character of 
development as envisioned by the City’s Future Land 
Use Plan. It is the intent of this article to provide an 
instrument for establishing supplemental standards for 
overlay districts.  

 

§10-2. Procedure:  

A. General. The supplemental standards for Overlay 
Districts are pre-determined as set forth in this Article. 
Once these determinations have been incorporated into 
a plan, then projects shall be processed in accordance 
with the procedures of Article 3-3 Site Plan Review. 

B. Deviations. Deviations from strict compliance with 
underlying zoning and overlay district standards may be 
allowed if such deviations are found to comply with the 
goals and intent of the Future Land Use Plan. 
Applications requesting deviations from zoning 
standards shall follow the conditional Use Permit review 
and approval process (Article 3-4 Conditional Use 
Permit) (CUP) 

§10-3. Walking Area Overlay District. 

A. Use Regulations. See §8-5 for BT (1-5) Districts and the

 10-19 Article 10: Overlay District Regulations 

C. Organization 

The WV-O District is divided into 5 transect zones 
which stipulate specific regulations for certain areas 
of the WV-O District.  The transect zones are 
described and graphically displayed on the 
Regulating Plan Section 10-8F.  The regulations 
prescribed herein regulate the form, design, scale, 
intensity and performance of public spaces, building 
form and private parking standards to ensure that 
new developments exhibit the highest standards of 
urban design, architecture, and streetscape 
standards at the scale of the neighborhood, block, 
lot and building. 

1. Public Space Standards Public space standards 
address thoroughfares and green spaces.  
Thoroughfares are intended for use by vehicular, 
bicycle and pedestrian.   Thoroughfares generally 
consist of vehicular lanes and public frontages.  
Thoroughfares should be designed to be walkable 
with pedestrian comfort and safety as critical goals 
along with the safe and efficient flow of traffic, 
accommodations of emergency vehicles, parking, 
utilities and storm water. 

Green Spaces are intended primarily for 
pedestrians and bicyclists.  Refer to Section10-8 
Public Space Standards, for the Thoroughfare and 
Green Space Standards. 

2. Building Form Standards Building form standards 
consist of building placement, frontage types and 
architectural design guidelines.  Building placement 
relates to the scale of buildings in relation to lot size 
and dimensions (e.g. location and size of facades, 
required yard locations and size, setbacks, etc.)   
Refer to Section 10-8I & J, Building Form Standards, 
for building placement standards for each transect 
zone. 

Frontage is the specific way that a building or 
structure addresses a thoroughfare.  Frontage 
types combined with building placement 
strengthen urban character and support a 
pedestrian oriented environment.  Refer to Section 
10-8I and 10-8J Building Form Standards, for 
building frontage standards for each transect 
zone. 

Design guidelines are evaluation criteria of 
building massing and modulation, façade 
composition, fenestration, and architectural 
elements and detail.  Refer to Section 10-8I and 
10-8J Building Form Standards, for architectural 
design standards for each transect zone. 

 

3. Private Parking Placement.  Private parking 
placement standards establish performance 
measures for the type, number of spaces, and access 
to parking areas.  By regulating private parking, 
quality of place and walkable neighborhoods are 
achieved.  Refer to Section 10-8D 4, 10-8I and 10-8J 
for the Private Parking Standards for each transect 
zone. 

D. Applicability  

The provisions contained herein shall apply to all 
lands as identified on the Official City of Gulf Shores 
Zoning Map as being within the WV-O. 

1. Performance Regulations. The text standards, tables 
and figures are an integral part of the WV-O 
regulations.  The diagrams that accompany the text 
and tables should be considered guidelines and 
where in conflict, text and tables shall take 
precedence over graphic diagrams. 

2. Conflicting Provisions. The WV-O functions separately 
from the regulations of Zoning Ordinance.  Zoning 
Ordinance regulations are relied upon in limited and 
special circumstances as noted throughout the WV-O 
District.  Except where explicitly provided to the 
contrary, whenever the requirements of the WV-O 
regulations are at variance with the requirements of 
any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or 
ordinances, the requirements of the WV-O District 
shall govern. 

3. Maximum Density. Maximum Density shall be allowed 
pursuant to the underlying Zoning District or a 
maximum of 20 units per acre, whichever is greater.  
Mixed use developments shall be allowed a maximum 
10% bonus density above the standard requirements. 

4. Parking Standards. In an effort to promote compact 
pedestrian development the WV-O District is designed 
to provide extensive public parking and reduced on-
site parking for individual uses. Public parking 
facilities, mixed-use development, and shared parking 
between uses will allow a smaller parking supply meet 
the combined peak parking demands of the district. 
The following parking requirements apply in the WV-O 
District.  

a. Requirements 

(1)  Minimum parking space requirements shall 
be calculated at a rate of fifty percent (50%) 
of the standard rate as established by Article 
14 of the Zoning Ordinance. 

(2)  Maximum parking space requirements shall 
be calculated utilizing the standards as 
established by the Required Minimum Off-
street Parking Spaces Table in Article 14 of 
the Zoning Ordinance. 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

10-20 

(3) Restaurants, Lounges/Bars, and Lodging 
Uses, required parking spaces shall be 
calculated utilizing the minimum parking 
space standards established by the Required 
Minimum Off-street Parking Spaces Table in 
Article 14 of the Zoning Ordinance. A 
maximum 50% of parking spaces shall be 
constructed on-site. Minimum on-site parking 
shall be determined via the review process.  

On street parking spaces immediately 
adjacent to the frontage line shall be counted 
as required parking. 

b. On a case-by-case basis parking reductions 
may be allowed by the approving authority in 
accord with the following provisions or a 
combination thereof: 

(1)  Local Parking Demand Study.  In 
accordance with Article 14 or Table 14-2B of 
the Zoning Ordinance, reduced parking 
requirements supported by a parking demand 
study, may be approved if the parking 
demand study determines acceptable levels 
of parking exist within 750 feet of the subject 
site. 

(2) Public Parking Credits.  The approving 
authority may reduce the required parking 
spaces for all uses when public parking 
credits have been purchased from the City 
towards spaces in a public parking facility 
within 750 ft of the subject sit and in 
conformance with Article 14 of the Zoning 
Ordinance. 

5. Storm Water Management Standards. Due to the 
mixed-use infill development of the WV-O District, 
best management practices for stormwater 
management differ from suburban practices.  
Compact development creates fewer pollutants by 
reducing expansive lawns and parking lots.  This 
subsection allows the use of a variety of best 
management practices to meet stormwater 
management standards.  The use of these practices 
and their functional equivalents are presumed to 
comply with the stormwater management standards 
contained in Chapter 7, Article 5 of the Code of 
Ordinances Erosion and Sedimentation Control. 

Innovative and urban stormwater management 
designs and techniques may be considered for 
addressing stormwater treatment requirements, 
including but not limited to porous pavement, 
treatment inlet boxes with skimmers or traps, 
subsurface basins for infiltration or detention, 
prefabricated multi-chamber water quality devices, 
green roofs, stormwater treatment mitigation, rain 

gardens, bioswales, etc.  All stormwater 
management designs and techniques must be 
certified by an Alabama professional engineer or 
other appropriate professional who is competent 
in the fields of hydrology, drainage, and flood 
control. 

Drainage plan submittals shall include at a 
minimum the requirements of Chapter 7, Article 5 
of the Code of Ordinances Erosion and 
Sedimentation Control, a proposed maintenance 
schedule for each technique, identifying the timing 
of inspections and the maintenance activities that 
will be taken such as removing debris from inlet 
boxes, replacing filters, pumping out accumulated 
sediment, mechanical sweeping, etc. and any 
other submittal requirements of the Director of 
Public Works. 

Stormwater attenuation requirements may be 
waived for sites provided that post-development 
conditions do not exceed the maximum 
predevelopment discharge rate or whereby runoff 
retention/detention is part of a regional stormwater 
management facility.  This consideration is 
granted provided that the site provides stormwater 
treatment for 150 percent of the site and adequate 
downstream capacity exists for the proposed 
discharge rate when considered within the context 
of the total watershed discharge and its timing. 

6. Landscaping. The landscape, screening, and 
buffering provisions of Article 12 of the Zoning 
Ordinance do not apply to properties within the WV-O 
District with the exception of the following sections of 
the Zoning Ordinance. 

a. 12-1 E. Parking Lot Landscape Standards 

b. 12-1 G. Landscape Plan Submittal 
Requirements 

c. 12-1 H. Minimum Plant Specifications 

d. 12-1 K. Tree Credits, and 

e. 12-1 M. Tree Protection Methods 

7. Supplementary Regulations.  See Article 6 for 
supplementary regulations.  These regulations apply 
to the WV-O District unless waived by the approving 
authority. 

8. Outdoor Lighting.  See Article 6-12 Outdoor Lighting 
Standards 

9. Sign Regulations. See Article 18 

E. Use Regulations  

1. The allowable uses shall be determined by the 
underlying Zoning Districts with the following 
exceptions:

H. WV-0 DISTRICT REGULATING PLAN: 

 

 

 
1. Transect Zone Descriptions 

T5a Waterfront Commercial – The purpose of this 
zone is to build upon the historical working 
waterfront character and evolve and transform 
this district into a vibrant, pedestrian oriented 
area, which will serve as the social and 
recreational focal point for the neighborhood.  
Ground level businesses with residential lodging 
and offices above are the dominate use and the 
physical form is regulated to reflect the 
commercial waterfront character of this 
neighborhood. 

T5 Neighborhood Commercial  - The 
purpose of this zone is to preserve 
and enhance the existing character of 
locally serving retail and commercial 
uses along East 2nd Street.  The 
physical form varies to represent the 
mixed commercial use of the area with 
buildings broken down into separate 
volumes, designed to form part of a 
larger composition of the area.  
Shared on-street parking, 
thoroughfare landscape plantings and  
pedestrian and bicycle paths are used 
to re-enforce the pedestrian scale of 
this neighborhood. 

T4 Neighborhood General – The 
purpose of this zone is to evolve and 
transform this area into a multi-family 
district, with limited single family, 
duplex, mixed use, and live work uses 
to compliment, reinforce and transition 
from the commercial uses located 
along the Intracoastal Waterway and 
East 2nd Street.  The physical form 
shall be architecturally scaled 
buildings designed to complement the 
character of the nearby commercial 
areas and to add to the pedestrian 
oriented nature of the district. 

GS Green Space – The purpose of 
this zone is to develop a well designed 
and strategically placed open space 
system which function as an 
organizing element within the  

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood structure, provides 
access the outdoors, serves as public 
gathering places for members of the 
community, and are essential for 
health vibrant neighborhoods. 

SD Special District – Special Districts 
designations shall be assigned to an area that, by 
their intrinsic size, function, or form, cannot 
conform to the specific requirements of the above 
transect zones.  Special Districts are intended to 
comply with the general purpose and design of the 
WV-O District regulations. 

  

The regulating plan sets the standard for development in the WV-O District by regulating the shape and form of 
the build environment.  The transect zone designations are illustrated and described by the Regulating Plan.  
The zones are established to affect the desired intensity and building scale for specific areas.

 12-1 Article 12: Landscaping, Screening, Buffers 

ARTICLE 12: LANDSCAPING, SCREENING,      
BUFFERS 

§12-1. Landscaping.  

These regulations establish minimum standards for 
the provision, protection, installation and maintenance 
of landscape plantings. In some cases, minor 
deviations from the literal requirement of these 
provisions may be permitted as specified herein. 

A. Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all new 
Buildings and developments in all zoning districts, 
including: Multiple-family, commercial, industrial and 
Public Uses (not within a ROW), and new Collectors and 
Arterials within, or existing Thoroughfares Adjacent to, a 
new PUD, or subdivision. Single-family and Duplex uses 
(on an individual Lot or Parcel; i.e., not a Condominium) 
are exempt from the provisions of this Section. In the 
case of conflict with any other Section of this Ordinance, 
the more restrictive requirements shall prevail. 

B. General Requirements. 

1. Landscape Plans shall take into account the presence 
of existing vegetation and natural features. Unless 
determined by the approving authority to be 
unfeasible, existing trees shall be preserved and 
integrated into the landscape design. No Protected 
Tree may be cut down, or any Lot or Parcel cleared 
without the issuance of a permit from the City in 
accordance with Chapter 7, Article VIII, Tree 
Protection, of the Code of Ordinances. Preserved 
trees may be eligible for credits toward the planting 
requirements of this Ordinance. 

2. Unless otherwise approved by the City authority 
having the responsibility for Site Plan approval, the 
minimum Landscaping requirements for any Parcel or 
site, exclusive of street ROW, shall be as follows:  

a. Industrial Districts: 15% of the Developed Site  

b. All Other Districts: 20% of the Developed Site  

For the purposes of calculating the required 
percentage of a Lot that is required to be 
landscaped, the Lot Area of properties having 
Gulfside Yards shall be deemed to extend five (5) 
ft south of the CCCL. In no case shall the percent 
minimum landscape requirement listed above be 
reduced by more than five (5) percent.  

3. Properties having Gulfside Yards intersecting the 
CCCL shall provide a continuous five (5) ft deep 
landscape strip south of and Adjacent to the CCCL. 
Such landscape strip shall be credited towards the 
minimum percentage of such Lots that are required to 
be landscaped. Landscape materials shall be 
approved by the City from the Gulf Coast Plant List in 
Exhibit 5 of the Envision Gulf Shores Overlay Districts 

Design Guidelines or as otherwise approved by the 
City. 

4. All proposed Open Space configurations shall be 
subject to Site Plan approval, where applicable. Any 
part of a development site not approved or used for 
Buildings, parking, Driveways, sidewalks, etc., shall 
be landscaped, including Hardscape or Softscape, or 
returned to a natural or near-natural condition after 
development. This requirement may be modified by 
the approving authority where that portion of the site 
not developed will be developed at a future date. In 
such case, the City may place conditions on the 
approval to require appropriate maintenance of the 
undeveloped portion until such time that it is 
developed. 

5. Landscape treatment for plazas, roads, paths, service 
and parking areas shall be designed as an integral 
part of a coordinated landscape design for the entire 
project area. 

6. An automatic irrigation system shall be provided to all 
landscaped areas requiring water. This requirement 
may be modified by the reviewing authority where 
native, drought-tolerant vegetation is used. 

7. Landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular 
encroachment by the use of vertical curbing, wheel 
stops, or by placing plant materials away from the 
edge of the vehicular overhang area as needed to 
prevent damage to required plantings. If curbing or 
similar vertical barriers are used, inlets shall be 
provided to allow stormwater to drain into landscaping 
areas  

8. The perimeter landscape requirement for 
industrial/commercial sites with Outdoor Storage of 
materials or equipment within the IND District may be 
modified, reduced, or waived through the Site Plan 
Review process if properly Screened and Buffered in 
accord with §12-2 Screening and §12-3 Buffers. All 
other requirements of this Ordinance shall apply to 
industrial sites. 

9. Subject to approval by the appropriate State, County, 
or City authority, ROW Adjacent to development sites 
shall be suitably landscaped at the time of 
development. Areas disturbed by construction 
activities, whether on private property or within 
ROWs, and whether by private construction of work 
performed by public or private utility companies, shall 
be restored to pre-construction or better condition. 

10. Landscape materials within the required Clear Sight 
Triangle shall be maintained in accordance with §6-10 
Sight Distance Requirements so as to ensure 
unobstructed visibility for motorists. 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

12-2 

11. Landscape areas Adjacent to ROWs may include 
ground Berming and swales to enhance the 
appearance of landscaped areas. 

C. Common Area Landscaping. In any Multiple-family 
project within BN, R-3 or R-4, that portion of the site 
required to be developed as Open Space shall be 
landscaped as follows:  

1. One-half ( ½) tree per Dwelling Unit shall be provided 
within the Open Space area, exclusive of Street Trees 
and Perimeter Landscaping. A minimum of twenty-five 
(25) percent of required trees shall be large/Medium 
Trees. The number of trees may be adjusted by the 
approving authority. 

2. Active recreation areas shall not be used for any 
retention or drainage purpose. Active recreation areas 
shall contain amenities such as swimming pool, 
basketball court, playground, sports field, etc. 

3. Portions of Wetlands and other natural areas may be 
considered toward satisfying this requirement 
provided that they contain boardwalks, gazebos, and 
other Improvements conducive for passive recreation. 
Such Improvements shall be approved by all 
appropriate state or federal agencies. Such areas 
may at the City’s discretion be used for limited 
drainage or retention purposes so long as their 
suitability for passive recreation is preserved. 

D. Street Frontage Landscape Standards.  

1. Landscaping shall be provided along the Lot Frontage 
between the Thoroughfare and any Buildings, parking 
areas, Loading or storage areas in accordance with 
the following standards:  

a. All property subject to this Ordinance shall 
provide a minimum ten (10) ft planting strip on-
site, immediately Adjacent to any Thoroughfare 
ROW with the exception of properties Adjacent

Driveways and permitted freestanding signs. 
Any Driveway approved shall be perpendicular 
to the Thoroughfare ROW and is subject to all 
applicable City regulations.  

c. Unless otherwise approved through Site Plan 
approval, the minimum landscape Setbacks 
specified in Item 1a, above, shall be provided. In 
no case shall these requirements be reduced by 
more than fifty (50) percent through the Site 
Plan Review process, except where a zero-Lot 

Line development pattern is intended in accord 
with the Comprehensive Plan and wherein the 
Building is built to the Front Lot Line and/or 
public sidewalk. However, this exception shall 
only apply to those portions of the Street 
Frontage bounded by Building Façade. 

2. The following Landscaping planting schedule shall be 
required along all Thoroughfares: 

a. Required plantings shall be calculated at the 
rate of one (1) tree for every twenty-five (25) lf of 
Lot Frontage. Trees may be planted every 
twenty-five (25) ft or clustered, so long as the 
intent of the planting requirement for Screening 
is maintained. Excessive clustering may result in 
the need for additional tree plantings. Required 
tree plantings shall be divided evenly between 
large/medium and Small Trees. 

b. Shrubs with a minimum size as specified in this 
§12-1D shall be planted in appropriate numbers 
to complement the placement of trees, but in no 
case shall there be less than six (6) Shrubs per 
twenty (20) lf of Lot Frontage. When Adjacent to 
a vehicular area, Shrubs shall be spaced to 
create a continuous hedge. 

c. Street Trees and Shrubs should be chosen to 
provide variety in landscape materials, 
coloration and to accentuate seasonal changes. 
Plant material shall be indigenous to, or 
compatible with, the area and have 
demonstrated an ability to survive in the coastal 
Alabama climate (see Table 12-4 
Recommended and Prohibited Plants).  A 
minimum of two (2) different tree and three (3) 
Shrub species shall be planted within the 
landscape Setback. 

d. Palm trees meeting the minimum height 
specified in 12-1H. Minimum Plant 
Specifications shall be allowed if planted in

tree. All three (3) trees must be planted within a 
ten (10) ft. radius and have a minimum height of 
ten (10) ft.  

E. Parking Lot Landscape Standards. 

1. A minimum of ten (10) percent of all parking lots shall 
be landscaped, exclusive of Street Frontage and 
Perimeter Landscaping. Such Landscaping shall 
consist of landscape islands located within the parking 
lot and Building Foundation Landscaping. 

2. Required trees shall be planted within the parking lot. 
Fifty (50) percent of the required trees shall be a 
minimum of twelve (12) ft high. 



 

 

 12-3 Article 12: Landscaping, Screening, Buffers 

3. Parking Lot Landscape islands. Islands shall be 
installed at least every twelve (12) consecutive 
parking spaces; such islands shall be a minimum of 
nine (9) ft wide (including curbing) and a minimum of 
150 sf in area. Parking Lot islands for mature trees 
being preserved may require wider landscape islands. 
A minimum of one (1) tree shall be planted for every 
150 sf of Parking Lot Landscape island area. Each 
such island shall be suitably landscaped with a variety 
of plant materials including but not limited to Ground 
Covers, Shrubs, flowering plants, and Mulch. Islands 
shall be placed at the end of parking rows. 

4. All parking lots shall be separated from Adjacent 
residential uses or districts by a minimum five (5) ft 
landscaped strip planted with a minimum of one (1) 
large or medium evergreen tree per every twenty-five 
(25) lf (no clustering of trees is permitted). Designated 
"Buffer" trees and a minimum six (6) ft wall or fence 
may also be required. Where a buffer is required by 
§12-3, the more restrictive requirements shall apply. 

5. All parking lots shall be Screened from public 
Thoroughfares by walls, vegetative hedges or Berms, 
or a combination thereof, constructed at least three 
(3) ft above the Grade Level of the parking lot or 
Adjacent Thoroughfare, whichever is higher in 
elevation. Said Improvements shall not create a 
visibility hazard. 

6. Foundation Landscaping. Unless otherwise waived 
through Site Plan approval, a minimum three (3) ft 
wide landscape area shall be provided for the purpose 
of separating parking lots from Buildings, walls and 
fences.  

7. Palm trees meeting the minimum height specified in 
§12-1H Minimum Plant Specifications shall be allowed 
as parking lot trees if planted in clusters of three (3) 
for every one (1) Shade Tree. All three (3) trees shall 
be planted within a ten (10) ft radius and have a 
minimum height of ten (10) ft.  

8. Modifications to the spacing of parking lot islands as 
prescribed in §12-1E3 above may be approved 
through the Site Plan Review process by the 
approving authority, provided such adjustment will 
result in the preservation of a Protected Tree or trees 
that would otherwise not fall within a planned 
landscape area and the overall effect of the alteration 
will be to improve the aesthetic appearance of the 
project. 

F. Perimeter Landscape Standards. 

1. All Multiple-family, commercial and industrial sites 
shall provide a minimum five (5) ft wide landscape 
strip along all interior property boundaries unless a 
modification is approved by the reviewing authority. 
Where a buffer is required by §12-3, the more 

restrictive requirements shall apply. This area shall be 
landscaped with a minimum of one (1) tree and four 
(4) Shrubs per every twenty-five (25) lf.  

a. Trees should be equally chosen to represent, at 
a minimum, species from the Medium and Small 
Tree lists. The clustering of trees shall not be 
allowed. 

b. Modifications or waivers may be approved by 
the reviewing authority where a zero-Lot Line 
development pattern is intended in accord with 
the Comprehensive Plan and, similarly, where 
parking areas on Abutting Lots may be joined by 
cross-access, wherein the joined parking areas 
may be considered as one parking lot in 
meeting the requirements of this Subsection.  

(1) For parking areas located between the 
Building and Front Lot Line, the modification 
shall be the minimum necessary. 

(2) For parking areas located between the 
Building and Side or Rear Lot Lines, 
substantial modification or a complete waiver 
may be approved. 

G. Landscape Plan Submittal Requirements.

any drainage way. 

D. Design Requirements. The method of Screening, 
including height and materials, shall be that which is 
sufficient to visually screen the use. The minimum 
height needed is preferred. Fences, Berms, or 
Landscaping used for other purposes, but that are 
proposed as part of a required screen and that meet the 
requirements of this section, may count toward 
Screening requirements. The design of Screening shall 
be in accord with the following and as approved during 
any applicable review: 

1. Location of uses. Location on site should be the first 
consideration in Screening the uses listed in §12-2B 
above. The reviewing authority may lessen the 
requirements of this subsection, as applicable, where 
the location of the use to be Screened reduces its 
visibility to the public and to neighboring properties to 
which the use would be objectionable, by reason of 
views, noise, or odors. 

a. Uses requiring Screening, when co-located, 
may be Screened together. 

b. Uses that produce objectionable noise or odors 
shall be located so as to minimize such impacts 
to the public and Abutting properties.

percent of the fence surface, required as part of 
a Screen, shall be left open. The finished side of 
the fence shall face Abutting property. 

b. Where fences required for Screening are longer 
than fifty (50) ft in one direction, evergreen 
Landscaping shall be placed along the exterior 
side. Where such fences are longer than 100 ft 
in one direction, required Landscaping shall 

include both trees and Shrubs and the fence 
shall have columns of wood or masonry which 
project outward from the fence surface. Such 
columns shall be spaced no greater than fifty 
(50) ft oc. 

c. Fences located forward of the Front Building 
Line shall not exceed six (6) ft. Fences located 
in a required rear or Side Yard shall not exceed 
eight (8) ft in height. Fences used to screen 
service or Loading areas shall not exceed eight 
(8) ft in height, however, fences used to screen 
dumpsters shall be higher than the container. 

3. Berms. Berms shall be landscaped and stabilized to 
prevent erosion and shall be a minimum height of four 
(4) ft with a maximum slope of three to one (3:1). 
Berms in excess of four (4) ft shall have a maximum 
slope of four to one (4:1) measured from the Lot Line. 

4. Shrubs and trees. Except as herein provided, 
plantings installed toward Screening requirements 
shall be in accord with the general requirements and 
minimum planting specifications set forth in §12-1H 
Minimum Plant Specifications. Landscaping shall be 
maintained in accord with §12-1J Maintenance. 

a. Shrubs shall be evergreen and spaced no more 
than five (5) ft oc.  

b. Trees shall be evergreen and, when used in the 
absence of a fence, should have a low 
understory and/or be used in combination with 
Shrubs that together provide an effective 
Screen. 

c. Screening requirements for specific uses. 

d. Dumpsters, trash refuse, and recycling 
containers should not be located forward of the 
Front Building Line. Such containers shall be 
Screened by the combination of opaque fence 
or masonry wall and plant material on three (3) 
sides. Opaque gates, designed to complement 
the screen, shall be installed for access. 

e. For Restaurants, enclosures shall be sized, as 
needed, to accommodate the storage of grease 
containers. 

f. Mechanical equipment on roofs or on site shall 
not be visible from public ROWs or Adjacent 
properties and shall be totally Screened. The 
Screening of Building-mounted mechanical 
equipment shall be an integral component of the 
Building design. Mechanical equipment installed 
on site shall be adequately Screened by plant 
materials and/or fences and shall blend in with 
site Landscaping. 



 

 

 12-7 Article 12: Landscaping, Screening, Buffers

equipment, and similar sales Lots shall be 
Screened by providing Street Frontage and 
Perimeter Landscaping requirements, in accord 
with §12-1 Landscaping. 

h. Outdoor Storage, where permitted, shall be 
effectively controlled according to the following 
requirements: 

(1) Outdoor Storage areas are prohibited in 
required Front Yards. 

(2) Uncovered and unscreened areas used for 
storage of live, vegetative products shall be 
designated on the Site Plan. 

(3) Screening shall be a minimum of six (6) ft 
high or two (2) ft taller than the material or 
equipment to be Screened, whichever is 
greater. 

(4) Loading berths shall be within the Building or 
concealed by means of a Screening wall of 
material similar to and compatible with that of 
the Building. 

(5) No designated or required parking spaces, 
fire lanes, sidewalks, landscape areas, 
retention/detention areas, or traffic lanes 
shall be used for Outdoor Storage. 

i. Service areas, Loading docks, work Yards, and 
similar uses should be located to minimize their 
visibility to the public and to any Abutting 
properties to which such uses would be 
objectionable. Where their location is insufficient 
to effectively screen the use, required Screening 
shall be at least six (6) ft in height. 

§12-3. Buffers. 

Buffers shall be provided in accord with the 
requirements of Table 12-3 and as described in this 
Section. In cases where Buffers are required or 
deemed necessary for the protection and/or 
separation of uses on Abutting Lots, the following 
provisions shall constitute the minimum requirements 
for each unless otherwise specified by the reviewing 
authority in individual cases. For the purposes of this 
Section, “fences” and “walls” shall have the same 
meaning, but shall not include the term “retaining 
wall”. Where Buffers are not required by this Section, 
the landscape requirements per §12-1 Landscaping 
shall be provided. 

A. General Requirements. Except as otherwise provided 
herein, Buffers shall be required based on the 
developing use and the existing, abutting use, 
regardless of whether the concerned properties are in 
the same or different zoning districts. 

1. 100 percent of the applicable Buffer requirements 
shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, 
except when the new use is developed Abutting an 
existing more intensive use developed prior to the 
adoption of these standards and for which no Buffer is 
in place. In this case, the new use shall be 
responsible for providing a minimum of fifty (50) 
percent of the required Buffer width as follows: 

a. Required Yards, where corresponding with the 
Buffer area, may overlap and may be counted 
toward the Buffer width requirement. 

b. The developer shall preserve existing vegetation 
within the Buffer width, which may be credited 
towards the Buffer requirement, or replace such 
vegetation with equivalent Landscaping. 
Equivalency of replacement Landscaping, if 
existing vegetation is removed, shall be 
determined by the reviewing authority. 

2. Any required Buffer Abutting a park or Greenway may 
be reduced, if the property owner dedicates land to be 
set aside for all or part of the required Buffer width to 
the City as part of the park or Greenway. Such land 
dedication shall be deemed acceptable only upon 
approval of the City. 

3. Buffer requirements may be modified by the 
approving authority as follows: 

a. Whenever the proposed use abuts an existing 
(nonconforming) use on a property that is 
designated for another use within the 
Comprehensive Plan and is zoned accordingly 
with the Comprehensive Plan, the required 
Buffer may be modified to be consistent with the 
projected use of the neighboring land.  

b. If the use relationships between two (2) Abutting 
Lots changes so that a lesser Buffer would be 
required, the width of the previously provided 
Buffer may be reduced accordingly. 

c. If the required Buffer abuts a public Alley, up to 
one-half (1/2) of the Alley width may be counted 
toward the Buffer width requirement but the 
Landscaping requirements shall not be reduced. 

4. Whenever the proposed use abuts vacant land, Buffer 
requirements shall be based on the zoning of the 
Abutting property or the use projected by the 
Comprehensive Plan, whichever requires a lesser 
Buffer. When determining Buffer requirements based 
on the zoning or projected use of Abutting vacant 
land, the Zoning Official shall consider the range of 
possible future uses and base the requirement on the 
use(s) that require a lesser Buffer. 

When the proposed use and Abutting vacant land 
both lie in the same zoning district and such 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

12-8 

district permits uses of greater intensity or Density 
than the proposed use, the proposed 
development shall provide half of the Buffer width 
that would normally be required between the 
proposed use and the projected use of the vacant 
land. 

5. Golf courses, playfields, stables, swimming pools, 
tennis courts, and other recreational facilities; parking 
and other vehicular use areas; Buildings, dumpsters, 
and Outdoor Storage are prohibited in required 
Buffers. 

6. Where desirable, the approving authority may permit 
a Pedestrian Access Way through a required Buffer. 

B. Height Buffers. Wherever a developing site, within one 
district, abuts another district with a more restrictive 
height allowance, the development shall be subject to a 
Height Buffer as described herein: 

1. Along the Lot Line Abutting the district with the more 
restrictive height allowance, the subject Building or 
Structure shall be set back in accord with any required 
Side Yard or Buffer. At such distance from the 
applicable Lot Line, only a Building of such height as 
would be allowed in the Abutting district may be 
permitted except as provided in Item 2, below. (See 
Figure 12-3B) 

2. For each foot the Building, or portion thereof, is set 
back from the Required Yard or Buffer, the Building, 
or portion thereof, may be increased in height two (2) 
ft up to the maximum height allowed in the Applicable 
District. (See Figure 12-3B) 

3. For developments six (6) Stories or taller that abut a 
district whose maximum height is two (2) Stories or 
less, the Density of the required Buffer Landscaping 
shall be increased to that of the next more restrictive 
Buffer class (see Table 12-3) in addition to providing 
the additional height Buffer width as required herein. 

C. Design Requirements. 

1. Trees and Shrubs shall be evenly spaced in accord 
with the densities shown in Table 12-3.  

2. The Buffer width and Density of Shrubs may be 
reduced as shown in Table 12-3 when a fence is 
provided that meets the following standards: 

a. Fences shall be of masonry, ornamental metal, 
durable wood, or a combination thereof as 
approved by the reviewing authority. Untreated 
wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be 
permitted. No more than twenty-five (25) percent 
of the fence surface, required as a part of a 
Buffer, shall be left open. The finished side of 
the fence shall face Abutting property. 

b. Fences shall be a minimum of six (6) ft high and 
no taller than eight (8) ft. 

c. For fences longer than fifty (50) ft in one 
direction, evergreen Landscaping shall be 
placed along the exterior side. Where such 
fences are longer than 100 ft in one direction, 
required Landscaping shall include both trees 
and Shrubs and the fence shall have columns of 
wood or masonry which project outward from 
the fence surface. Such columns shall be 
spaced no greater than fifty (50) ft oc. 

 

 

 

Figure 12-3B: Height Buffers 

Example: A developing site is located within a district with a 
maximum Building Height of 50 ft. Along its west Lot Line, the site 
abuts a district with a 35 ft maximum Building Height. A Buffer of 25 
ft is required along its west Lot Line. Those portions of the Building 
set back 32.5 ft or more from the west Lot Line are allowed a 
maximum height of 50 ft (35 ft based on the Abutting district plus 15 
additional ft for those portions of the Building set back 7.5 ft from the 
required 25 ft Buffer). Even if the Building were set back further, it 
would not be allowed to exceed the 50 ft height limit of its own 
district. 

 
D. Planting Requirements. Required Landscaping materials 

(plantings, walls, fences, pavers, etc.) shall be installed 
before a Certificate of Occupancy may be approved. 
Except as herein provided, plantings installed toward 
Buffer requirements shall be in accord with the general 



 

 

 12-9 Article 12: Landscaping, Screening, Buffers 

requirements and minimum planting specifications set 
forth in §12-1H Minimum Plant Specifications.  

1. Existing natural vegetation, which meets, in whole or 
in part, Buffer planting requirements, may be applied 
toward the requirements of this Section. 

2. No less than seventy-five (75) percent of required 
Shrubs shall be evergreen. No more than twenty-five 
(25) percent of the required Shrubs may be 
deciduous.  

3. Stormwater Management and drainage controls 
required by the City Engineer shall be coordinated 
with Landscaping Improvements and integrated into 
the overall site design. 

4. Maintenance. Buffers shall be maintained in 
perpetuity by the owner in accord with the 
maintenance requirements set forth in §12-1J 
Maintenance. Failure to comply with these 
maintenance requirements shall constitute a violation 
of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the remedies 
and penalties provided in Article 3.

 13-1 Article 14: Parking Regulations 

ARTICLE 13: NONCONFORMITIES 

§13-1. Purpose and Scope. 

The purpose of this Article is to regulate and limit the 
development and continued existence of uses, 
Improvements and Structures, which do not conform 
to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.  

A. Continuance of Nonconformities. Any Nonconforming 
Use or Structure which otherwise lawfully exists and 
which has become nonconforming as a result of the 
adoption of this Ordinance, as a result of any 
subsequent reclassification of zoning districts or other 
amendment to this Ordinance, or as a result of 
subsequent annexation of the use or Structure into the 
corporate limits of the City may be continued or 
maintained only in accordance with the terms of this 
Article.  

B. Effective Date of Nonconformity. For purposes of this 
Article, the "effective date of nonconformity" shall mean 
the latest of (a) the effective date of the Zoning 
Ordinance, (b) the effective date of the amendment to 
the Zoning Ordinance which first rendered the Structure 
or use nonconforming, or (c) the effective date of 
annexation of the Structure or use into the corporate 
limits of the City. 

§13-2. Nonconforming Uses.  

A. Expansion of Nonconforming Use. A Nonconforming 
Use shall not be expanded or extended beyond the floor 
area or Lot Area that is occupied on the effective date of 
nonconformity. 

B. Nonconforming Use of Structures and Premises. Except 
as otherwise provided herein, the lawful Nonconforming 
Use of a Structure or Premises existing at the effective 
date of nonconformity may be continued thereafter, 
although such use does not conform to the provisions 
hereof. If no Structural Alterations, other than alterations 
permitted under §13-5 Alteration of Nonconforming 
Structures, are made, such Nonconforming Use may be 
changed to another Nonconforming Use of the same or 
a less nonconforming classification.  

1. Whenever a Nonconforming Use has been changed 
to a less Nonconforming Use or to a conforming use, 
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less 
conforming use or Nonconforming Use, respectively.  

2. The Nonconforming Use of a Structure may be 
hereafter extended throughout those parts of a 
Building, which were lawfully and manifestly arranged 
or designed for such use at the effective date of 
nonconformity. 

3. The Nonconforming Use of a Premises may be 
hereafter extended throughout those parts of a 
Premises, which were lawfully and manifestly 

arranged or improved for such use at the effective 
date of nonconformity. 

§13-3. Discontinuation of Nonconformities.  

A. Nonconforming Uses. If a Nonconforming Use is 
abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of 
one (1) year, then that use shall not be renewed or re-
established and any subsequent use of the Lot or 
Structure shall conform to the use regulations of the 
Applicable District.  

B. Nonconforming Improvements. In the event the use of a 
property, on which nonconforming Improvements exist, 
including but not limited to, parking areas, Driveways, 
lighting, sidewalks, Buffers and Screening, and other 
Landscaping, becomes discontinued for a continuous 
period of one (1) year, such nonconforming 
Improvements shall be brought into conformity with the 
applicable provisions of this Ordinance prior to the 
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or Business 
License. 

§13-4. Repair or Reconstruction of Nonconforming 
Structures. 

A. Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance. Ordinary repairs 
and maintenance may be made to a nonconforming 
Structure. 

B. Substantial Improvement. In this section, substantial 
improvement shall mean any combination of 
reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, 
where the permitted improvement equals or exceeds 
fifty (50) percent of the current market value of the 
structure before the “start of construction” of the 
improvement. 

C. Substantial Damage. In this section, substantial damage 
shall mean damage of any origin sustained by a 
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it 
before damaged condition would be equal or exceed 
fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure 
before the damage occurred.  

D. Reconstruction. 

1. If a nonconforming Structure is destroyed or damaged 
by any cause, and the cost of reconstructing the 
Structure to a condition comparable to its condition 
immediately prior to the destruction or damage does 
not exceed fifty (50) percent of the value of the entire 
Structure before the destruction or damage, then the 
Structure may be restored to a condition comparable 
to its nonconforming condition prior to the destruction 
or damage, provided that a Building Permit is secured 
and that reconstruction is started within one (1) year 
from the date of the destruction or damage, and such 
reconstruction is diligently pursued to completion. 
Under no circumstances may a nonconforming 
Structure be enlarged in any exterior dimension or be 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

13-2 

otherwise made nonconforming to a greater extent or 
in a differing manner in the process of repair or 
reconstruction under this subsection. 

2. If a nonconforming Structure is destroyed or 
damaged, and the cost of restoring the Structure to a 
condition comparable to its condition immediately 
prior to the destruction or damage exceeds fifty ( 50) 
percent of the value of the entire Structure before the 
destruction or damage, the Structure shall not be 
restored unless the Structure as restored, and the use 
thereof, will thereafter conform to all requirements of 
the zoning district and applicable flood zone 
requirements in which it is located and to all 
applicable requirements of the Alabama Coastal Area 
Management Plan. ABCDS.  

3. Savings Clause Applicable to Certain Nonconforming 
Condominiums.  Where a legal nonconforming 
building or structure is destroyed, it may be 
reconstructed or restored, subject to the following 
standards. 

a. A legal nonconforming building or structure 
damaged or destroyed by any natural disaster 
or phenomenon including a hurricane, tornado, 
storm, flood, fire, high water, wind-driven water, 
tidal wave, or other catastrophic event may be 
restored or repaired under this Subsection. 

b. A building permit for the repair or restoration 
shall be issued within five years of the date of 
the damage. 

c. These savings clause provisions shall be 
applicable only to legal nonconforming 
Condominium structures that are located within 
the Beach Overlay District, the Walking Area 
Overlay District, and Lagoon Pass Overlay 
District. 

d. The cost of restoring the damaged or destroyed 
structure must exceed fifty percent (50%) of the 
most current fair and reasonable market value 
of the structure before its damage. 

e. The damaged or destroyed structure may be 
reconstructed or restored only in a manner 
which recreates the same number of dwelling 
units or lodging units and the same gross floor 
area contained in the structure on the day 
before its damage or destruction. 

f. The reconstruction or restoration of a damaged 
or destroyed structure must in all other respects 
(setbacks, building height, building coverage, 
architectural design guidelines, and all other 
area and dimensional requirements of the 
Zoning Ordinance) be in compliance with all 
applicable provisions  of this title, and such 

reconstruction or restoration is subject to all 
applicable enacted federal, state, or local laws 
adopted to protect public health, safety and 
welfare including, but not limited to, building fire, 
plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes in 
place at the time of site plan approval 
application for reconstruction or restoration.           

E. Determining Value of Structures. For the purposes of 
this subsection, the value of an entire Structure before 
destruction or damage shall be determined as follows: 

1. The value of an entire Structure before destruction or 
damage shall be determined by the current market 
value. Market value means the value of the structure 
(as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), 
excluding the value of land as established by what the 
local real estate market will bear. Market value can be 
established by what independent certified appraisal; 
replacement cost depreciated by age of building 
(actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values.  

F. Documentation Required for Restoration. For the 
purposes of this subsection, the cost of restoring the 
Structure to a condition comparable to its 
nonconforming condition prior to the destruction or 
damage shall be determined as follows: 

1. At the time application for a Building Permit referable 
to the restoration work is made, the applicant shall 
submit, in addition to the documentation otherwise 
required for the issuance of a Building Permit, the 
following documentation: 

a. A certification by the licensed contractor or 
contractors who will be performing the 
restoration work, or if there is no contractor on 
the project, by the permit applicant that the cost 
of the restoration work described in the permit 
application will not exceed the cost declared in 
the permit application. 

b. A copy of all documentation relating to the 
market value of the Structure.  

2. The certified cost declaration contained in the permit 
application will be accepted as the cost of restoration 
unless the Building Official determines that such 
declaration is materially inconsistent with the market 
value. In such event, the Building Official shall 
prepare a written determination of the cost of 
restoration for purposes of this subsection specifying 
the basis on which such cost of restoration has been 
determined. 

3. In the event changes in the scope of the restoration 
work necessitated by the discovery of unanticipated 
damage elements or expense results in an increase in 
the cost of the restoration work after the submission of 
a certified cost declaration, a revised certified cost 



 

 

 13-3 Article 14: Parking Regulations 

declaration must be filed with the Building Official. If 
the Building Official determines on the basis of the 
revised certified cost declaration or on the basis of 
other information coming to his attention deemed 
reliable that the cost of the restoration work exceeds 
fifty (50) percent of the value of the entire Structure 
before destruction or damage, the Building Official 
shall order the suspension of any Building or other 
permits issued for the restoration work. 

§13-5. Alteration of Nonconforming Structures.  

A. Alteration or Enlargement. No alteration to or 
enlargement of a nonconforming Structure shall be 
allowed unless such modification conforms to the area 
and dimensional requirements for the Applicable District, 
except that at no time shall any such alteration or 
enlargement be allowed if the modification creates any 
other nonconformity with respect to these regulations. In 
addition, any such alteration or enlargement must be 
made in compliance with all other requirements of this 
Ordinance including specifically by without limitation 
Article 14 Off-street Parking and Loading and §3-3 Site 
Plan Review. 

B. Relocation. A nonconforming Structure shall not be

 14-5 Article 14: Parking Regulations 

ARTICLE 14: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

§14-1. Required Off-street Parking.  

At the time of: 1) erection of any new Building; 2) 
establishment of any new use; 3) enlargement, 
expansion, or increase in capacity of any Principal or 
Accessory Building or use; or 4) conversion of a site 
or Building from one type of use or occupancy to 
another, such that the change or action creates a new 
or increases the previously existing parking demand 
for the site, Building, or use according to this Article, 
the site shall be improved as necessary to meet all of 
the requirements herein; including, but not limited to, 
required parking spaces, paving, layout and 
dimensions.  

A. Amount of Off-street Parking Spaces 
Required/Permitted. 

1. Minimum required. The minimum parking ratios in 
Table 14-1B apply to each use on a site. The 
minimum parking shall be provided for every separate 

use on the site. In calculating minimum required 
parking, a fractional result shall be rounded down to 
the next whole number; however, when multiple uses 
are proposed on the same site, the fractional 
requirement for each use is added together prior to 
rounding. 

2. Maximum permitted. To prevent the unnecessary 
creation of Impervious Surfaces and to further support 
compact, pedestrian-oriented development, uses shall 
not provide more than 125 percent of the parking 
required as a minimum in Table 14-1B within surface 
parking areas. This limitation shall not apply when the 
additional spaces are located in a Parking Structure. 
Furthermore, surface parking provided in excess of 
the minimum required shall be of an impervious 
paving as approved in accordance with §14-1D6. 

For uses not specified, the Zoning Official shall 
determine the required parking based on the most 
similar use in the Table subject to the following. 

B. General Standards and Modifications. 

1. Location.  

a. Parking spaces for all uses or Structures shall 
be located on the same Lot with the Principal 
Use unless a Conditional Use Permit is 
approved for off-site parking. Remote Parking 
shall not be located more than 500 ft from the 
Lot on which the Principal Use to be served is 
located and the zoning classification of the 
property on which the Remote Parking is 
located shall be the same or a less restrictive 
classification. A written agreement assuring the 
continued availability of such off-site facilities 

shall be properly drawn and executed by the 
parties concerned, approved as to form by the 
City Attorney and shall be filed with the Building 
Permit application. 

b. Driveways shall be designed and located such 
that the necessary or desired parking space 
shall not extend into a public right-of-way nor 
obstruct a public sidewalk. 

c. For all residential uses, the keeping of 
recreational vehicles, boats and trailers for more 
than forty-eight (48) hours shall only be 
permitted behind the Front Building Line.  

2. Collective Provision of Parking Spaces. Two (2) or 
more Non-residential or mixed-uses may collectively 
provide Off-street Parking if the following conditions 
are met: 

a. Cumulative parking space requirements for Non-
Residential or Mixed-use occupancies may be 
reduced where it can be demonstrated that the 
peak requirements of several occupancies occur 
at different times. Such reductions may be 
considered by the approving authority if 
supported by parking demand study. 

3. On-street Parking. On-street public parking may be 
counted towards the required parking spaces for 
Abutting Non-residential uses. Only parking spaces 
fully contained within the Lot Frontage (as extended 
into the parking lane) may be counted. On-street 
Parking spaces that extend in front of two separate 
properties may not be counted toward either. 

4. Public Parking and Parking Credits. The Zoning 
Official may reduce the required parking for a Non-
residential or Mixed-use development when public 
parking credits have been purchased from the City 
toward spaces in a public parking facility within 500 ft 
of the subject use and in accord with the following:  

a. One and one-half (1.5) parking credits may be 
sold by the City per space in a public parking 
facility.  

b. The purchase of a parking credit does not 
reserve any parking space for purchasers, their 
employees or customers. The City shall have 
the right to charge individuals for use of public 
parking to assure turnover and maximize 
parking availability for the general public and for 
the uses that have purchased parking credits. 

c. The cost of a parking credit shall be established 
from time to time by the Council. Funds 
accumulated under the parking credit program 
are to be used by the City to create new or 
expand existing public parking facilities, and/or 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

14-6 

improve pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the 
area to support use of public parking.  

C. Permit. A parking area permit approved by the Public 
Works Director shall be required for any parking area. 

D. Design Standards and Improvement Requirements. 

1. Space Dimensions. Parking space dimensions shall 
comply with the provisions of Table 14-1D and as 
shown in Figure 14-1D1.  

a. Compact car spaces may be provided but shall 
not exceed a ratio of one (1) compact car space: 
three (3) standard spaces. Compact car spaces 
shall be a minimum size of eight (8) ft in width 
by sixteen (16) ft in depth. 

b. Handicapped spaces shall be provided as 
required by the Building Code. 

2. Parking Area Dimensions. The design and 
dimensions of the parking area shall be in accordance 
with Table 14-1D and as shown in Figure 14-D1.  

a. Up to two (2) ft of vehicle overhang over a wheel 
stop may count toward the required length of a 
parking space. However, in such cases, the City 
Engineer may require additional aisle width. 
Vehicle overhang shall not project over a Lot 
Line, public ROW, sidewalk, required 
landscaped area, or internal walkway. 

b. The City Engineer may prescribe such traffic 
markers and or signs as deemed necessary to 
safely and efficiently manage traffic flow. 
Parking spaces, except those serving Single-
family Dwellings and Duplexes, shall be 
demarcated with painted lines and/or signs or 
other markings accepted by the City Engineer. 
Stacking Spaces shall not be individually 
marked but instead shall be clearly demarcated 
to direct traffic, as necessary. 

 

 

 

Figure 14-1D1 (See also Table 14-1D) 

3. Landscaping. The design and appearance of parking 
areas are intended to be compatible with the beach 
resort character of the community. Toward this 
objective, Off-street Parking areas of six (6) or more 
parking spaces shall be subject to §12-1 
Landscaping. 

4. Dead End Parking. Driveways and areas for internal 
circulation for parking of vehicles shall be designed to 
provide for safe and convenient circulation within the 
site. All parking lots must provide flow-through 
Driveways and dead end parking is prohibited. Ten 



 

 

 14-7 Article 14: Parking Regulations 

(10) or less consecutive parking spaces shall not be 
considered dead end parking. 

In extenuating circumstances when all other 
design options have been exhausted, the City 
may approve a striped area measuring a minimum 
of fifteen (15) ft by the full length of the parking 
aisle to be used as a vehicular turnaround area. 
“No Parking” and “Tow Away Zone” signage must 
be provided in vehicular turnaround areas in order 
to discourage vehicular parking.  

5. Parking Lot lighting shall be provided within all parking 
lots and a lighting plan shall be provided by a qualified 
lighting provider. Light poles and fixtures shall be of 
the minimum height, type and number necessary to 
satisfactorily illuminate the parking lot. Lighting 
fixtures shall be designed to safely light parking areas 
without creating nuisance or hazardous situations for 
Adjacent property or Thoroughfares in accord with §6-
13 Outdoor Lighting Standards. An exemption to the 
lighting requirement may be approved by the Council 
if it is demonstrated by the applicant that the lighting 
of the parking lot is unnecessary or undesirable and 
that such an exemption will not create a safety 
problem. 

6. Paving Standards. All parking spaces, Driveways and 
maneuvering areas shall be paved with asphaltic 
concrete, concrete, paving stone or masonry in 
compliance with standards adopted by the City 
Engineer. However, alternative paving may be 
approved pursuant to Paragraph 7 following. Required 
parking spaces shall be permanently marked and 
maintained and shall be accessible from a Driveway 
or aisle such that all vehicles approach the adjoining 
Thoroughfare in a forward motion. Restrictions and 
exceptions include: 

a. Detached Single-family Dwellings and Duplexes 
may substitute a ribbon-type Driveway (see 
Figure 141D6) or an unpaved all-weather 
surface, in compliance with standards adopted 
by the City Engineer, in place of a solid-paved 
surface. Vehicles may approach a Thoroughfare 
in either a forward or backing motion. This shall 
not apply to shared Driveways serving more 
than one such residences. 

 

Figure 14-1D6: Solid-paved and Ribbon Driveways 

b. All Driveways that cross an existing sidewalk or 
bike path shall be paved from the edge of 
pavement of the Thoroughfare to at least ten 
(10) ft from the back of the sidewalk or path, 
regardless of whether the parking on-site is 
required to be paved or not. See Figure 141D6. 
Ribbon-type Driveways shall be solid-paved 
from the back of sidewalk to the edge-of-
pavement. 

c. In addition to Item b, above, all uses, whether 
required to provide paved parking or an 
unpaved all-weather surface, shall be required 
to pave all turn-outs and portions of Driveways 
located within any public or private rights-of-way 
up to a maximum of twenty-five (25) ft. In areas 
with unusually large ROW widths or where 
Driveways must cross extensive State or other 
governmental lands (such as Fort Morgan 
Road) for property access, Driveways shall be 
paved for their entire length within the ROW or 
state or governmental land. 

7. Alternative Paving Standards. The reviewing authority 
may approve, following a recommendation by the City 
Engineer and Zoning Official, permeable paving 
surfaces in areas susceptible to flooding, and/or in 
zoning districts with restrictive impervious coverage 
standards. Pervious parking areas shall allow 
stormwater to percolate into the ground as designed 
as part of an overall stormwater management system 
in accordance with an approved site plan and the City 
of Gulf Shores Erosion Control, Sedimentation, 
Stormwater Runoff and Applicable 
Retention/Detention Ordinance. Permeable paving 
standards are as follows.  



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  
 
 

14-8 

a. All parking drive aisles, including ingress/egress 
aprons, shall be paved in accordance with the 
provisions of the Paragraph 6 Paving Standards 
above.  

b. Sub-surface soil testing shall demonstrate the 
manufacturer’s specifications will be met to 
allow for percolation and other stormwater 
functions.  

c. Permeable paving shall have at a minimum the 
following components; a durable load bearing 
pervious surface, a base course for stormwater 
storage and recharge, and a filter fabric. 
Permeable parking materials and installation 
procedures shall be in compliance with the 
manufacturers and/or industry standards.  

d. Gravel permeable paving shall be encapsulated 
by a minimum six (6) inch ribbon curb.  

e. Any stormwater piping associated with the 
permeable parking area, including pipe 
materials, sizes, slopes, and invert elevations at 
every bend or connection.  

f. Inspections. A state of Alabama registered 
professional engineer is required to design, 
make initial construction and annual inspections 
and tests as necessary to certify that 
construction of the permeable paving is 
consistent with the approved plans as well as 
the manufacturer’s standards. If maintenance is 
required the owner shall submit the following 
documentation: 

(1) Removal of visible surface sediment 
accumulations, and  

(2) Test results verifying the infiltration rate 
through the permeable pavement and base 
course materials system is in accordance 
with the approved permeable paving design 
and specifications.  

g. Repaving of pervious parking areas is prohibited 
unless approved by the reviewing authority. 

8. Paving and Landscape Exemptions for Industrial 
Areas. Parking areas within the IND District may have 
the paving and Landscaping requirements contained 
in this Ordinance reduced subject to approval of a 
Conditional Use Permit by the City Council. 
Modifications may include permitted use of substitute 
paving materials or reduced Interior or Perimeter 
Landscaping. Street Frontage Landscaping may only 
be reduced by the BZA when properties facing from 
across the Thoroughfare are also zoned as IND. 

9. Drainage. Off-street Parking facilities shall be drained 
to prevent damage to Abutting property and streets 

and to prevent pollutants from draining onto the 
beach. Landscaped areas and perimeter areas shall 
be so graded as to receive a reasonable portion of the 
rainfall from the surrounding pavement. Protective 
curbing around landscaped areas, if provided, shall 
leave openings for the flow of water onto unpaved 
areas. 

§14-2. Parking and Loading in Specified Overlay Districts.  

A. General Provisions for Overlay Districts. Off-street 
Parking in the Lagoon Pass, Beach Area, and Walking 
Area Overlay Districts shall be as otherwise required in 
this Article, except as provided in §14-2B. 

1. Limitation on surface parking. No surface Off-street 
Parking shall be located forward of the front Building 
Façade. 

2. Lighting. All parking decks and any surface parking 
lots with more than ten (10) spaces shall be 
Illuminated in accord with §6-13 Outdoor Lighting 
Standards (and Turtle Lighting Ordinance 1461, as 
referenced therein).  

B. Parking Reductions in Overlay Districts. Off-street 
Parking and Loading in the Lagoon Pass,  Beach Area, 
and Walking Area Overlay Districts shall be as 
otherwise required in this Article 14, except as provided 
herein. 

1. Subject to approval by the Commission, minimum 
parking requirements for a Mixed-use Development 
may be reduced by calculation of Shared Parking 
Requirements for the development utilizing the 
Shared Parking demand information in Table 14-2B 
(or as otherwise provided in §14-2B3). These parking 
reductions shall not be available to Lodging Uses and 
Multiple-family residential uses unless such uses are 
part of a development also including non-Lodging, 
Non-residential uses.  

2. Parking reductions may be allowed as part of Site 
Plan approval only if it is demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Commission that a combination of 
the following factors or measures are proposed by the 
development plan, including but not limited to: 

a. There are no material adverse impacts on 
parking conditions in the immediate vicinity. 

b. The development plan mitigates vehicular traffic 
impacts by proposing limited access to and from 
public Thoroughfares. 

c. The development plan proposes the creation of 
new or upgraded sidewalks or bikeways to help 
foster non-vehicular movement within, around 
and to the site. 

d. Public/private Open Spaces are provided with 
pedestrian and bikeway amenities (i.e., bicycle 



 

 

 14-9 Article 14: Parking Regulations 

racks, benches, open and landscaped areas, 
pedestrian landings, lighting, etc.). 

e. Additional landscape measures are taken 
beyond minimum City requirements to foster a 
high-quality beach attraction for tourists and 
further encourage pedestrian and bicycle 
access to the use or Premises. 

f. Safety signs, traffic signals, and crosswalks are 
implemented to help reduce any potential 
conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles. 

The Commission may also require a covenant be 
executed guaranteeing that the owner will provide 
additional spaces directly or by purchase of 
parking credits, if the City, upon investigation of 
the actual use of parking within two years of initial 
occupancy, finds there is insufficient parking, 
which must be proven by showing occupancy 

rates over 98 percent for a least two consecutive 
hours on at least three separate days within a 
single month.  

3. Local Parking Demand Study. At their option, the 
developer may prepare a local parking demand study 
to generate parking demand figures more suited to 
the proposal, its combination of uses, and location 
than that provided in Table 14-2B. The study shall be 
prepared by a qualified parking or traffic consultant, 
licensed architect, city or urban planner or civil 
engineer. The study shall prove to the satisfaction of 
the Zoning Official the alternative parking demand 
figures it generates. The Commission may require the 
owner/developer to pay a fee to be applied towards 
the cost of a parking study of actual parking 
accumulation to be carried out within one to two years 
of occupancy.

allowed to back on to Ft. Morgan Road (State Hwy. 
180), Beach Blvd. (State Hwy. 182), Gulf Shores 
Pkwy., (State Hwy. 59), and all other state and county 
roads. Excessive and unusual backing and turning 
movements shall be prohibited. All access ways and 
Loading areas shall provide a minimum horizontal and 
vertical clearance of fourteen (14) ft at all points. 

B. Dumpster/Garbage - Trash Disposal. 

1. For any commercial, industrial or Multiple-family 
development there shall be provided and maintained 
proper trash/garbage disposal. Dumpsters shall be 

provided unless the applicant can demonstrate that 
roll out trash containers are adequate for waste

approval of the location is granted by the City. 
Dumpsters shall be placed on a concrete pad of 
sufficient size and strength to support service vehicles 
without failure. All dumpsters located on site shall be 
Screened in accord with §12-2 Screening. An 
appropriate gate shall be provided. 

2. The owner, tenant, and/or agent, if any, shall be jointly 
and severally responsible for proper maintenance of 
required Screening, keeping lids closed at all times, 
and sanitizing dumpsters after each pickup. 

3. A permit approved by the Building Inspector shall be 
required for the location of any dumpster located 
subsequent to Site Plan approval.  

§14-4. Bicycle Parking.  

Bicycle Parking shall be provided for all new 
developments with fifteen (15) or greater required 
vehicle parking spaces.  A rate of one (1) bicycle 
parking space shall be provided per every twenty five

Building and accessible from off-site bicycle paths, 
on-street Bicycle Lanes, or sidewalks, as appropriate. 

 
  
 



 

 

 15-1 Article 15: Planned Unit Development 

 

ARTICLE 15: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT  

§15-1. Purpose.  

The purpose of Planned Unit Development, 
hereinafter referred to as “PUD”, regulations is to 
encourage flexibility in the design and development of 
land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to 
implement the goals of the Land Use Plan; to 
encourage Mixed-use developments; to facilitate the 
adequate and economical provision of streets, utilities 
and public spaces; and to preserve the natural and 
scenic qualities of open areas. The procedure is 
intended to permit diversification in the location of 
Structures and improve circulation facilities and other 
site qualities while ensuring adequate standards 
relating to public health, safety, comfort, order, 
appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare 
both in the use and occupancy of Buildings and 
facilities in planned groups. 

§15-2.  Applicability.  

Minimum site size for PUDs shall be as provided in 
Table 15-1. 

Table 15-1: Minimum Size of Planned Unit Developments

Overlay District 

10 ac 

 
A. Applicability within Overlay Districts. Subject to the 

approval of the Council after a review and report by the 
Commission and after a public hearing, PUDs are a 
permitted use in any district except any district located 
partially or entirely within the Beach Area Overlay, 
Walking Area Overlay or Lagoon Pass Overlay District. 

B. Applicability within the BT-1N District. PUDs may 
encompass multiple tracts of land provided all Parcels 
are contiguous for at least fifty (50) ft, or the only 
separation is a body of water that measures less than 
200 ft between the closest property corners of the 
separated tracts. However, all the Parcels joined in a 
PUD application shall be under the same ownership at 
the time of application or said approval shall be 
conditioned upon the presentation to and acceptance by 
the City of a legal instrument demonstrating unified 
control of all properties included in the PUD. 

§15-3. Method.  

For Planned Unit Developments, the existing zoning 
classification shall be retained or may be changed to 
another zoning classification concurrently with 
approval of a PUD Master Plan. The PUD, then, 
serves as an overlay to the base zoning classification, 
in which modifications to the use, intensity and design 
regulations of the base zoning district may be 
considered as a part of the PUD Master Plan 
approval, to the extent permitted in this Article. PUD 
developments may extend across multiple zoning 
districts or, if the concerned property includes only 
one zoning designation, it may be divided into multiple 
zoning districts, which may be approved concurrently 
with the PUD Master Plan. In any case, the uses and 
zoning designations requested shall only be approved 
if found to be consistent with the City’s 
Comprehensive Plan and Land Use Plan component. 

Development standards, including but not limited to 
yards and setbacks, building design criteria, parking 
and loading requirements, trip generation factors, 
landscaping and buffer requirements, and 
thoroughfare standards, may be modified by one of 
the following methods, subject to the limitations of and 
upon review of the criteria outlined in §15-4 Use, 
Intensity and Design: 

A. with approval of a PUD Master Plan or amendment 
thereto; 

B. with approval of preliminary subdivision/Site Plans by 
the Commission. 

C. by phase in accordance with §15-6 Review and 
Approval Procedures and/or Article 5 of the Subdivision 
Regulations. 

§15-4. Use, Intensity, and Design.  

The following criteria will be considered in reviewing a 
PUD plan: 

A. Uses. The uses permitted in a PUD shall be those uses 
permitted in the base zoning district(s), except to the 
extent modified by the PUD subject to conformity with 
the City’s Land Use Plan. Uses that normally require 
approval as Conditional Uses, within the base zoning 
district(s), may be approved concurrently with the PUD 
Master Plan. When not approved at the time of Master 
Plan approval, such uses shall be subject to the normal 
procedures for Conditional Uses or an amendment to 
the PUD. Mixing of uses in PUDs is encouraged and 
therefore PUDs, which incorporate multiple uses and 
zoning districts are appropriate. The following are 
guidelines against which PUD applications shall be 
reviewed, as appropriate to the uses permitted and the 
size of the PUD: 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

15-2 

1. PUDs should include, at a minimum, housing, 
recreational amenities, community facilities and Open 
Spaces. Large PUDs should incorporate workplaces, 
shops and Restaurants that are accessible internally 
and externally. Availability of jobs, shops, dining and 
recreational activities within walking distance can 
reduce traffic within the development, support 
community interaction and add to the development’s 
vitality. 

2. Activity centers are the primary locations for 
integrating Non-residential and Mixed-use 
development into PUDs. In addition, activity centers 
may include Multiple-family developments, which can 
be incorporated into Mixed-use Buildings, and be 
surrounded by higher Density Single-family housing. 
Where justified by the number of homes to be 
included, the development may be asked to donate or 
reserve land for a school, fire station, or other 
community facilities. 

3. For large PUDs with a mix of uses, uses placed at the 
periphery of the development should be compatible 
with, if not the same as, existing or planned uses in 
Adjacent areas of the community. 

4. Uses should be laid out within a PUD so that “like 
faces like” across Thoroughfares. For example, 
Mixed-use or non-residential development on one 
side of a street should face similar uses on the other 
side of the street; residential uses should face 
residential uses of similar density; etc. Exceptions 
may be appropriate when the associated 
Thoroughfare is of higher classification (i.e. Arterial or 
Collector).  

B. Intensity and Density. Intensity and Density of uses 
permitted within a PUD are based on the area and 
dimensional regulations of the base zoning 
classification. Where the base zoning classification 
permitted specified Density increases or Building 
Heights, such increases shall generally be available 
within that portion of the PUD. However, such increases 
may be limited in certain base zoning classifications, as 
follows: 

1. Approval of a PUD development within the BG, BT-
1N, ICW-N, or ICW-S districts shall result in no net 
increase in the Building Height, Gross Floor Area 
(GFA), or residential Density otherwise permitted by 
the regulations of the applicable zoning district that 
are in effect at the time of such approval. 

2. For all other districts, no increase in density shall be 
considered in a request for a PUD unless specifically 
authorized by the base zoning district. 

3. Refer to §15-5 for special provisions for PUDS in the 
Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay District. 

C. Center-Oriented.  

1. PUDs larger than twenty-five (25) acres should be 
designed as one or more neighborhoods arranged 
around an activity center(s) such as a “village center” 
or “neighborhood center” that is designed as a 
functional and visual focus point within the 
development. These centers will generally include 
higher-Density residential uses, a park/commons, and 
a community facility (recreational facilities, churches, 
libraries, schools, Day Care Centers, etc.) at a 
minimum and may include other uses. 

2. For smaller developments, orientation around an 
existing, Adjacent activity center may be acceptable. 
This is achieved when the majority of the PUD site is 
located within one-quarter (1/4) mile of an activity 
center designated in the Gulf Shores Land Use Plan, 
as amended. 

D. Integrating PUDs into the Community. PUDs should not 
be designed as enclaves isolated from surrounding 
neighborhoods and activity centers, but should be 
designed integrally to the larger community. 

1. PUDs should not be gated. 

2. Development along the perimeter of the PUD site 
should front on existing Abutting roads. Only when the 
external road is a high speed Arterial or when another 
functional reason exists that discourages frontage 
development, should Lots be allowed to “back up” to 
an Abutting Thoroughfare. Single-family and Duplex 
dwellings are not permitted to front on Arterial 
Thoroughfares. 

E. Housing Diversity. 

1. PUDs should include a range of housing choices to 
serve the needs and desires of different market 
segments, for example, affordable housing and senior 
housing. 

2. Where appropriate given the applicable zoning and 
land use planning for the location, a variety of housing 
types should be provided in addition to conventional 
Single-family detached homes. Other residential types 
that should be considered are: Accessory Dwellings 
on Single-family Lots, Cottage Subdivisions (small 
Lots which front on a common green), Townhouses, 
live-work Buildings, lofts, and “urban” Multiple-family 
Buildings (within or Adjacent to Mixed-use or Non-
residential areas). 

3. The arrangement and design of the residential 
portions of a PUD shall be considered with regard to 
providing an appropriate balance between visual 
interaction with the street and privacy for residents. 
For example, front porches establish visual interaction 
while also maintaining a physical transition between 



 

 

 15-3 Article 15: Planned Unit Development 

the more public nature of the street and sidewalk and 
the more private nature of the dwelling.  

F. Improvement Standards. A PUD shall conform with the 
Subdivision Regulations and this Ordinance, except 
where variations are approved by the Council, and with 
all other applicable ordinances in respect to the design, 
construction and guarantee of completion and 
maintenance of all required physical Improvements 
including but not limited to Thoroughfares, drainage, 
water supply and sewage collection. The following 
design criteria shall be considered by the Council with 
regard to any modification or waiver to the general 
requirements of this Ordinance and the Subdivision 
Regulations. 

1. Accommodations for Walking and Bicycling. 

a. The following components should be included to 
provide “walkability”: small Block sizes; 
sidewalks and trails; Complete Street 
environments; and a variety of destinations 
(neighborhoods, business areas, parks and 
Open Spaces) within a five-minute walking 
distance (or ¼ mile radius) of every home. 

b. At a minimum, an activity center or 
neighborhood park should be within one-quarter 
(¼) mile of every home (as measured along 
connecting sidewalks, not in a straight line), 
although homes in low-Density residential areas 
may be excluded. 

c. Bike lanes should be considered for inclusion on 
Arterials and Collectors. To this extent, driveway 
access and on-street parking along higher 
classification Thoroughfares may be restricted, if 
in conflict, with provision of suitable walking and 
bicycling facilities. 

2. Connectivity. The street network should be designed 
with many internal and external connections to 
provide route options for motorists and to ensure best 
access for emergency services. 

a. Internal Connectivity. The internal street network 
should be designed to disperse internal traffic 
evenly throughout the neighborhood(s) rather 
than funneling most traffic onto only a few major 
Thoroughfares within the development. 

(1) Cul-de-sacs should be avoided wherever 
possible. Where it is necessary to terminate 
the internal street network, circles and closes 
(loops) should be used rather than cul-de-
sacs. 

 

Close or Loop Street 

(2) If a Cul-de-sac is used, its diameter should 
be increased to accommodate a landscaped 
open space at its center, no less than 20 ft in 
any dimension, and a pedestrian and/or 
bicycle path should be provided at the head 
of the cul-de-sac which provides access to 
Adjacent Blocks, neighborhoods, open 
spaces, or pedestrian/bicycle ways. These 
connections should be in an easement of at 
least ten (10) ft in width. 

b. External Connectivity. The internal street 
network should include multiple access points to 
the surrounding street network to avoid or 
minimize traffic congestion at entrances/exits to 
the development. This is also advantageous for 
emergency access. 

(1) Where Adjacent to vacant, developable land, 
stub streets should be provided for future 
external connections. 

(2) Where Adjacent to existing stub streets, the 
PUD shall incorporate and connect the 
existing stub street into the planned street 
network. 

(3) Where located Adjacent to an existing or 
proposed transit line, the development should 
incorporate access to the existing or 
proposed service, including a new stop 
where applicable. 

(4) Trails, greenways and similar paths shown 
on the City Land Use Plan and/or Master 
Sidewalk and Bikeway Plan shall be 
incorporated into a PUD Master Plan where it 
passes through the PUD, or if adjacent to the 
PUD, connections to such paths should be 
provided. 

3. Complete Streets. Internal streets should be designed 
to be safe and attractive and to accommodate 
automobiles, pedestrians and bicyclists, and the 
handicapped in accord with the street design 
standards in the Subdivision Regulations and as 
described below: 

 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

15-4 

a. Lot Frontage and Access.  

(1) Lots should front on and may have access 
along most Thoroughfares within a PUD. 
However, where higher classification 
thoroughfares (Collectors or Arterials) are 
called for, either by the PUD or by the City’s 
Master Street Plan, specific planning and 
design treatments may be necessary to 
provide the desired function of the proposed 
Thoroughfare (i.e. capacity) while balancing 
said vehicular function with appropriate 
design speeds and accommodation of 
walking and bicycling facilities. Though 
properties are generally permitted to front on 
Collectors, vehicular access may be required 
by Local Streets or Alleys. 

(2) Double-frontage lots and single-tiered blocks 
should be avoided, although such conditions 
may be acceptable along higher classification 
Thoroughfares, but only on a case-by-case 
basis.  

b. Narrow lanes. Vehicular lanes should be narrow 
to calm traffic while including adequate width for 
access by emergency vehicles. Vehicular lanes 
should be eleven (11) ft in width for most local 
streets and other Thoroughfares where a speed 
limit of twenty-five (25) miles per hour is 
intended. 

c. On-street Parking. 

(1) Local streets serving activity centers and 
high-Density residential areas should include 
On-street Parking on both sides. 

(2) On-street Parking on one side of the road 
should be included in medium-Density 
residential areas, at a minimum. 

(3) Local streets serving low-Density residential 
areas should only include On-street Parking 
on one side at a maximum. 

(4) Higher speed roads with little or no fronting 
development are not appropriate for On-
street Parking. 

d. Planting Strips. Planting Strips should be 
provided along the edges of the roadway for 
Landscaping purposes and should be five (5) ft 
in width at a minimum. In activity centers, these 
Planting Strips will be Hardscaped and act as an 
extension of the sidewalk, while including 
regularly spaced tree wells and other landscape 
areas. In residential areas, Planting Strips will 
be grassed and include regularly spaced Street 
Trees. In low Density residential areas, Planting 

Strips are replaced by vegetated swales or by 
lawn area. 

e. Street Trees. Street Trees are placed within the 
Planting Strip at the edge of the roadway to 
provide shade and enclosure to ensure a 
properly scaled environment. In higher Density 
areas, Street Trees should be uniformly placed 
within the street environment; while in lower 
Density areas, tree types and placement may be 
more varied to accentuate the more natural 
characteristics of such neighborhoods. 

f. Sidewalks. 

(1) Residential sidewalks should be wide enough 
(five (5) ft at a minimum) to allow two 
pedestrians to pass one another or for two 
pedestrians to walk side-by-side comfortably. 
Sidewalks should be provided on both sides 
of the street in medium and high density 
residential areas. Low Density residential 
areas may not require sidewalks but should 
be connected, at a minimum, to activity 
centers by trails or paths.  

(2) In activity centers, sidewalks should be eight 
(8) ft wide at a minimum plus the Planting 
Strip. Sidewalks should be located on both 
sides of the street. 

(3) All development areas, including recreational 
open space, within a PUD should be 
connected to activity centers (whether 
internal or not) either by sidewalks or by off-
road trails, greenways or other paths.  

g. Bicycle Facilities. Collectors and Arterials within 
or along the perimeter of a PUD should 
accommodate on-street Bike Lanes or off-road 
Multi-Purpose Trails. On-street facilities are 
more appropriate in non-residential, mixed-use 
and dense residential areas, while off-road 
facilities are more appropriate in low density 
residential areas. Designated bike lanes are 
generally not necessary on Local Streets. 

h. Curbs and Drainage. In activity centers and 
medium and high-Density residential areas, curb 
and gutter is required to capture runoff and to 
direct drainage into storm sewers. In lower 
Density residential neighborhoods, valley curbs 
or vegetated swales are sufficient. In no case 
shall a valley curb be placed within five (5) ft of 
a sidewalk. 

i. Lighting and Utilities. Street lighting should be 
attractively designed and should provide lighting 
for vehicular traffic and lower-scaled lighting for 
pedestrians. There shall be no overhead utility 



 

 

 15-5 Article 15: Planned Unit Development 

lines along any Street Frontage. All utilities shall 
be placed underground. 

j. Frontage conditions. Streets should be visually 
enclosed by the Buildings alongside them. 
However, where Buildings can not be used to 
enclose a street, such as in the instance of open 
spaces and parking lots, low walls, trees and 
Shrubs should be included to define the edge of 
the public street environment from the private 
space or open space bordering it.  

(1) Parking lots may be permitted to abut rights-
of-way only in activity centers and only when 
designed as described herein. 

(2) Off-street Parking in residential areas shall 
not be permitted forward of the Building Line 
with the exception of Driveways which shall 
not be wider than twelve (12) ft at the ROW 
Line and for a depth of at least twenty (20) ft. 
Driveways wider than twelve (12) ft should be 
located to the side or rear of the Dwelling and 
never forward of the Front Building Line. 

(3) Enclosed garages of detached Single-family 
Dwellings should be set back at least five (5) 
ft behind the Front Building Line. Enclosed 
garages of attached Single-family Dwellings 
should only be located at the rear of the 
Dwelling, accessed from an Alley or similar 
joint access. 

G. Screening and Buffers. Screening for individual uses 
and Structures shall be consistent with the requirements 
of §12-2 Screening. Buffering of uses along the 
perimeter of a PUD shall be consistent with §12-3 
Buffers. Buffers between uses within the interior of a 
PUD may be waived or modified by the approving 
authority during Master Plan approval. 

§15-5. Special Provisions for PUDs in the Fort Morgan 
Peninsula Overlay District.  

In addition to the other requirements of this Article, the 
following criteria shall further guide the consideration 
of PUDs within the Fort Morgan Peninsula Overlay 
District. 

A. Multiple-family, Mixed-use PUDs. 

1. A Mixed-use, Multiple-family, or commercial PUD 
must have a minimum of ten (10) or more contiguous 
acres that are not separated by Fort Morgan Road. 

2. PUDs within the BT Districts may increase their 
Density by a maximum otherwise allowed by the base 
zoning district; and may increase their maximum 
height by up to five (5) Habitable Stories above the 
maximum otherwise allowed by the base district. 

3. PUDs within the BN District will not receive increases 
in Density. 

4. Subject to the discretion of the Council, all or a portion 
of the Commercial Uses may be required to be 
located Adjacent to Ft. Morgan Road. 

5. Most, if not all, required parking is to be located under 
the Building. 

6. The maximum Impervious Surface area should be 
thirty-five (35) percent. 

7. No Density transfers shall be permitted across Fort 
Morgan Road. This includes transfers toward the 
waterfront or away from the waterfront. 

B. Single-family PUDs. 

1. A Single Family PUD must have a minimum of two (2) 
or more contiguous acres that are not separated by 
any ROW. 

2. Must be zoned R-1 or R-2. 

3. Condominium PUDs may request common Driveways 
for access and non-traditional paving surfaces so long 
as an all-weather surface is provided. Post-storm 
clean-up issues and impacts on endangered species 
will be considered in reviewing alternative paving 
requests. 

4. PUDs will not increase Density but should attempt to 
create larger and more significant Open Spaces 
through the Conservation Subdivision approach (§11-
10). 

5. PUDs should provide exceptional amenities and 
common areas Adjacent to water bodies and other 
natural areas. 

C. Permitted Uses. The uses permitted shall be those uses 
permitted by the base zoning district, except as modified 
through Master Plan approval, and as limited by §15-5D 
Prohibited Uses. 

D. Prohibited Uses. Outdoor Storage, heavy commercial, 
industry, adult entertainment, motion picture theaters, 
Building materials, pawn shops, auto body shops, auto 
sales, parts and services, car washes, and Junkyards. 

§15-6. Review and Approval Procedures. 

A. Submission Requirements; PUD Master Plan. To 
provide an expedited method for processing a PUD 
Master Plan all procedures for approval or disapproval 
of a Master Plan, and the continuing administration 
thereof, shall be subject to following provisions: 

1. An application for a Master Plan shall be filed by or on 
behalf of the landowner with the Zoning Official. The 
purpose of the Master Plan is to provide the City with 
information in respect to the type, character, scale 
and intensity of development as well as the time 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

15-6 

phasing of the proposed PUD for the City to evaluate 
the impact of the development upon the City. 

2. The application for Master Plan approval shall include 
a written statement describing fully the character and 
intended use of the PUD and setting forth the reasons 
why the PUD would be in the public interest and 
would be consistent with the City's statement of 
purposes on PUD. 

3. The applicant shall provide a written narrative 
specifically calling out all zoning relaxations being 
requested through the PUD. These may include 
clustering of units, reduced Lot size and Setbacks, 
use considerations, Building Height Variances, design 
considerations, etc., and shall also identify the private 
and public benefits of the PUD, including but not 
limited to: 

a. Public Benefits: Traffic and utility Improvements, 
regional and local bicycle/pedestrian 
Improvements, Buffering from Adjacent sites, 
aesthetic Improvements, dedication of school or 
park sites, enhancement of property values, 
sign enhancements, preservation of natural 
areas and views, creating public access to water 
or other popular sites. 

b. Private Benefits: Amenities for site users, Open 
Space and recreation, clustering of uses, 
creation of neighborhoods, Landscaping, traffic 
circulation, multi-modal circulation (including 
bicycle and pedestrian elements), private space 
for units, parking, tree preservation, preserving 
unique views and natural areas in common 
areas for the use and enjoyment of all 
residents/guests (such as water fronts), 
enhanced architecture and site layout. 

4. The PUD Master Plan shall consist of a site plan, 
preliminary landscape plan, building elevations, 
design guidelines, residential lot layout, open space 
plan, bicycle/pedestrian circulation plan, and other 
plans applicable to the project. The use and 
development of the property in a PUD shall 
substantially conform to the development plan 
approved by the Council as an exhibit to the 
Ordinance for approval of the PUD.  

5. Applications shall be accompanied by additional 
narratives, drawings, and other information as 
required by the CDD. 

B. Review Procedure. An application for a Master Plan 
shall be filed with the Zoning Official. Upon receipt of 
said application, the Zoning Official shall review said 
application to determine its appropriateness and 
completeness and accept or reject the application. Upon 
acceptance of a completed application, a PUD proposal 

shall be reviewed and approved as required for rezoning 
requests in Article 3, unless modified herein. 

During the review process, the City may retain 
consultants to assist in the review. The cost of 
retaining said consultants shall be borne by the 
applicant.  

C. The Findings. 

1. The Council shall, by ordinance, either (1) grant 
approval of the Master Plan as submitted, (2) grant 
approval subject to specified conditions not included 
in the Master Plan as submitted, or (3) deny approval 
to the plan. 

a. In the event approval is granted, the Council 
shall, as part of its ordinance, specify the 
drawings, specifications and form of 
performance and maintenance bonds that shall 
accompany an application for final approval. 

b. In the event approval is granted subject to 
conditions, the applicant shall within forty-five 
(45) days after receiving a copy of the written 
resolution of the Council notify the Council in 
writing of his acceptance or refusal of all said 
conditions. 

c. In the event that applicant refuses to accept all 
said conditions or fails to reply within forty-five 
(45) days, the Council shall be deemed to have 
denied approval of the plan. 

2. The grant or denial of approval by Ordinance shall 
include not only conclusions but also findings of fact 
related to the specific proposal, including a finding 
that the public and private benefits generated from the 
PUD, as proposed, equal or exceed the benefit 
granted to the applicant through any modifications or 
waivers of this Ordinance, and shall set forth the 
reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for 
denials, and said Ordinance shall specify in what 
respects the plan would not be in the public interest, 
including but limited to findings of fact and 
conclusions of the following: 

a. In what respect the plan is or is not consistent 
with the statement of purpose for PUDs;  

b. The extents to which the PUD is consistent with 
and achieves goals of the Comprehensive Plan. 

c. The extent to which the plan departs from 
zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise 
applicable to the subject property. 

d. The purpose, location and amount of the 
Common Open Space in the PUD, the reliability 
of the proposals for maintenance and 
conservation of the Common Open Space, and 
the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and 



 

 

 15-7 Article 15: Planned Unit Development 

purpose of the Common Open Space is related 
to the proposed Density and type of 
development. 

e. The physical design of the plan and the manner 
in which said design does or does not make 
adequate provision for public services, provide 
adequate control over vehicular traffic and 
parking and further the amenities of light and air, 
recreation and visual enjoyment. 

f. The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the 
proposed PUD to the neighborhood in which it is 
proposed to be established. 

g. In the case of a plan which proposes 
development over a period of years, the 
sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended 
to protect the interest of the public and of the 
residents and owners of the PUD in the integrity 
of the plan. 

3. In granting approval, the Council may apply any 
conditions deemed necessary to protect Adjacent 
property, the public interest or to ensure that the 
public/private benefits generated by the application 
are adequately balanced against the benefits granted 
to the applicant. To this end, the Council may attach 
conditions to an approval including, but not limited to, 
the following:  

a. On-site improvements and off-site 
improvements within public ROWs or off-road 
trails, greenways or paths; 

b. Development standards;  

c. Design guidelines; 

d. Conditions on uses;  

e. Dedication of land for public purposes or 
reservation of land for future public acquisition;  

f. Granting of utility easements; 

g. Granting of easements for public trails and open 
spaces; and 

h. Requirements for establishment of a 
homeowners’ or property owners’ associations 
or other mechanism to assure continued 
maintenance of commonly owned land and 
facilities. 

D. Status of Plan after Master Plan Approval. Within seven 
(7) days after the adoption of the ordinance provided for 
in §15-6C, a copy of the ordinance shall be mailed to the 
applicant. Where approval of a Master Plan has been 
granted, the same shall be noted on the Official Zoning 
Map. A Master Plan, upon approval, as provided herein, 
is defined as running with the land subject to the 
limitations specified in Paragraphs G and H following; 

provided, however, that an applicant may apply for an 
amendment to said Master Plan in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in §15-6H. Approval of a Master 
Plan shall not authorize a plat of the PUD for recording 
purposes or Site Plan approval, or authorize 
development or the issuance of any Building Permits. A 
Master Plan, which has been given approval as 
submitted or with conditions (and provided that the 
applicant has not defaulted nor violated any such 
conditions ), shall not be modified, revoked or otherwise 
impaired by action of the City pending an application for 
plat approval, without the consent of the applicant, 
provided an application for plat or Site Plan approval 
(whichever is applicable) is filed or, in the case of 
development over a period of years, provided 
applications are filed within the periods of time specified 
in the ordinance granting approval of the Master Plan. 

Approval of a Master Plan with or without special 
conditions shall represent the zoning of that area 
contained within the plan and shall apply to the land 
in a manner consistent with zoning unaffected by 
the sale or transfer of ownership of the land. Upon 
approval, the applicant shall be released to apply for 
plat or Site Plan approval (whichever is applicable) 
in accord with the Subdivision Regulations and/or 
§3-3 Site Plan Review of this Ordinance. The 
processing of a Site Plan or subdivision plat 
commensurate with the PUD Master Plan is 
acceptable so long as the PUD is adopted prior to 
the other approvals or the subdivision/Site Plan 
approvals are conditioned on the PUD being 
approved by the Council. In the case of a 
subdivision plat it shall not be signed by the City or 
recorded unless and until said PUD is approved. If 
said PUD is not approved within sixty (60) days of 
the subdivision or Site Plan approval they shall 
become null and void.  

E. Multiple Phase PUDS. The Master Plan shall include a 
Phasing Schedule for any PUD to be developed in 
multiple phases, which describes when major 
Thoroughfares, open and recreational spaces, and 
similar amenities or community facilities will be 
dedicated, reserved or constructed. The Phasing 
Schedule shall include the timing of providing all 
Improvements as proffered. The Phasing Schedule shall 
also consider the need for future amendments, where 
necessary or desirable. The Zoning Official may 
approve minor revisions to the Phasing Schedule where 
it can be shown to be in the best interest of the PUD and 
the City. 

F. Abandonment After Approval.  

In the event that a plan or a section thereof is 
approved by the Council, and thereafter the 
applicant abandons said plan or the section thereof 
and so notifies the Council in writing, or, in the event 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

15-8 

the applicant fails to commence construction of the 
PUD, excluding site grading, within five (5) years of 
Master Plan approval, such approval shall terminate 
and be deemed null and void, in which case the 
property shall revert to the base zoning 
classification. The Council shall have the authority to 
extend this period for no more than one (1) year and 
may only grant such an extension one (1) time for 
an approved Master Plan. 

G. Inactive PUDs.  

1. Any approved PUD, or any phase of an approved 
PUD shall be classified inactive if: 

a. Five (5) years following the date of approval by 
the Council, there is no valid Building Permit in 
effect and substantial construction other than 
site grading has not begun 

b. Less than sixty (60) percent of the floor area has 
been constructed, and five (5) years have 
expired since the most recent newly constructed 
Building received a Certificate of Occupancy; 
there is no valid Building Permit in effect, and 
substantial construction to resume construction 
activity other than site grading has not begun 

2. Exception for PUDs with phasing schedules 
exceeding five (5) years: If the developer provides 
evidence, and the Zoning Official makes findings, that 
a multi-phase PUD has adhered to the approved 
development schedule, and that construction of 
Buildings and uses has been uninterrupted, then the 
failure to meet the construction targets of Items 1a 
and 1b above on one or more individual phases shall 
not cause said phases to be classified inactive. For 
purposes of this Subsection, construction is 
uninterrupted when there is no interval of twelve (12) 
or more months when a Certificate of Occupancy has 
not been issued for a newly constructed Building 
somewhere in the PUD, without regard to phase lines. 

3. No Land Disturbing Activity Permit nor Building Permit 
for new Building construction shall be issued for an 
inactive PUD, or for any inactive phase(s) thereof, 
until the PUD is reviewed by the Commission and the 
Council takes final action as outlined below. 

4. Review of an inactive PUD, or any inactive phase(s) 
thereof, may be performed by the Commission, on its 
own initiative; upon referral by City Staff; or upon 
request of the property owner(s) or agent. In such 
case, the Commission, and any subsequent action by 
the Council, shall follow the same procedures for 
meetings and public notice as provided in §3-6 Zoning 
Amendments except as modified below. 

5. Within ninety (90) days, the Commission shall provide 
recommendations to the Council which reflects its 
findings on the following: 

a. Whether the PUD or phase(s) thereof under 
review has become inactive, according to this 
Subsection 

b. The appropriateness of the continued 
implementation of the PUD or phase(s) thereof 
as adopted, based on current conditions and 
circumstances, including the appropriate base 
zoning district necessary to implement the PUD 
as it exists 

c. Any recommendation to amend the PUD Master 
Plan or individual phase(s) thereof to properly 
reflect existing conditions and circumstances, 
and the appropriate base zoning classification(s) 
should the zoning provisions of the Master Plan 
be removed, in whole or in part, from the area of 
the inactive PUD or the area of any inactive 
phase(s). 

6. The Council shall take final action to re-authorize the 
existing PUD Master Plan, amend the PUD Master 
Plan (if requested or agreed to by the owner(s) or 
agent), or deem the PUD Master Plan null and void, in 
which case the property shall revert to the base 
zoning classification. 

H. Amendments. Amendments to the approved Master 
Plan may be made if shown to be in the best interests of 
the PUD and the City as follows: 

1. The Zoning Official may approve minor revisions to 
the Master Plan, including but not limited to: 

a. Adjustments to the boundaries of Open Space 
areas as designated on the Master Plan, 
provided that the approved overall percentage in 
an area is not altered and the utility of Open 
Space areas is not materially changed 

b. Roadway plan adjustments, which occur within 
areas of like uses and do not significantly alter 
the overall transportation system 

c. Minor phasing schedule changes, which shall 
not exceed a change of ten (10) percent of the 
approved non-residential GFA or approved 
number of dwelling units from one phase to 
another 

d. Density shifts between residential areas, which 
involve no more than a five (5) percent Density 
increase within the subject phase, provided that 
the approved Density for the entire Master Plan 
is not increased. 



 

 

 15-9 Article 15: Planned Unit Development 

2. Major amendments to the Master Plan may be made 
only through the rezoning process in §3-6 and include 
but are not limited to: 

a. An increase in area of any of the approved land 
uses shown on the approved Master Plan. 

b. A change that would increase the land use 
intensity or Density within any phase of the 
Master Plan without a corresponding decrease 
in some other phase. 

c. A shift of development Density that would 
adversely impact on-site or off-site 
transportation systems. 

d. Major phasing schedule changes, which exceed 
a change of ten (10) percent of the approved 
non-residential GFA or approved number of 
dwelling units from one phase to another 

e. Any adjustment not deemed a minor 
amendment by the Zoning Official 

3. Amendments to an approved Master Plan shall not 
modify the PUD Abandonment and Inactivity 
requirements of §15-6F and §15-6G above unless 
specifically requested and approved by the reviewing 
authority. 

I. Application for Plat or Site Plan Approval. An application 
for plat or Site Plan approval may be for all the land 
included in the plan, or to the extent set forth in the 
Master Plan approval, for a section thereof. The 
application shall include such drawings, specifications, 
covenants, easements, conditions and forms of 
performance and maintenance bonds as set forth by 
ordinance of the Council at the time of approval of the 
Master Plan and as required by the Subdivision 
Regulations or §3-3 Site Plan Review in this Ordinance, 
whichever is applicable.  

J. Requirements. Applications for plat or Site Plan 
approval of a PUD or portion thereof shall be 
accompanied by the materials required by the CDD for 
PUD Plat and Site Plan Approvals, any additional 
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations or §3-3 Site 
Plan Review, as applicable, and the following: 

1. Agreements, provisions, declarations or covenants 
which govern the use, maintenance and continued 
protection of the PUD and any of its common open 
areas and other amenities. 

2. The final plan shall be accompanied by a written 
agreement, in a form acceptable to the City's legal 
counsel, on behalf of the owner, or the owner's 
successors and assigns as follows: 

a. that the proposed development, as shown on 
the plans and as set forth in specifications, will 

be completed in every detail within such time 
period as may be agreed upon by the Council 

b. that all land Improvements intended for the 
common use of all residents, including drives, 
walks, parking areas, recreational facilities and 
equipment and all landscaped or other Common 
Open Space will be maintained in perpetuity, 
including such servicing as may be required for 
the use of such land Improvements 

c. that no future changes in the development shall 
be made which would encroach upon the land 
used to comply with the requirements of this 
article as to Density, Open Space, Yards, 
courts, vehicular access, automobile parking, 
Building Coverage or other outdoor 
requirements 

d. that all easements for private drives, utility lines 
and similar purposes shall be open at all times 
for access by publicly employed personnel and 
equipment for police and fire protection, for 
inspection of utility systems and for any other 
public purpose.  

K. Compliance with Master Plan Required for Plat 
Approval. If the Zoning Official finds that said application 
for plat or Site Plan approval is in substantial 
compliance with the Master Plan, the application shall 
proceed in accord with the procedures set forth in the 
Subdivision Regulations or §3-3 Site Plan Review, as 
applicable.  

A plan submitted for plat or Site Plan approval of a 
portion of an Master Plan shall be deemed to be in 
substantial compliance with the approved Master 
Plan provided any modification by the applicant 
does not change the Density, Open Space or other 
provisions of the total PUD and any portion thereof 
does not: 

1. vary the proposed residential Density or intensity of 
use by more than five ( 5) percent; 

2. involve a reduction of the area set aside for Common 
Open Space nor the substantial relocation of such 
area; 

3. increase by more than ten (10) percent the floor area 
proposed for Non-residential use; nor 

4. increase by more than five (5) percent the total 
ground areas covered by Buildings nor involve a 
substantial change in the height of Buildings. 

L. Status of Plan after Plat or Site Plan Approval. Where 
approval of a Plat or Site plan has been granted, said 
approvals shall remain active in accordance with the 
timelines established in the Subdivision Regulations or 
in §3-3 Site Plan Review of this Ordinance.

 16-1 Article 16: Site Plan Review   

ARTICLE 16: SITE PLAN REVIEW  

§16-1. Site Plan Review.  

Site Plan Review by the Commission or administrative 
Site Plan Review by the Community Development 
Department (CDD) shall be required in accordance 
with §3-3 Site Plan Review. The following standards 
shall be used in reviewing any Site Plan. At the time of 
alterations or enlargement of a nonconforming 
Structure(s) or site, the entire Structure(s) and site 
shall be made to conform with the requirements of this 
Article.  

A. Traffic Access Criteria.  

1. All proposed access ways are adequate, but not 
excessive in number; adequate in Grade, width, 
alignment and visibility; and not located too near 
street corners or adjacent driveways (in accord with 
City Access Standards), places of public assembly 
and other similar considerations. 

2. Driveways, unless they provide through access to an 
Abutting street, shall not be aligned to an intersection, 
whether signalized or not. 

B. Circulation and Parking Criteria.  

1. There shall be adequate, safe and convenient 
arrangement of Thoroughfares, Driveways, Off-street 
Parking, Loading space and pedestrian circulation 
facilities. To this end, pedestrian walkways shall be 
provided within all developments and shall be 
arranged in a manner that allows for safe and efficient 
pedestrian travel both in and around the site, 
separating pedestrian use areas from parking lots, 
Loading areas, Driveways, and roadways. 

2. Thoroughfares, pedestrian walks and Open Space 
shall be designed as integral parts of the overall site 
design. They shall be properly related to existing and 
proposed Buildings and appropriately landscaped.  

a. To properly accommodate pedestrian 
circulation, logical connections shall be provided 
between on-site and off-site walkways.  

b. In the event that off-site walkways are not 
provided but where the subject site is situated 
along an identified segment of the Master 
Bikeway and Sidewalk Plan for the City, it shall 
be the responsibility of the developer to provide 
for these off-site walkways and such provision 
shall become an integral part of the overall site 
development plan. 

3. Materials and design of paving, lighting fixtures, 
retaining walls, fences, curbs, benches, and signs 
shall be of good appearance, easily maintained and 
appropriate to their function. 

4. Parking facilities shall be designed with careful regard 
to orderly arrangement, landscaping, drainage, ease 
of access, adequacy and shall be developed as an 
integral part of an overall site design.  

a. In other than the BA and Industrial Districts, Off-
street Parking should be located to the rear or 
side of Buildings, rather than in front of them. 
However, it is understood that this may not be 
practicable in all cases, such as previously 
subdivided or developed lands 

b. In the BA District, Off-street Parking in front of 
Buildings should be limited to a depth (from the 
Front Lot Line to the Front Building Line) of one 
double-loaded parking bay, or about sixty (60) to 
seventy (70) ft. However, a deeper parking area 
is acceptable when the access way separating 
the parking area from the main Building 
entrance is designed as a “Complete Street” 
with sidewalks on each side, on-street parking 
(where possible), street trees, and marked 
pedestrian crossings. 

C. Design and Arrangement of Buildings.  

1. Adequate provision shall be made for light, air, access 
and privacy in the arrangement of Buildings to each 
other. Each living space shall have sufficient exterior 
exposures. 

2. All Buildings in the layout and design shall be an 
integral part of the development and have convenient 
access to and from Adjacent uses. 

3. Individual Buildings shall be related to each other in 
design, massing, materials, placement and 
connections to provide a visually and physically 
integrated development. 

4. The design of Buildings and the parking facilities shall 
take advantage of the natural features and 
topography of the project site, where appropriate.  

5. All Building walls shall be oriented to ensure adequate 
light and air exposures to the rooms within. 

6. All Buildings shall be arranged so as to avoid undue 
exposure to concentrated Loading or parking facilities 
wherever possible and shall be oriented to preserve 
visual and audible privacy between Adjacent 
Buildings. 

7. All Buildings shall be arranged to be accessible to 
emergency vehicles. 

D. Storm Drainage. The Site Plan must provide for the 
adequate disposal of storm water runoff in a manner 
that will not contribute to flooding or erosion of Adjacent 
properties or streets and will not carry pollutants onto 
the beaches. 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

16-2 
 

E. Conformity with Provisions of Codes and Ordinances. 
All development shown on the Site Plan must conform 
to the requirements of this Ordinance, the Subdivision 
Regulations, the Building Code, and other applicable 
ordinances. 

F. Architectural Restrictions. The following architectural 
standards shall apply throughout the City or as 
otherwise described herein. Upon a showing of special 
need, critical function, or exceptional design, alternative 
materials may be approved through the Site Plan 
approval process. 

1. Novelty Architecture. Any use that incorporates 
Novelty Architecture, regardless of its GFA, shall be 
considered a Conditional Use and require a 
Conditional Use Permit under Section 3-4. 

2. Building Materials. Within the following zoning 
districts, Building Façades shall be composed of 
stucco, brick, scored concrete, split-face concrete 
block, wood, or a combination of these materials:  

a. Any Residential, Business, or planned unit 
development district 

b. Any Non-residential district; except BA-zoned 
properties located 500 ft or more from State 
Highway 59 

c. INST District 

d. ICW-N and ICW-S Districts 

No more than twenty-five (25) percent of any 
Façade shall be composed of metal siding. On 
exterior Building walls not facing a Thoroughfare, 
no more than fifty (50) percent of the wall area 
shall be composed of metal siding; however, this 
shall not apply to residential Accessory Structures 
less than 200 sf in size.  

 

Encouraged use of materials. 

 

 

Discouraged use of materials. 

3. Within the IND District and BA-zoned properties not 
subject to §16-1F1 above, Buildings shall be designed 
subject to the following: 

a. All metal Buildings shall, irrespective of location, 
have an architectural Façade on any elevation 
Adjacent to a public Thoroughfare or ROW. 
Façades shall be composed of metal, vinyl, 
stucco, brick, scored concrete, split-face 
concrete Block, wood, or a combination of these 
materials, provided however that not more than 
forty (40) percent shall be composed of metal 
siding. 

b. The materials used for Facades shall extend for 
a minimum of ten (10) ft along building 
elevations not Adjacent to a Thoroughfare. All 
other exterior walls shall be composed of metal, 
vinyl, stucco, brick, scored and/or split-face 
concrete Block, wood, or a combination of these 
materials, provided however that not more than 
seventy (70) percent shall be composed of 
metal siding. 

4. In the ATP District, metal-sided Accessory Buildings 
are permitted if located within non-public or patron 
areas and are fully screened from off-site. Any 
exterior Building walls visible from a public ROW or 
on-site public or patron area shall be composed of 
metal, vinyl, brick, scored concrete, split-face concrete 
Block, wood, or a combination of these, provided 
however that not more than fifty (50) percent of any 
exterior wall shall be composed of either metal or vinyl 
siding.  

5. Treatment of the sides and rear of all Buildings within 
the development shall be comparable in amenity and 
appearance to the treatment given to their Façades. 
However, in cases where Buildings are permitted to 
abut another Building along a Side Lot Line, Building 
walls erected at the Side Lot Line may have more 
modest design treatments. 

6. Building disposition.  See Envision Gulf Shores 
Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 18, 24, 
and 25. 

a. To the extent permitted within the district, Non-
residential and Mixed-use Buildings should be 

 

 



 

 

 16-3 Article 16: Site Plan Review   

located at the back of the public sidewalk 
aligned lengthwise along the primary frontage. 

b. Principal Buildings shall have their primary 
entrances along a public Thoroughfare or public 
pedestrian way, such as a boardwalk. 

7. Vertical Massing and Modulation. Multi-storied 
Buildings shall incorporate architectural Modulation of 
the elevation and   Building profile. Such Buildings 
should have a “base”, “middle”, and “cap” 
differentiated through changes in material and color, 
amount and proportion of Fenestration, belt courses 
and projecting cornices. Additional Modulation shall 
be achieved through architectural features such as 
arcades, colonnades, Awnings, canopies and 
balconies, and through multiple offsets in vertical 
planes such that a number of upper floors are smaller 
than floors below. Irregular roof profiles are also 
encouraged. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay 
District Design Guidelines Illustrations 25 and 31. 

a. The base is that portion of the Façade enclosing 
the lowest floor(s) of the Building and, when 
containing Non-residential uses, should provide 
an attractive storefront appearance with a 
minimum of fifty (50) percent Fenestration 
(including entrances). Finish materials should 
appear substantial, giving the impression of 
being thicker or heavier than that of upper 
floors. Shade and weather protection should be 
considered and may be provided through 
arcades, Awnings, or canopies. See Envision 
Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines 
Illustrations 24, 26 and 27. 

 
Building with base, middle, and cap composition. 

 

b. The middle is that portion of the Façade 
between the base and the uppermost floor or 
cornice and should generally have vertically-
proportioned windows although multiple 
windows within the same structural opening may 
have a horizontal proportion. 

c. The cap is that portion of the Façade enclosing 
the uppermost floor(s) of the Building (for 
Buildings with pitched roofs) or the uppermost 
floors and/or cornice (for flat roof Buildings). The 

cap should be accentuated through a change in 
masonry patterns, materials, colors, a horizontal 
band dividing the middle from the cap, or a 
combination of these. For flat roof Buildings, the 
cap should include a well-articulated cornice 
proportionate with the overall size of the 
Building (see also Item 7 Roofs following). 

8. Horizontal Massing and Modulation. See Envision 
Gulf Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines 
Illustrations 30. 

a. Building s set back from the street by an Off-
street Parking area should incorporate 
Modulation of the Façade(s) and Massing. 
Modulation shall be achieved with changes in 
Building materials and projections and/or 
recesses and roof profiles every fifty (50) ft or 
less spacing projections and recesses should be 
a minimum of two (2) ft, measured in plan view. 

 
Modulation 

 

b. Buildings built up to a public sidewalk, where 
permitted, should maintain a consistent edge 
along the sidewalk and have relatively shallow 
projections and recesses, although Modulation 
in upper floors is desirable as well as variety in 
Façade materials that accentuate the base, 
middle, and cap elements of the Façade. 

 

 

 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

16-4 
 

Building with entrance(s) oriented to public sidewalk. 

 

9. In the Walking Area Overlay District, the first level of 
Buildings above base flood elevation (BFE) facing 
Gulf Shores Pkwy., Beach Blvd., and 1st Ave. shall 
consist of retail and Commercial Uses directly 
accessible from sidewalks. No less than forty (40) 
percent of the Façades of such uses shall consist of 
clear glass. See Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District 
Design Guidelines Illustrations 11, 14, 26, and 33. 

10. Fenestration. For Buildings over five (5) Stories in 
height, maximum Fenestration and open balconies on 
upper floors are encouraged. Blank Walls, as defined 
in Article 4, may not constitute more than forty (40) 
percent of any Façade. 

 

Buildings with high percentage of Fenestration 
and balconies on upper floors 

11. Parking Structures shall be reviewed for consistency 
with Envision Gulf Shores Overlay District Design 
Guidelines 28 and 29. The Façades of Parking 
Structures shall either be lined with retail storefronts 
or finished with masonry Façades that repeat the 
expression of, (having similar materials, structural 
elements, and size and proportions of openings) the 
occupied Stories of the Façade. Parking Structures 
should be lined with habitable spaces. Retail and 
Service Uses are recommended at ground level along 
the street. In upper floors, Office or residential uses 
are encouraged. Where such liner uses are not 
practicable, the Parking Structure’s Façade should be 
finished with materials and details consistent with any 
occupied portions of the Building or neighboring 
Buildings. Openings in the Façade of the Parking 
Structure shall be filled with decorative panels or 
louvers that allow natural ventilation but screen the 
view of parked automobiles within. See Envision Gulf 
Shores Overlay District Design Guidelines Illustrations 
28 and 29. 

 

Parking deck with liner Building along street 

 

12. Roofs. 

a. Pitched roofs are encouraged. Pitched roofs 
should be constructed with textured shingles of 
fiberglass composition, wood shingles, or 
standing seam metal or other materials 
approved by the Approving Authority. 

b. Flat roofs are acceptable but should incorporate 
distinctive cornice features or similar 
architectural articulation of the roof. The height 
and depth of such element should increase with 
the height of the Building. 

13. The above provisions of this Subsection are intended 
to serve as a guide to prospective developers or 
builders and are not intended to be all-inclusive. 
Additional design considerations may be generated 
through the Site Plan Review. 

§16-2. Additional Site Plan Requirements in Specified 
Districts 

Site Plan applications within the Beach Area Overlay 
District, Walking Area Overlay District, Lagoon Pass, 
and Plash Island/Bon Secour River Overlay Districts 
shall be subject to the following additional 
requirements. 

A. Contents of Application. All Site Plan applications shall 
be accompanied by materials required by the CDD for 
Site Plan Review. 

B. Multi-modal Access Plan. The Multi-modal Access Plan 
shall be submitted along with the required Site Plan. The 
Multi-modal Access Plan shall be a plan drawn at a 
scale of 1”= 50’ and shall include the subject property 
along with Adjacent Thoroughfares, intersections and 
Buildings located on Parcels on the same Block. The 
Multi-Modal Access Plan will indicate pedestrian and 
vehicular connections from Thoroughfares, sidewalks 
and multi-use paths surrounding the subject property to 
the entrances of all occupied Buildings within the subject 
property. Convenient pedestrian ways shall be shown 
from sidewalks along Thoroughfares to each Building 
entrance, including designated pedestrian access routes 
across parking lots and between Adjacent Buildings 
within the same development. Where an existing or 
planned multi-use path is located within 700 ft of the 

 

 



 

 

 16-5 Article 16: Site Plan Review   

subject property, the access plan shall show how safe, 
continuous and convenient bicycle access may be 
provided to the subject property. 

C. Traffic Impact Study. A Traffic Impact Study is required 
for developments with more than 200 PM peak hour 
trips according to the most recent edition of the ITE Trip 
Generation Handbook. The traffic impact study shall be 
submitted along with the required Site Plan and the 
scope and analysis of the Traffic Impact Study shall 
follow the procedures of the APA Planning Advisory 
Service Report Number 387, Traffic Impact Analysis and 
other requirements of the City Department of Public 
Works.

§17-1. Board of Zoning Adjustment.  

The Board of Zoning Adjustment, hereinafter referred 
to as the “BZA”, consists of five members and two 
supernumerary members appointed by the Council. 
Each member is appointed for a term of three (3) 
years. Members of the BZA may be removed for 
cause by the Council upon written charges and after 
public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the 
unexpired term of any member whose term becomes 
vacant.  

§17-2. Procedure. 

A. Rules. The BZA shall establish rules for its operation not 
inconsistent with applicable state statutes or this 
Ordinance. 

B. Officers. The BZA shall elect a chairman and vice-
chairman from among its members. The chairman shall 
be the presiding officer of the board and the vice-
chairman shall be the presiding officer in the chairman's 
absence or disqualification. The terms of all officers 
shall be for one (1) year, with eligibility for reelection. 

C. Minutes and Records. The BZA shall keep minutes of its 
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon 
each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating 
such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations 
and of other official actions, all of which shall 
immediately be filed in the office of the Board and shall 
be a public record. 

D. Meetings Open to Public. All meetings of the BZA shall

§17-3. Powers and Duties.  

The BZA shall have the following powers and duties 
when considering matters within its jurisdiction as 
defined by state statutes and this Ordinance:  

A. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is 
error in any order, requirement, decision or 
determination made by an administrative official in the 
enforcement of this Ordinance; and, 

B. Authorize upon appeal in specific cases such Variances 
from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary 
to the public interest, where owing to special conditions 
a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance 
will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit 
of this Ordinance shall be observed and substantial 
justice done. 

§17-4. Appeals.  

Appeals to the BZA may be taken by any person 
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or 
bureau of the municipality affected by any decision of 
the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be made 
within thirty (30) days after rendition of the order, 
requirement, decision or determination appealed from 
in writing to the BZA and file same and two (2) copies 
of supporting facts and data with the CDD. This does 
not, however, restrict the filing of a request for a 
Variance by any person at any time as provided for 
elsewhere in this Article. 

A. Procedure. Upon receipt of said appeal, the CDD may 
forthwith examine such appeal or request application 
and endorse a recommendation thereon together with 
all documents, plans, papers or other materials 
constituting the record to the City Attorney for his review 
and opinion. The CDD shall present the City Attorney’s 
opinion to the BZA as to whether or not the subject of 
the appeal falls within the jurisdiction of the BZA, all 
accompanying information, and a recommendation for 
action prior to a decision being made by the BZA. 

B. Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in 
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the 
officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the 
BZA, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with 
him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate of 
stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or 
property. Such proceedings shall not be stayed 
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be 
granted by the BZA or by a court of record on 
application of notice to the officer from which the appeal 
is taken and on due cause shown. 

C. Decision. The concurring vote of four (4) members of 
the BZA shall be necessary to reverse any order, 
requirement, decision or determination of the 
administrative official or to decide in favor of the 
appellant in respect to any matter upon which the BZA 
can legally act. 

D. Hearing on Appeal. Before rendering a decision upon an 
appeal, the BZA shall hold a public hearing in accord 
with §17-2D Meetings Open to Public for which a 
reasonable time shall be set. Public notice of the 
hearing shall be given as well as due notice to the 
parties in interest. The BZA may require the person 
appealing to send certified mail receipted notice to the 
property owners within a reasonable area not to exceed 
a distance of 1,000 ft from the property involved. The 
guide for the mailing requirement to owners may be the 
most current city or county assessment role. At the 
hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or 
by attorney. With respect to Condominiums or 
cooperatives, notices required by this section may be 
sent to each, the secretary and the president of the 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

17-8 
 

Condominium or cooperative association, unless such 
offices are not filled in which event notice to the agent 
designated for the service of process will be sufficient 
for compliance with the notice requirements of this 
section. 

§17-5. Variances.  

A. Limitation of Variances. Establishment or expansion of a 
use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by 
Variance, nor shall a Variance be granted because of 
the presence of non-conformities in the zoning district or 
uses in an Adjacent zoning district. 

B. Requirements for Issuance of Variances. To authorize 
any Variance from the terms of this Ordinance, the BZA 
must hold a public hearing in accord with §17-2D 
Meetings Open to Public and shall find that all of the 
following conditions exist/apply: 

1. That the granting of the Variance will not be contrary 
to the public interest; 

2. That the literal enforcement of the Ordinance will 
result in unnecessary hardship by reason of 
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, 
topography or other extraordinary or exceptional 
physical situation or physical condition unique to the 
specific piece of property in question; unnecessary 
hardship shall mean physical hardship relating to the 
property itself as distinguished from a hardship 
relating to convenience, financial considerations or 
caprice, and the hardship must not result from the 
applicant or property owner's own actions; 

3. That granting the Variance requested will not confer 
on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by 
this Ordinance to other lands, Buildings, or Structures 
in the same zoning district; 

4. That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this 
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights 
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same 
zoning district under the terms of this Ordinance; 

5. That the Variance granted is the minimum Variance 
that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, 
Building or Structure; 

6. That granting the Variance shall not permit a use in a 
zoning district which prohibits that use; and, 

7. That the granting of the Variance will be in harmony 
with the general intent and purpose of this Ordinance, 
and that such Variance will not be injurious to the area 
involved or otherwise detrimental to the public 
welfare. 

C. Burden of Proof. The burden of proving to the BZA that 
the foregoing conditions have been met is upon the 
applicant. 

D. Conditions. In granting any Variance, the BZA may 
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in 
conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of such 
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the 
terms under which the Variance is granted, shall be 
deemed a violation of this Ordinance. 

E. Effect of Variances. Variances, unless specifically 
conditioned by the BZA, shall run with the land. A 
variance granted by the Board shall lapse and be of no 
effect if, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date 
of such action by the Board, no permit pursuant to such 
variance has been issued by the City. The Board may, 
for good cause shown, place specific conditions on the 
expiration and required action by the applicant in 
conjunction with its approval to grant the variance. In 
such cases and where conditions established by the 
BZA have not been met, the Variance shall become null 
and void and the application shall be reheard, with any 
new information or findings as appropriate, prior to 
approval.  

§17-6. Judicial Remedy by Circuit Court.  

Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision 
of the BZA, or by a decision of the City Attorney that 
the BZA has no jurisdiction, may apply to the Circuit 
Court for judicial relief within the time period as 
provided in Title 11-52-81, Code of Alabama, as 
amended.  

  
 



 

 

 18-1 Article 18: Sign Regulations   

ARTICLE 18: SIGN REGULATIONS 

§18-1.  Purpose.  

A. The purpose of these regulations is to provide minimum 
control of signs to promote the health, safety and 
general welfare; to avoid congestion on the public 
streets and roads; and to preserve property values: by 
preventing unsightly and detrimental development that 
would detract from the tourist resort appeal of the 
community and lead to economic decline and blight, by 
preventing signs from reaching such excessive size or 
numbers that they obscure one another to the detriment 
of all concerned and by securing certain fundamentals 
of design that would strengthen the community's 
economic base.  

§18-2.  General Sign Regulations.  

A. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article, 
signs shall be permitted only as accessory or 
appurtenant to an existing or approved Principal Use or 
Structure on the same property. The following 
regulations apply generally to all signs and are in 
addition to the regulations established for each District 
or the regulations contained elsewhere in this 
Ordinance. 

B. Permit Required. No sign, unless herein excepted, shall 
be erected, constructed, posted, painted, altered, 
maintained, or relocated until a permit has been issued 
by the Community Development Department (CDD) 
Before any permit has been issued, an application shall 
be filed together with such drawings and specifications 
as may be necessary to fully advise and acquaint the 
Zoning Official with the location, height, size, 
construction, materials, manner of illuminating, and 
securing or fastening, and number of signs applied for 
and the wording of the sign or advertisement to be 
carried on the sign. Information shall be provided for 
existing as well as proposed signs. Changing the copy 
on a bulletin board, poster board, display encasement, 
or marquee, including the substitution of non-
commercial messages for existing commercial 
messages, shall not require a permit. 

C. Staff review. The Zoning Official shall review all sign 
permit applications for compliance with this Ordinance. 
Because signs are so nearly a part of the premises to 
which they are attached or pertain, the Zoning Official 
shall assure, through the review process, that signs are 
appropriately fit to, and are not incompatible with, their 
host premises. Only upon finding that all proposed signs 
are in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance 
shall the Zoning Official cause to be issued a sign permit 
upon payment of the appropriate fee. 

D. Fees. Each sign permit application shall be 
accompanied by payment of a permit fee, as established 

by resolution of the City Council. This fee shall defray 
the cost of processing sign permit applications, and shall 
be charged in addition to any building permit fee, 
electrical permit fee, or any other fee associated with the 
approval of a proposed or existing development. 

E. Time limitation, sign permit. If the work authorized under 
a sign permit has not been completed within six (6) 
months following the date of issuance, such permit shall 
become null and void and any partial construction 
removed by the permittee. 

F. Revocation. The Zoning Official is authorized and 
empowered to revoke any sign permit upon failure of the 
permit holder to comply with any provision of this 
Ordinance. 

G. Exempt Signs. The following signs may be erected or 
constructed without a Sign Permit but shall be in

City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

18-10 
 

§18-3. Master Signage Plan.  

A. A Master Signage Plan (MSP) is designed to benefit the 
community in administering its sign regulations. The 
purpose of such a plan is twofold. (1) It provides a 
Master Plan for all signs on a Premises; and (2) It 
provides a Master Record of all signs on a Premises 
This provides the Zoning Official with information about 
existing signs on a site when considering a permit 
application for a new sign and also eliminates the need 
to recompute permitted Sign Area and numbers for a 
property every time a sign administration or enforcement 
question arises. By requiring planning and coordination 
of signs on a property, the streetscape will improve 
though strict and detailed substantive requirements are 
not imposed. 

It is, in a sense, a PUD for signs and imposes 
minimum area requirements so that it will only apply 
to large developments where a large number of 
signs will be present. It can be used as an incentive 
by rewarding developers who prepare and follow 
coordinated signage plans for the property. The 
provisions of the plan impose no maximum amounts 
of signage on the Premises as a whole and also 
provides for a common Detached Sign, which could 
be larger than is normally allowed. The standards 
for signage in the applicable zoning districts shall be 
used as a guideline during the approval process, but 
certain deviations may be made depending upon the 
intensity and scope of the development if it is 
determined by the Zoning Official that the deviations 
are in keeping with the intent of this Section. The 
intent of the MSP is to develop a creative approach 
to satisfying reasonable sign needs and not simply a 
means of requesting or receiving greater sign area 
or larger signs. 

 

B. Criteria for Consideration of a MSP. The provisions as    
set forth in this section may be used in lieu of the 
provisions for signage in the BG, BA, IND, ICW, ATP 
and PUD Districts only when all of the following criteria 
apply: 

1. The development area for which a MSP is filed shall 
be at least ten (10) acres. 

2. The use for which a MSP is filed shall be 
characterized as either a campus, industrial park, 
office park, Amusement Park, shopping center, 
Mixed-use development, planned residential 
community, public or semi-public use, or a phase 
thereof. 

3. The Premises has at least 200 ft of Lot Frontage 
along a public Thoroughfare. 

C. Sign Permits. No Sign Permit shall be issued for any 
signs within a proposed MSP-designated area or a 
phase thereof unless and until a MSP for the Premises 
has been submitted to the Zoning Official and approved 
as conforming with this section. 

D. MSP Submission Requirements. For any project or 
property wishing to take advantage of this section, the 
owner(s) shall submit to the  Zoning Official an MSP 
application containing the following: 

1. An accurate plot plan of the Premises at such a scale 
as the  Zoning Official may reasonably require, 
showing: 

a. Location of Buildings, parking lots, Driveways 
and landscaped areas; 

b. An accurate indication on the plot plan of the 
proposed location of each present and future

c. Computation of the total Sign Area, the area of 
each individual sign, the height of signs, and an 
outline of the Building Façades for which signs 
will be mounted. This shall include all signs 
permitted for the applicable district and any 
additional signage area requested through the 
MSP. 

E. Master Signage Plan Review. A Master Signage Plan 
application may be submitted with any Site Plan, PUD 
plan, or other Official plan required by the City 
(excluding Building Permits, Land Disturbing Activity 
Permits, etc.) for the proposed development and shall 
be processed simultaneously with such other 
applications. For developments containing more than 
one phase, site or Premises, a MSP shall be required 
for each site or Premises upon development. 

F. Amendment. A Master Signage Plan may be amended 
by filing a new Master Signage Plan with the Council 
that conforms with all requirements of the ordinance 
then in effect. 

G. Binding Effect. After approval of a Master Signage Plan, 
no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, 
except in conformance with such plan, and such plan 
may be enforced in the same way as any provision of 
this Ordinance.

or resurfaced by the owner or lessee within the same 
thirty (30) day time period, so that the sign will not

any other device for visual communication that would 
pertain to the activity formerly associated with the

§18-5. Nonconforming Signs. 

A. Effective Date of Nonconformity. For purposes of this 
Section, the term "effective date of nonconformity" with 
respect to a sign shall mean: 

1. May 10, 1982, for any sign existing within the 
corporate limits of the City as such limits existed on 
May 10, 1982, which was rendered nonconforming by 
the enactment of Ordinance No. 235; 

2. the effective date of this Ordinance (No# 1584) and 
any subsequent amendment thereto, for any sign first 
rendered nonconforming by this Ordinance or such 
amendment thereto; 

3. the effective date of annexation, for any sign first 
rendered nonconforming by the annexation of its site 
into the corporate limits of the City on a date 
subsequent to May 10, 1982. 

B. Limitations on Continuance. Except as otherwise 
provided, all legally existing Nonconforming signs 
(except Moveable Signs), which lawfully existed prior to 



 

 

 18-13 Article 18: Sign Regulations   

the effective date of nonconformity may continue to 
lawfully exist; provided, however, signs which are 
determined by the Zoning Official to have been 
structurally damaged or deteriorated by any cause 
including age to the extent of more than fifty (50) 
percent of their current cost of replacement shall be 
either removed or altered so as to comply with the 
provisions of this Ordinance. The continued use of 
legally existing nonconforming signs shall further be 
limited according to the following provisions: 

1. A nonconforming sign shall not, after the effective 
date of this Ordinance, be enlarged, structurally 
altered, or extended unless such sign shall be made 
to comply with all the provisions of this Ordinance. 
Another nonconforming sign may not replace a 
nonconforming sign. Minor repairs and maintenance 
of nonconforming signs, such as repainting and 
electrical repairs, shall be permitted. However, no 
changes in the location, size, or shape of any 
nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make 
the sign comply with all provisions of this Ordinance. 

2. If not sooner removed or altered in accordance with 
Item 1 above, any legally existing nonconforming sign 
(other than a movable sign) shall be either removed or 
altered so as to comply with the provisions of this 
Ordinance within ten (10) years after its effective date 
of nonconformity. 

3. All legally existing nonconforming Moveable Signs 
shall be removed within ninety (90) days after the 
effective date of nonconformity. Any nonconforming 
sign for which just compensation us required for 
removal by the Federal Highway Beautification Act or 
the Highway Beautification Act—Outdoor Advertising 
of the State of Alabama shall be exempted from the 
terms of removal or limitations on continuance of this 
Ordinance. However, this shall not preclude the City 
from seeking to remove any such sign through other 
lawful means. 

C. Restriction on Additional Signs. No permits for additional 
signs shall be issued for any Premises on which there 
are any nonconforming signs. 

D. Restrictions on Off-Premise Signs. No nonconforming 
sign may be altered from one format to another. Such 
signs may not be enlarged, extended, or substantially 
improved, and in no case may one be altered from a flat 
display to a tri-panel display or to an electronic LED 
display, or modified in any other way. Said signs shall 
be maintained only in the condition they existed upon 
their becoming nonconforming. 

E. Compensation. 

1. The owner of a legally existing nonconforming sign 
subject to removal pursuant to §18-5B2 and made 
subject to a written notice of violation by the Zoning 

Official may file a sworn claim with the Zoning Official 
for any compensation the owner contends is allowed 
by law for the removal of such sign. In the case of a 
General Advertising Sign, an owner of real property 
who derives revenue from a lease or license of such 
property to the owner of a sign shall separately be 
considered an owner for the purpose of compensation 
under this §18-7E. Upon the filing of such a claim 
prior to the removal of such sign, the Zoning Official 
may, in his discretion, suspend the operation of the 
Notice to Cease and Desist pending consideration of 
the claim. Such claim shall document: 

a. the legal basis on which such compensation is 
claimed; 

b. the date and original cost of erection of the sign; 

c. the depreciated value of the sign as reflected on 
the books and records of the owner as of the 
effective date of the nonconformity; 

d. the depreciated value of the sign as reflected on 
the books and records of the owner as of the 
date of removal of the sign, or as of the date of 
affixing of the Notice to Cease and Desist to the 
sign, if removal has not been effected; 

e. the current reasonable salvage value of the sign 
materials, if any; 

f. the complete terms and duration of any lease or 
contract regarding such sign to which the owner 
was party on the date of removal or the date of 
the Notice to Cease and Desist, if removal has 
not been effected; and 

g. a statement of the actual or anticipated cost of 
removal of the sign, supported by the invoice or 
bid of a contractor licensed to do business in the 
City or, if removal has been or will be performed 
by the owner, supported by the sworn cost 
statement of the owner. 

2. In processing a claim for compensation, the Zoning 
Official shall first secure the written opinion of the City 
Attorney as to whether or not the claimant has 
presented an appropriate legal basis for a claim of 
compensation. If the City Attorney's opinion is other 
than that an appropriate legal basis is not presented, 
the Zoning Official shall render a determination as to 
the appropriate compensation payable to the claimant 
by the City upon removal. Unless the opinion of the 
City Attorney otherwise directs, the standards to be 
applied by the  Zoning Official shall include the 
following: 

a. an award component equal to the depreciated 
value of the sign as reflected on the books and 
records of the owner as of the date of removal 
or, if not yet removed, as of the date of the 



City of Gulf Shores Zoning Ordinance  

18-14 
 

Notice to Cease and Desist provided the sign 
has been depreciated by the owner using 
generally accepted accounting principles, less 
the reasonable salvage value of the sign 
materials, if any; 

b. an award component equal to the present value 
of the net revenue realizable but unrealized by 
the owner during the remaining term of any 
lease or contract with respect to the sign (A) in 
effect on the date of removal or the date of the 
Notice to Cease and Desist, if removal has not 
been effected, and (B) entered into prior to the 
effective date of nonconformity, with the 
remaining term measured to the earliest date a 
party other than the owner could elect to 
terminate such lease or contract on a basis 
other than default by the owner; 

c. an award component equal to the reasonable 
cost to the owner of removal of the sign. 

Any unauthorized improvements made to a 
Nonconforming sign in contradiction to this 
Ordinance shall not be taken into account in a 
claim for compensation. 

 
3. The written determination of the Zoning Official with 

respect to the award of compensation shall be 
transmitted to the owner by first class mail directed to 
the address specified by the owner in the owner's 
claim and to the City Clerk and shall be deemed 
rendered on the date of deposit into the U.S. Mail. In 
the case of a sign whose removal has not yet been 
effected, the City Clerk shall advise the Zoning Official 
in writing within twenty-one (21) days after the date on 
which the  Official's written determination is rendered 
whether the City agrees to pay the award of 
compensation as determined upon removal of the 
sign, intends to appeal the determination as provided 
in Paragraph 4 below, or requests that the Notice to 
Cease and Desist with respect to the sign be 
withdrawn until such time as the City gives written 
notice of its request for a new determination of the 
award of compensation. The Zoning Official shall 
transmit a copy of the City Clerk's written advice to 
the owner by first class mail as provided above. 

4. The determination of the Zoning Official may be 
appealed to the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Any 
party aggrieved by the final judgment or decision of 
the Board of Zoning Adjustment or by the decision of 
the City Attorney that an appropriate legal basis for a 
compensation claim has not been presented, may 
apply to the Circuit Court for judicial relief within the 
time period as provided in Section 11-52-81 of the 
Code of Alabama, as amended. 

5. In the event of an appeal of the Official's 
determination by any party aggrieved, the operation of 
any Notice to Cease and Desist then in effect shall be 
and remain suspended until no appeal to the Board of 
Zoning Adjustment or to any court remains pending. 
Upon final determination of the award of 
compensation in the appeals process, the City Clerk 
shall advise the Zoning Official in writing within 
twenty-one (21) days after the date of final 
determination whether City agrees to pay the award of 
compensation as finally determined upon removal of 
the sign or the City requests that the Notice to Cease 
and Desist with respect to the sign be withdrawn until 
such time as the City gives written notice of its 
request for a new determination of the award of 
compensation. Upon receipt of such latter request, the 
Zoning Official shall withdraw the Notice to Cease and 
Desist and shall give the owner written notice of such 
withdrawal by first class mail as provided above.
