CITY OF AUBURN ZONING ORDINANCE 
 
 
AN ORDINANCE in pursuance of the authority granted by Title 11, Chapter 52, Articles 1 through 4 
inclusive, of the 1975 Code of Alabama, to provide the establishment of districts within the corporate limits 
of the City of Auburn, Alabama; to regulate within such districts the height, number of stories and size of 
buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards and other open 
spaces, the density of population and the use of buildings, structures, and land; to repeal all existing Zoning 
Ordinances and to provide methods of administration of this Ordinance and penalties for the violation 
thereof. 
 
THE PUBLIC WELFARE REQUIRING IT, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Auburn, as 
follows: 
 

ARTICLE I.   TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION. 
 
Section 100.  Title. 
 
This Ordinance shall be known as and may be referred to as the “Auburn Zoning Ordinance,” and includes 
maps of the City that depict the boundaries of zoning districts. 
 
 
Section 101.  Legislative Intent. 
 
In enacting the Zoning Ordinance, special notice has been taken of the fact that the goals of citizens and 
landowners of Auburn often conflict or compete.  In the light of this situation, the first consideration has 
been to devise technical solutions, which minimize or eliminate conflicts. 
 
This Ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate both competing interests.  This has 
inevitably, and properly, led to some form of compromise.  In arriving at these compromises, every 
possible consideration has been given to the public interest, individual property rights, and externalities.  
While compromise implies mutual concessions or losses, it also implies – and this Ordinance has been 
designed to provide – mutual gains and benefits.  It is the goal of this Ordinance that both the burdens and 
the benefits it implies are rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property owners of 
Auburn. 
 
Every effort has been made to make uses a matter of right subject to performance criteria capable of 
nondiscretionary, objective administrative evaluations, thus reducing the number of times that rezoning 
decisions need be made.  This greatly increases the potential uses or choices available to individual 
property owners.  The rezoning decisions that conventional zoning ordinances frequently necessitate appear 
to reduce the certainty of protection to neighbors and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to 
Auburn.  This Ordinance contains performance criteria intended to insure that neighbors are protected from 
adverse impacts.  The Ordinance also contains performance criteria to protect the community’s general 
welfare.  Zoning districts are few in number, and each has a clearly different purpose.  Distinctions among 
zoning districts are based upon the City’s Comprehensive Plan.  The districts are sized to be adequate to 
handle Auburn’s long-term needs and must be regularly updated as time passes.  Where performance 
criteria severely limit the use of properties, the Ordinance has gone to considerable extremes to provide the 
landowners with a range of choices, flexibility, and options for development. 
 
 
Section 102.  Purpose. 
 
The purpose of this Ordinance is the promotion of the health, safety, and general welfare of the present and 
future inhabitants of Auburn by: 
 

 I-1



102.01. Giving effect to the policies and proposals set forth in the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 
 
102.02. Providing methods to preserve and maintain a healthful environment for the benefit of 

present and future generations by providing standards to control the amount of open 
space and impervious surfaces within a development; to control the intensity of 
development in areas of sensitive natural resources or natural features in order to reduce 
or eliminate adverse environmental impacts. 

 
102.03. Controlling and regulating the growth of Auburn, concentrating development in areas 

where adequate sewerage facilities, roads, and schools can be provided, and limiting 
development in areas where these facilities are not and should not be provided. 

 
102.04. Regulating and restricting the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, 

industry, residences, and other uses. 
 

102.05. Providing standards for all types of dwelling units so that all the people may have access 
to decent, sound, and sanitary housing in accordance with the goals of the Federal 
Housing Act of 1949, among which is the provision of adequate zoning to meet a fair 
share of the region’s housing needs. 

 
102.06. Lessening the danger of congestion of traffic on the roads and highways, limiting 

excessive numbers of intersections, driveways, and other friction points, minimizing 
other hazards, and insuring the continued usefulness of all elements of the existing 
highway system for their planned function. 

 
102.07. Securing safety from fire, panic, flood, and other dangers. 

 
102.08. Providing adequate privacy, light, and air. 

 
102.09. Securing economy in local governmental expenditures. 

 
102.10. Conserving property values throughout Auburn. 

 
102.11. Protecting landowners from adverse impacts of adjoining developments. 

 
102.12. Dividing the incorporated area of Auburn into districts according to the use of land and 

buildings, the intensity of such uses (including bulk and height), and surrounding open 
space. 

 
Each purpose listed above serves to balance the interest of the general public of Auburn and those of 
individual property owners. 
 
 
Section 103.  Jurisdiction. 
 
This Ordinance shall apply to all areas within the corporate limits of the City of Auburn, Alabama.  No 
building or land shall hereafter be used, and no building or part thereof shall be erected, moved, or altered 
unless for a use expressly permitted by and in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the 
district in which it is located, except as herein provided.   
 
 
Section 104.  Interpretation and Purpose 
 
In their interpretation and application the provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered the minimum 
requirements to promote and preserve the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and 
general welfare of the community.  Where other ordinances or regulations impose greater restrictions than 

 I-2



those specified in this Ordinance, compliance with such other ordinances and regulations shall be 
mandatory. 
 
Application of the provisions of this Ordinance shall not lower the restrictions of plats, deeds, or private 
contracts if such are greater than the provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
The provisions of this Ordinance are not intended to abrogate, annul, or otherwise interfere with any 
easement, covenant, or private agreement; provided, however, that where the provisions of this Ordinance 
are more restrictive or impose higher standards the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply. 
 
 
Section 105.  Severability 
 
If any section, clause, or provision of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any 
court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, provision or portion 
of this Ordinance which is not in and of itself invalid or unconstitutional. 
 
 
Section 106.  Effective Date 
 
This Ordinance shall become effective upon its adoption, approval, and publication as required by law, and 
shall be codified in the Code of Auburn, Alabama; and upon such date all zoning ordinances heretofore 
adopted shall be and are hereby repealed.

ARTICLE III.   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
Section 300.  Establishment of Zoning Districts. 
 
The City of Auburn, Alabama is hereby divided into zoning districts of such number and character as are 
necessary to achieve compatibility of uses within each district, to implement the Official Zoning Map of 
Auburn, and to serve the other purposes of this Ordinance, which are detailed in Article I. 
 
Section 301.  Zoning Districts. 
 
For the purpose of this Ordinance, all land and water areas in Auburn are hereby divided into zoning districts,

Section 302.  Map of Zoning Districts. 
 
Zoning districts established by this Ordinance are bounded and defined as shown on the Official Zoning Map 
of Auburn, which, together with all explanatory materials contained thereon, is hereby made a part of this 
Ordinance. 
 
Section 303.  Interpretation of District Boundaries. 
 
The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any zone boundary shown on the 
Official Zoning Map of Auburn: 
 
303.01. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the limits of any municipal corporation 
shall be construed as following such limits. 
 
303.02. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets shall be construed to follow the 
centerlines of such streets. 
 
303.03. Boundary lines which follow or approximately follow platted lot lines or other property lines as 
shown on the Auburn Tax Maps shall be construed as following such lines. 
 
303.04. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following section lines, half-section lines, or 
quarter-section lines shall be construed as following such lines.

shall be construed as moving with the actual mean high waterline. 
 
303.07. Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, or other 
continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following the channel centerline of such water 
courses taken at mean low water.  In the event of a natural change in the location of such streams, rivers, or 
other watercourses, the zone boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. 



III-2 
 

303.08. Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any of the features 
listed in paragraphs 303.01 through 303.07 above shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at 
such distances therefrom as are shown on the map. 
 
Section 304.  Statement of Purpose and Intent of Zoning Districts. 
 
The following sections specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance. 
 
304.01. Urban Core District (UC).   This District is intended to serve as the retail, financial, service, 
historical and religious focal point of Auburn.  In general, the UC provides for uses of regional, as well as 
local, importance.  It is intended to be an area of high intensity use in which a full range of public facilities 
are available.  Approval of proposals/applications may require collaboration between the City and 
developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as parking, additional street 
and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement of the street environment.  
Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. 
 
Occupancy in the UC is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards 
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.02 College Edge Overlay District (CEOD).  This District provides additional regulations for properties 
within Urban Core zoning along the College/Magnolia corridors* for purposes of assuring development 
consistency in meeting building requirements for setback, step back, glazing, cladding materials, signage, 
balconies, awnings, and canopies. 
 
*Parcels fronting on College Street between Thach Avenue and Mitcham Avenue, as well as parcels fronting 
on Magnolia from Wright Street to Gay Street will be included in the CEOD.   
 
304.03. Urban Neighborhood East (UN-E).  This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at 
medium to higher densities to meet the demands exerted by downtown Auburn and Auburn University and 
to promote the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of a wide range of residential, commercial, and 
institutional uses adjacent to the urban core of the City of Auburn. The UN-E District is a development and 
redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character with 
permitted uses to serve a broad range of community needs. 
 
The nature of the UN-E District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District, 
requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by 
the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration 
between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as 
parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement 
of the street environment.  Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. 
 
Occupancy in the UN-E is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards 
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.04. University Neighborhood West (UN-W).  This District is intended to provide for mixed land use 
at high densities to meet the demands exerted by Auburn University, and to accommodate the conversion, 
redevelopment, and growth of residential, commercial, and institutional uses adjacent to the University 
campus and the urban core of the City of Auburn. The UN-W District is a development and redevelopment 
District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character with permitted uses 
which serve a range of student and community needs. 
 
The nature of the UN-W District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District, 
requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by 
the City be undertaken in this District.  Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration 
between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as 



III-3 
 

parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement 
of the street environment.  Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. 
 
Occupancy in the UN-W is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards 
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.05. Urban Neighborhood South (UN-S).  This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at 
medium to higher densities to meet the demands exerted by downtown Auburn and Auburn University and 
to promote the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of residential, commercial, and institutional uses 
adjacent to the urban core of the City of Auburn and the University campus. The UN-S District is a 
development and redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable 
character. Of the three (3) Urban Neighborhood Districts, the permitted uses in this District are geared to the 
community as a whole, but focused on preserving and complimenting the character of the single-family 
residential areas adjacent to this District. 
 
The nature of the UN-S District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District, 
requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by 
the City be undertaken in this District.   Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration 
between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as 
parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement 
of the street environment.  Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged. 
 
Occupancy in the UN-S is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards 
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.06 Neighborhood Conservation District (NC).  The Neighborhood Conservation (NC) District is 
intended to preserve the character of existing neighborhoods and developments under construction at the time 
of adoption of this Ordinance.  It is designed to prevent these neighborhoods and subdivisions from becoming 
nonconforming under the terms of this Ordinance.  This District is also intended to provide for future 
development of land where a NC District is deemed the most appropriate zoning classification, and a 
preliminary or final plat for development of the land has been approved by the Planning Commission.  It is 
also intended to provide for in-filling of existing neighborhoods on vacant lots with single family detached 
dwellings as defined in Section 203 of this Ordinance. 
 
Because there are a number of different lot sizes in the Neighborhood Conservation District, the Zoning Map 
depicts these various areas with the letters “NC” sub-designated by a number.  The number indicates the 
minimum lot size in thousands of square feet.  For example, NC-20 indicates that 20,000 square feet is the 
minimum lot size for the District so designated.   
 
Occupancy in NC zones is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 
 
304.07 Development District Housing (DDH).  The Development District – Housing (DDH) is a District 
that is designed to promote conventional and performance single family housing and/or provide a transition 
between the NC and the CDD. Permitted uses in this District will be limited to conventional residential uses 
of low to moderate densities, outdoor recreation uses, and public service uses.  Performance residential uses 
are permitted conditionally.  At the time of enactment of this Ordinance, the DDH consisted largely of vacant 
or undeveloped land, but it is the intent of this Ordinance that this District have a residential character. 
 
Occupancy in the DDH is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 
 
304.08 Medium Density Residential District (MDRD).  The Medium Density Residential District (MDRD) 
is a District that is designed to promote redevelopment of residential properties to provide more diverse 
housing types at higher densities than the DDH district.  The district is intended to provide a transition 
between the DDH and the UN and CRD districts.  Permitted uses will be limited to performance residential 
housing types, and limited institutional, special residential, and public service uses.   



III-4 
 

Occupancy in the MDRD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by 
standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses 
 
304.09 Neighborhood Redevelopment District (NRD).  The Neighborhood Redevelopment District is 
designed to promote infill and renewal of existing neighborhoods by allowing a variety of residential uses 
while preserving and complimenting the character of the single-family residential areas adjacent to this 
District.  Permitted uses include conventional and most performance residential uses with the intention of 
accommodating moderate densities and providing a transition between CRD-W and NC.   
 
Occupancy in the NRD, west of North Donahue Drive, is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 
 
Occupancy in the NRD, east of North Donahue Drive, is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as 
otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.10 Redevelopment District (RDD).  This District is intended to promote the renewal of those 
transitional areas of the City of Auburn that have undergone extensive changes in land use type and 
density/intensity.  Transition from generally low density residential land use to higher residential densities 
and small-scale commercial, office and institutional use has occurred in a haphazard manner, much of it prior 
to enactment of current zoning regulations.  This District provides regulations that permit redevelopment of 
an urban character.  It provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and 
institutional uses. 
 
The RDD is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and 
public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize transitional neighborhoods, 
thereby reducing the cost of growth in Auburn.  The RDD may not accommodate a substantially larger 
population as a result of redevelopment, but the character, stability and vitality of the District are projected 
to improve immensely.  Like the CDD, this District allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on 
minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses.  This Ordinance, therefore, imposes standards to resolve 
any possible problems and eliminate negative impacts. 
 
Occupancy in the RDD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards 
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.11 Large Lot Residential District (LLRD).  The Large Lot Residential District (LLRD) is a one-acre 
minimum single-family residential zoning district designed with the intent to provide a transition from the 
Rural (R) zoning district (three acre minimum lot size) to a higher intensity zoning district(s).  The LLRD is 
a low density residential district and is more restrictive in terms of the uses permitted than the Rural (R) 
District. 
 
Occupancy in the LLRD is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 
 
304.12 Rural District (R).  This District is intended to protect and preserve areas of Auburn which are 
presently rural or agricultural in character and use. 
 
The standards developed for these areas are designed to permit development compatible with the preservation 
of their rural character and agricultural use, while not permanently foreclosing future development. 
 
304.13 Limited Development District (LDD).  The Limited Development District (LDD) is intended to 
accommodate mainly low to moderate density residential development, supported by commercial uses 
serving the local residents.  Such commercial uses will be limited in range, scale and location; and will be 
subject to design standards intended to promote low-intensity commercial development that is consistent in 
character and appearance with surrounding residential areas.  
 
Occupancy in the LDD is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 
 



III-5 
 

304.14 Comprehensive Development District (CDD).  This District is intended to accommodate most of 
the growth expected in the undeveloped areas of Auburn.  It is to be provided with all public facilities 
(schools, sewers, water, and highways) and will allow most uses by right.  It is intended to provide the zoning 
and capital improvements that attract development.  It consists of the areas where development should 
logically locate as a consequence of planned public facilities and associated capital expenditures.  This 
District provides regulations that permit development of both urban and suburban character.  It provides for 
low- to moderate-density residential development and for necessary commercial and institutional uses. 
 
The CDD is designed to minimize the costs of extending or expanding public services.  It is a planned, logical 
accommodation of growth and is intended to serve areas suitable for development and to avoid unsuitable 
areas.  Uses that are so large as to be of regional importance are not permitted by right, because these uses 
require specialized and different evaluation and have special locational considerations, which may make a 
separate zoning district appropriate.  Major uses, such as a regional shopping center, will be considered as 
conditional uses.  Manufactured home parks, commercial support uses, and road service uses are permitted 
conditionally, and industrial uses are not permitted. 
 
The CDD allows many and varied uses while placing the emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances 
between uses.  Segregation of uses has never provided adequate protection, especially at the boundaries of 
use districts.  This Ordinance anticipates the likelihood – and desirability – of considerable mixing of land 
uses and imposes standards to resolve any possible problems and eliminate the negative impacts of 
juxtaposing unlike land uses. 
 
Occupancy in the CDD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards 
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.15. Corridor Redevelopment District (CRD). This District is intended to promote the renewal of the 
traditional auto-oriented commercial corridors of the City of Auburn. The areas with this designation were 
developed prior to the current zoning regulations and suffer from poor aesthetics and lack of economic 
diversity. This District provides regulations that permit redevelopment of a more urban or mixed-use 
character while protecting the economic viability of the corridor. It provides for intermediate residential 
densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses.   
 
The CRD is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and 
public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize commercial corridors, thereby 
reducing the cost of growth in Auburn. The CRD is not intended to accommodate a substantially larger 
population as a result of redevelopment, but the character, stability and vitality of the District are projected 
to improve. Like the CDD, this District allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing 
or buffering any nuisances between uses. This zone, therefore, imposes standards to alleviate conflicts and 
eliminate negative impacts.   
 
The CRD is divided into four unique sub-districts: Corridor Redevelopment District - Urban (CRD-U), 
Corridor Redevelopment District – East (CRD-E), Corridor Redevelopment District – Suburban (CRD-S), 
and Corridor Redevelopment District – West (CRD-W).  The Urban and East designations promotes more 
compact growth in those areas closer to the Urban Core. The Suburban and West designations promotes 
growth with strong aesthetic and increased design guidance. 
 
Occupancy in the CRD-U, CRD-E and CRD-S is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise 
provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses 
 
Occupancy in the CRD-W, west of North Donahue Drive, is limited to the “Family” as per Section 203. 
  
Occupancy in the CRD-W, east of North Donahue Drive, is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except 
as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses. 
 
304.16 South College Corridor District (SCCD). This District is intended to accommodate commercial, 
entertainment, and services uses that not only serve the local community but also the greater region due to 



III-6 
 

the proximity to the interstate highway.  The district is provided with public facilities (sewer, water, and 
highways) and will allow most commercial uses by right.  This District is not intended to accommodate 
residential or industrial uses.  The District is intended to provide zoning and capital improvement that attract 
development that provides goods and services to a broad market beyond the community.    
 
The SCDD is designed to accommodate growth of commercial uses that require a higher need of access and 
visibility for the regional shopping and hospitality markets.  In addition to the commercial uses that are 
permitted by right, road service uses that are geared toward a retail consumer are permitted, whereas, most 
other road service uses are considered as conditional uses. 
 
Since the SCDD is a primarily commercial use district, there is less need for minimizing impacts and 
nuisances within the district and more emphasis on access and circulation between properties and uses.  
 
304.17. Industrial District (I).  This District is intended to accommodate industrial areas that must be 
segregated, because of negative impacts that cannot be made compatible with other uses through the 
application of performance standards.  The creation of this separate District for industrial use recognizes not 
only nuisances, but also infrastructure and operational incompatibilities between its permitted uses and those 
of other districts.  Accordingly, the standards for this District are designed to accommodate intensive 
industrial uses that generate nuisances, which either cannot be handled by technology or which are nearly 
impossible to police.  Locational criteria for this district focus on transportation, requiring that sites have 
access to a railroad, an airport or a major expressway. 
 
304.18 Planned Development District (PDD). This District is intended to provide an opportunity for a land 
development process with the greatest flexibility available to the developer, consistent with the provisions of 
these regulations, and the provisions included in the master development plan for the subject property. The 
PDD designation may be requested and considered for application only to those properties already zoned 
DDH, MDRD, NRD, CDD, LDD, RDD, CRD, and SCCD. 
 
Approval of a Planned Development District (PDD) shall be based upon the approval of a master 
development plan (Section 505) for the site in question. The approved master development plan shall 
establish the allowable uses, densities, street and building configuration, open space, amenities and buffering. 
Uses shall be selected from those listed conditionally in Table 4-1 following a thorough evaluation of the 
propose location of any PDD. Following the acceptance of the master development plan, the property shall 
receive the PDD zoning designation. 
 
304.19. Conservation Overlay District (COD).  This District is intended to promote the health, safety, and 
general welfare of the public by encouraging the conservation and enhancement of the City’s source of water 
supply and natural resource environment.  The purposes of the district are: 
 

1. To protect water quality in the Lake Ogletree Subwatershed; 
 

2. To permanently preserve unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, 
floodplains, wetlands, streams, and woodlands within the City of Auburn; 

 
3. To offer developers and landowners alternatives to standard development of land; 

 
4. To provide flexibility to allow for creativity in development; 

 
5. To foster less sprawl and more efficient use of land, streets, and utilities; and 

 
6. To permit clustering of buildings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils in 

order to reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility 
easements, necessary for residential and commercial development. 

 
304.20. Holding District (HD).   This District encompasses those land which are owned or operated by 
governmental entities and are exempt from the regulations of this code and those lands which are set aside 



III-7 
 

for public institutional uses and the protection of vital natural resources.  The purpose of the Holding District 
in relation to government-owned lands is to acknowledge their presence within the City Limits while 
recognizing that such areas are not subject to local zoning requirements.  If and when any HD-designated 
property comes under private ownership, the Planning Commission shall assign the appropriate zoning 
designation. 
 
 







 
 

ARTICLE IV.   GENERAL REGULATIONS 
 
Section 400.   Introduction. 
 
The purpose of the regulations contained in this Article is to allow maximum utilization of land while insuring against 
detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public interest.  This insurance is provided 
by separating the incorporated area of the City of Auburn into 20 zoning districts and permitting specified land uses 
within each, provided that a use meets all the additional criteria specified in this Ordinance.    This regulatory approach 
has been termed “performance zoning,” because it permits a use to be developed on a particular parcel only if that use 
meets “performance” standards, which have been enacted to insure against the use causing, or having the potential to 
cause, the negative impacts mentioned above. 
 
The format of the regulations in this Ordinance, and particularly in this Article, differs somewhat from that of 
traditional zoning ordinances, because performance zoning requires that consideration be given to site parcel 
characteristics and the range of impacts that any land use may have. 
 
Section 401.  Use Regulations.  Section 402 through 407 identify the category of use and define the specific uses 
shown in Table 4-1 - Table of Permitted Uses.  Section 408 and Table 4-1 indicate which land uses may locate by 
right, by conditional use, or are not permitted in each zoning district.  In addition, Section 408 provides special 
developments standards for uses that are permitted or conditional permitted in each zoning district. 
   
Section 402.  Use Categories Defined.  The categories of uses utilized by this Ordinance are defined in Sections 403 
through 407.  The uses not enumerated in these sections are not necessarily excluded.  Article IX empowers the 
Planning Director to make interpretations of use. 
 
Section 403.  Agricultural Uses. 
 
403.01 Agriculture.  Agricultural uses include farms (and farm residences); fish or poultry hatcheries; fur-bearing 
animal ranches; orchards; raising of livestock, horses, or poultry; truck farming; and all other agricultural uses.  It does 
not include uses that may be accessory to agriculture, such as retail stores, nor does it include industries or businesses 
that support or are supported by agriculture. 
 
403.02. Forestry.  This use includes commercial logging and pulping operations, clearing or destruction of forested 
or woodland areas, selective cutting or clearing for commercial or other purposes, clearing for agriculture or other 
prospective land uses, and clearing of vegetation in reserved open space or resource protection areas.  This does not 
include authorized clearing in accordance with plans approved pursuant to this Ordinance, removal of sick or dead 
trees, or removal of trees on lots of one (1) acre or less. 
 
Section 404. Residential Uses. 
 
404.01. Conventional residential.  Conventional residential uses consist of all single-family detached dwelling units.  
All conventional residential development approved after enactment of this Ordinance shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 502.01. 
 
404.02. Performance residential.  Performance residential uses consist of all residential developments, including 
manufactured home parks approved after enactment of this Ordinance, except those included within the conventional 
residential use category.  This use category permits the residential builder considerable freedom by allowing varied 
types of dwellings, lot sizes, and design.  It also insures adequate open space in each development. 
 
Section 405. Recreational, Institutional, and Special Residential Uses. 
 
405.01. Outdoor recreational.  Outdoor recreational uses include arboretums; areas for cycling, hiking, and jogging; 
commercial stables; golf courses; nature areas; parks (private); picnic areas; play fields; playgrounds; outdoor 
swimming pools; tennis courts; wildlife sanctuaries; and all other outdoor recreational uses.  Specifically excluded are 
outdoor movie theaters, miniature golf courses, and golf driving ranges.  This use is basically an open-space use.

elderly.  Some uses may be operated for private profit. 
 
Section 406 Commercial Uses. 
 
406.01. Office.  Office uses include governmental offices, business or professional offices, medical offices or clinics, 
and all other office uses. 
 
406.02. Commercial and entertainment.  This use category includes general retail commercial uses, primarily 
occurring indoors and serving a wide range of customers and requiring high-visibility locations. These uses include 
veterinary offices with indoor kennels; auto parts/accessory stores (no repairs); auto detailing; banks and other 
financial institutions (without drive thru windows); blueprint and Photostat stores; bowling alleys; commercial or trade

(including miniature golf), outdoor theaters (or amphitheaters), race tracks  (e.g., auto, dog, go-kart, harness, horse, 
motorcycle), archery ranges, sport arenas, stadiums, and all other commercial recreation uses.  This group includes 
recreational uses that are greater nuisances than conventional outdoor recreational activities, because of their size and 
scale, traffic volumes, noise, light, or physical hazards such as flying objects or use of weapons. 
 
406.05. Recreational rental dwelling uses.  These uses include travel trailer parks, recreational vehicle parks, camps 
or campgrounds with overnight camping or vacation cottages, rental cabins, vacation cottages, and all other

agricultural support uses. 
 
406.08. Nurseries.  This category includes nurseries with or without retail sales or greenhouses.  A nursery is basically 
an open-space use, which generates little traffic and has few nuisances such as late hours or customer or truck noise 
associated with it.  Nurseries are distinguished from more intensive garden center uses. 
 
406.09. Commercial support.  This use category includes uses, which support the City’s retail economy by providing 
merchandise distribution, storage, and repair services.  These uses include beverage distributors; blacksmith shops; 
bulk materials or machinery storage (fully enclosed); large equipment rental/sales/service; contractors’ offices and 
equipment storage yards; dry cleaning and laundry plants serving more than one (1) outlet; fuel, oil, ice, coal, and 
wood sales; furniture cleaning plants; furniture refinishing shops; manufacturing (including the production,

406.10. Neighborhood Shopping Center.  A commercial development site containing one or more commercial 
buildings, together with all required parking, landscaping, buffering, signs, drainage facilities, and other design 
features to accommodate the uses permitted on the site.  The purpose of the neighborhood shopping center is to serve 
the limited commercial needs of nearby residential development.  It is not intended to provide commercial services to 
customers from other areas of the City. 
 
Permitted uses shall include banks; garden supply stores; grocery stores or supermarkets; ice cream stores; laundries 
and/or dry cleaners; light mechanical repairs such as cameras, watches, or tv’s; barber or beauty shops; standard sit-
down restaurants, not fast food establishments; gasoline service stations; and similar retail stores and service 
businesses. 
 
406.11. Community Shopping Center.  A commercial development site, which may include outparcels, 
containing one or more commercial buildings, together with all required parking, landscaping, buffering, signs, 
drainage facilities, and other design features, to accommodate the uses permitted on the site. The purpose of the 
community shopping center is to serve a larger market area than a neighborhood shopping center with certain 
categories of commodities that are less likely found in a regional shopping center, such as garden and building 
supplies. 
 
Permitted uses shall include office; garden supply stores; grocery stores; clothing stores; specialty food stores; dry 
cleaners; electronic repairs such as cameras, watches, or televisions; barber or beauty shops; standard sit-down 
restaurants; and similar retail stores and service businesses. (See Table 4-1).

more square feet of gross floor area on one (1) lot. 
 
Section 407. Industrial Uses. 
 
407.01. Industry.  This use category includes asphalt or concrete mixing plants; bulk material or machinery storage 
(unenclosed); fuel generation plants; grain elevators; meat packing plants or slaughterhouses; resource recovery 
facilities; truck, motor, or rail terminals; dyeing plants; food processing and packing plants; lumber yards; pilot plants; 
scientific (e.g., research, testing, or experimental) laboratories; also, those uses listed above as commercial support, 
any industrial use having 30,000 or more square feet of floor area or having 100 or more employees on any shift, and 
all other industrial uses. 
 

IV-3



 
 

This group contains uses that have severe potential for negative impact on any uses that would locate relatively close 
to them.   This group differs from commercial support uses in that it includes uses that require enclosed structures, 
which are large, tall, and unsightly, such as concrete batching plants.  These uses also have severe potential for 
generation of odor and may involve large amounts of exterior storage; because of their scale, they are likely to have a 
regional impact. 
 
407.02. Extraction and junkyard uses.  This category includes junk, scrap, or salvage yards and all extraction uses.  
These uses create major disruptions to the area’s environment, even when carefully regulated.  Dust, dirt, noise, and 
unsightly conditions can be anticipated.  None of these areas is an acceptable neighbor in an urban environment. 
 
407.03. Airports, Landing Strips and Heliports.  This category includes any facility used for take-off, landing, 
storage, maintenance, and/or repair of aircraft.  It also includes aviation-related activities, such as radar and 
communications facilities, flight schools, and cargo loading and storage areas. (Also see Section 516 Airport Overlay 
District)  
 
Section 408. Uses Permitted by Right, Uses Permitted with Conditional Use Permits, and Uses Not Permitted.  
Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Ordinance, no building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied 
except in the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in this Section.  The general use categories 
specified by Table 4-1 are defined in Sections 403 through 407. 
 
Uses permitted by right or as a conditional use shall be subject, in addition, to use regulations contained in this 
Ordinance, to all performance criteria, and other regulations governing yards, lot size, lot width, building area, 
easements, provisions of off-street parking and loading, and to such other provisions as are specified in other Articles 
herein.  In particular, the laws of the State of Alabama and the regulations of the Lee County Department of Health 
regarding water supply and waste disposal shall be adhered to.  Further, no permits shall be issued until approval is 
obtained from the Lee County Department of Health for water supply and sewage disposal, unless the premises are 
served by public water and/or sewage facilities. 
 
408.01. All permitted uses and uses requiring conditional use approval pursuant to Section 803 are listed in Table 4-
1.  In addition, the table notes uses for which special development standards apply, regardless of whether such uses 
are designated as permitted or conditional.  Special development standards are listed in Section 408.02. 
 
A use listed in Table 4-1 in any district denoted by the letter “P” is a use permitted by right, provided that all other 
requirements of State law and this Ordinance have been met and provided that a zoning certificate has been issued in 
accordance with Article IX.  A use listed in Table 4-1 may be permitted as a conditional use in any district denoted 
by the letter “C”, provided that the requirements of Article VIII have been met.

Section 409.  Zoning District Performance Standards.  Sections 417 and 418 delineate the standards for open space, 
density, impervious surface coverage, and lot area that apply in each zoning district.  The purpose of these performance 
standards is to provide detailed regulations and restrictions by means of minimum criteria, which must be met in order 
to protect neighbors from adverse impacts of proposed land uses and to protect the general health, safety and welfare 
by limiting where uses may be established, insuring that traffic congestion is minimized, controlling the intensity of 
use, and prescribing other such performance criteria as necessary to implement the goals and objectives of this 
Ordinance.  This Ordinance depends on a comprehensive performance evaluation process to insure compatibility 
between neighboring land uses. 
 
Section 410.  Compliance.  All uses and activities shall comply fully with the provisions of the following standards 
as a precondition of development approval. 
 
Section 411.  Performance Standards.  This section contains the basic standards applicable to the districts and uses 
allowed by this Ordinance.  The standards of Tables 4-2 and 4-3 shall apply to each district and use therein.  All 
standards must be met. 
 
Some development standards shown in Tables 4-2 and 4-3, particularly maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and 
impervious surface ratio (ISR), may differ from standards provided in Table 4-4 or elsewhere in this Ordinance; in all 
cases, the strictest standard shall apply. 
 
All tracts of land within a district may be developed to the same density factor.  However, the number of units 
permitted per gross acre will vary from site to site due to differences in the amounts of resource protection land, but 
will in no case exceed the maximum gross density established in Table 4-2. 
 
The floor area ratio is the maximum amount of gross floor area of all floors of a building permitted on the site.  
 
Impervious surface ratios are calculated separately for areas and/or parts of a development site that are separated by a 
public road, railroad, or other feature that affects surface drainage. 
 
The base-zoning district from which they were rezoned shall govern densities, and open space ratios for uses in 
Planned Development Districts.  When a Planned Development District encompasses property with more than one 
original zoning designation, the density, and open space ratio shall be derived from the calculated average figure based 
on the acreage within each original zoning designation.  This average may be applied across the overall site, without 
regard for the original designation. 
 
411.01. Building Setbacks.  
 

A. Minimum Setbacks.  
 

1. Residential Buildings. Residential setbacks are found in Section 502, Residential Use Regulations. 
 

IV-30



 
 

2. Non-Residential Buildings. To calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure 
adequate light, air and privacy to abutting properties, multiply the height of the proposed building 
by the Angle of Light Exposure Factor for the zoning district as shown in Table 4-3.  The product 
of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the property line. If, based on 
this calculation, the setback required is greater than the minimum width of the required bufferyard, 
the setback according to the angle of light exposure factor must be used.  

 
B. Maximum Setbacks. Where lots have double frontage, the maximum setback shall apply to the frontage upon any 
designated corridor (Section 429). For corner properties, the maximum setback shall be measured from the property 
line of both rights-of-way. This setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements.  
 
Recessed portions of any proposed structure, designed for outdoor seating, dining or events shall be allowed under the 
requirements of this section following the review and approval of the Planning Commission. Such recesses shall be 
clearly illustrated on the site plan.

Section 412.   Natural Resource Protection Standards. 

A. All residential and nonresidential development shall be preceded by the identification of any 
environmental or natural feature described in Sections 413 through 416 and shall meet the specified 
standards of environmental protection. 

 
B. Site alterations, regrading, filling and clearing or planting vegetation prior to approval of the 

subdivision plats and/or site plans for development shall be a violation of this Ordinance.  Reference 
in this section to “open space” is intended to mean the term as it is defined by Article II and described 
in Section 417. 

 
Section 413.   Stream Buffer. 
 
413.01. Purpose.   The purpose of this Section is to establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of 
buffers to ensure that the stream and adjacent land will fulfill their natural functions; to reduce land development 
impacts on stream water quality and flows; and to provide for the environmentally sound use of Auburn’s land 
resources.  
 
413.02. Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following words or phrases shall be defined as specified 
below. 
 

A. Perennial stream:  See Article II, Definitions—Stream, Perennial  
 
B. Intermittent stream:  A stream that flows at least six months out of a year but does not flow during 

part or all of the summer and may carry water during or after a rainstorm. 
 
C. Ephemeral stream:  A stream channel or reach of stream channel that carries surface water runoff 

for short durations as a result of precipitation events.  The channel bottom is always above the 
groundwater table. 

 
D. Best Management Practices (BMPs):  Conservation practices or management measures that control 

soil loss and reduce water quality degradation caused by nutrients, animal wastes, toxics, sediment, 
and runoff. 

 
413.03.  Streams Determination.  Perennial and intermittent streams are identified through site inspection by the 
Water Resource Management Department and/or US Geological Survey (USGS) maps. Perennial streams are those 
which are normally depicted on a USGS map with a solid blue line. Intermittent streams are normally depicted on a 
USGS map with a dotted blue line.  Perennial and intermittent streams not identified on the USGS map as described 
herein may be added to a development site plan by the Water Resource Management Department based on the 
determination by a qualified professional that the stream satisfies the USGS definition for said streams. Ephemeral 
streams are streams assessed and determined by the Water Resource Management Department through stream 
delineation done on the development site as reported by a qualified professional.  
 
413.04. Buffer description, width, and permitted uses.  Stream buffers shall be required on each side of all 
perennial and intermittent streams as defined in Section 413.02 and further described in Section 413.03.  Stream 
buffers width shall vary based on the size of the upstream drainage basin.  Table 4.31 specifies the buffer required 
based on the drainage area for a particular stream above the most downstream point on the development being 
considered.  The USGS 7.5 minute 1”:2000’ quadrangle maps, in conjunction with the Soil Survey Maps of Lee 
County and the City of Auburn Geographic Information System (GIS), will serve as tools to delineate the size of 
drainage basins and specify the corresponding buffer width.  
 
The stream buffer is comprised of three zones: Streamside Zone, Managed Use Zone, and Upland Zone.  Buffer zones’ 
function, vegetation and permitted uses vary by zone as described in the Table 4.32.

If an ephemeral stream remains after construction has been completed, and all or a portion of that stream falls within 
the stream buffer of an intermittent or perennial stream, then that ephemeral stream shall be revegetated on both sides 
of the stream in accordance with the targeted vegetation of the corresponding buffer zone.  Appropriate stream bank 
stabilization measures shall be designed if warranted by excessive velocities in the ephemeral stream.  If the ephemeral 
stream remains after construction and falls outside of an intermittent/perennial stream buffer, then that ephemeral 
stream shall be grassed and/or revegetated in accordance with the surrounding vegetation at a width of 25 feet on each 
side of the ephemeral stream.  Ephemeral stream channels and banks shall be stabilized as appropriate for the predicted 
stream velocities.  These measures are performed in order to preserve and protect water quality.

*As deemed necessary and approved by the Water Resource Management Department  
 

413.05. Applicability.   The buffer requirements shall apply to all perennial and intermittent streams defined in 
Section 413.02.  Buffer widths for streams are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water, 
landward from the top of the bank on each side of the stream.  The top of bank is the landward edge of the stream 
channel during high water or bank full conditions at the point where the water leaves the stream channel and begins 
to overflow onto the floodplain.    
 

IV-37



 
 

All properties shall be subject to the buffer width requirements except those properties that are an existing lot of record 
and/or included on an approved preliminary subdivision plat and the lot or lots cannot meet the requirements described 
in this Section. (Effective date 5/02/06 pursuant to Ordinance Number 2389) 
 
413.06. Minimize Intrusion.   Any uses allowed in Table 4.32 shall be designed and constructed to minimize the 
amount of intrusion into the stream buffer and to minimize clearing, grading, erosion, and water quality degradation.  
 
413.07. Land in the Stream Buffer.   Land in stream buffers shall not be used for principal structures.  All new 
platted lots shall be designed to provide sufficient land outside of the stream buffer to accommodate primary structures.  
Stream buffers should be delineated before streets and lots are laid out to minimize buffer intrusion and to assure 
adequate buildable area on each platted lot.     

 
Land within the stream buffer can serve to meet the minimum lot size requirements.  
 
413.08. Setback Requirements.  For all lots within a development requiring a stream buffer, setbacks can be 100% 
within the stream buffer. 
 
413.09. Buffer Impact.  When the application of the buffer zones would result in the loss of buildable area on a lot 
(See Section 203 for definition of “lot”) that was recorded prior to the amendment of this ordinance, modifying the 
width of the buffer zones may be allowed, through an administrative process, as determined by the Water Resource 
Management Department.   
 
Modification and mitigation of the stream buffer width are also available to landowners or developers of newly platted 
lots or subdivisions where there are exceptional situations or physical conditions on the parcel that pose practical 
difficulty to its development and restrict the application of the regulations of this ordinance. There must be proof of 
such circumstances by the landowner.    
 
The landowner or his designated representative proposing any of the impacts shall prepare and submit for approval a 
written request and a site plan showing the extent of the proposed impact and must specify a proposed mitigation 
technique.   Mitigation techniques are included in Section 413.10.    
 
The Water Resource Management Department and other appropriate city staff members shall review and render a 
decision on any buffer encroachment and mitigation technique with regard to the stream buffer requirements.  
Amendment to the stream buffer width may be allowed in accordance with the following criteria: 

 
A. The proposed encroachment and mitigation is in accordance with the purpose and intent of this 

section of the ordinance. 
 
B. The proposed lot and structure conforms to all other zoning and development regulations. 
 
C. Encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable 

buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utility. 
 
D. The landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable written statement justifying 

the need for the buffer impact. 
 
E. The landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable mitigation plan in 

accordance with cited mitigation techniques. 
 
F.   Attention has been given to maintaining natural vegetation and eliminating run-off. 
 

In no case shall the reduced portion of the buffer area be less than the width of the Streamside Zone (25 feet). 
 
 
 

IV-38



 
 

413.10. Stream Buffer Mitigation Techniques.  The following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation 
of buffer impact.   
 

A. Installation of Structural BMPs.  The installation of an on-site structural BMP (i.e. bioretention, 
extended detention/retention, rain gardens, stormwater wetlands, etc.) will allow for stream buffer 
impacts on the specific site.  The structural BMP shall be designed to achieve pollutant (nutrients, 
herbicides, pesticides, sediment and other illicit discharges) removal to the maximum extent 
practicable. The BMP shall remain outside the Streamside Zone.  A detailed BMP design plan must 
be submitted to the Water Resource Management Department for approval along with a long-term 
maintenance plan. 

 
B. Controlled Impervious Surface.  The landowner may commit to and provide a specific site 

development plan that limits the overall site impervious surface ratio equal to or less than 25%. 
 
C. Open Space Development.  The landowner may submit a specific site development plan which 

preserves an undisturbed, vegetative area on-site or near the development site as open space equal 
to 200% of the buffer encroachment area.  The open space preserved must promote water quality 
protection.   

 
D. Stream Restoration:  The landowner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of 

equivalent or greater drainage area the condition of which is determined to be qualified for 
restoration by the Water Resource Management Department on a 1:1 basis in linear feet of stream.  
This restoration shall include stream bank improvements and Streamside and Managed Use Zone 
re-vegetation. 

 
E. Stream Preservation:  The landowner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments within the 

city limits at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple and 
absolute title of the land to the City. 

 
F. Wetland Restoration:  On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (2 acres of wetland 

for each acre of disturbed area), the landowner may provide a combination of the preservation and/or 
restoration of wetlands with protective easements, and the implementation of structural or non-
structural BMPs to achieve pollutant removal to the maximum extent practicable. 

 
G. Greenways:  The landowner may allocate and donate open space within the city limits through fee 

simple to the City of Auburn for preservation and use as common open space. 
 
H. Wider Buffer Widths:  A developer may add additional widths to buffer areas where encroachment 

occurs in other areas on a development site and may obtain an acre for acre credit based on the 
stream buffer zone impacted.  A 2:1 credit could be obtained by determination of the Water Resource 
Management Department in the event additional streamside buffer is set aside for encroachment of 
the managed use and upland stream buffer zones. 

 
I. Other Mitigation Techniques:  Other creative mitigation techniques and plans may be considered 

by the Water Resource Management Department. 
 

413.11. Vegetation Preservation.  The buffer shall provide for the preservation and enhancement of natural 
vegetation or planting.  No live vegetation may be removed from the Streamside and Managed Use Zones for 
preparation of land for uses permitted in Table 4.32 unless approved by the Water Resource Management Department.  
The Water Resource Management Department may grant approval of the removal of exotic vegetation (i.e. privet, 
kudzu, etc.) provided that a vegetation restoration plan is submitted and approved prior to the disturbance of the 
vegetation. The purpose of such plan is to ensure that native vegetation is restored to the Streamside Zone.    
 
Where a developer or lot owner removes live vegetation from the buffer strip, in violation of this section, the Water 
Resource Management Department shall require native vegetation of reasonable diameter in size to be planted so as 

IV-39



 
 

to create a buffer area which is in compliance with this section. A vegetation restoration plan must be submitted and 
approved by the Water Resource Management Department prior to restoration.    
 
413.12. Vegetation Restoration Plan.  A vegetation restoration plan shall include the following information: 

 
A.     Scaled map of lot showing buffer delineation (copy of the survey is acceptable).  
 
B.  Square footage of the actual area disturbed or proposed disturbed area. 
 
C.      Proposed vegetation to be removed from the buffer. 
 
D.     Proposed location, number, and species of plants to be planted in the disturbed area (See list of plant 

species). 
 
E.     Type of ground cover to be placed in the disturbed area (i.e. mulch, pine straw, etc.). 
 
F.  Proposed planting schedule and deadline for completion of restoration activities. 
 

413.13. Buffer Delineation.   The following buffer delineations are required:   
 
A.  Stream boundaries including each buffer zone must be clearly delineated on all grading plans, 

subdivision plats, site plans and any other development plans. 
 
B.     The outside boundaries of the Managed Use Zone of the stream buffer must be clearly marked on-

site by flagging or fencing prior to land disturbing activities.   
 
C.     The outside boundary of the Managed Use Zone must be permanently marked at highway stream 

crossings. 
 
D.     Stream and buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all 

surveys and recorded plats and noted on individual deeds. 
 
E.     Stream buffer requirements must be referenced in homeowners association documents. 
  

413.14. Approved Permits.  Where a landowner or his representative obtain permits from Alabama Department of 
Environmental Management (ADEM) or the U. S. Army Corp of Engineers for proposed impact to the stream or 
stream buffers then these approved mitigation impacts and plans would supersede the applicable requirements of these 
sections of the ordinance.  The regulations that these permits do not affect shall be applicable to the proposed 
development site.  
 
Section 414.  Reclamation of Undeveloped Land.  In the event that construction of a development has not begun in 
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, or has not been completed within one year of initiation, said 
development shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission at its next regular meeting following the expiration of 
the one-year period.  At this meeting, the Planning Commission shall determine whether or not reasonable progress 
toward completion of the development is being made.   Evidence of reasonable progress toward completion may 
include, but shall not be limited to, installation of streets, utility lines and stormwater management facilities; laying 
structural foundations; and completion of any stage of a development approved under a staging plan pursuant to 
Section 802.09(A).  However, the clearing and grubbing of land, in the absence of other improvements, shall not by 
itself constitute evidence of reasonable progress. 
 
Upon a determination that reasonable progress is not being made, the Planning Commission may require the owner of 
the development site to restore the land to the same condition that existed prior to the initiation of the development.  
If such restoration is not feasible, the City Engineer and the Planning Director shall determine and prescribe an 
acceptable condition or degree of reclamation; at the very least, the site shall be sodded or planted in grass, and 
appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent or eliminate soil erosion.  In all cases, restoration activities shall be 
consistent with appropriate Best Management Practices as recommended by the Alabama Forestry Commission, the 

IV-40



 
 

Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and/or the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(NRCS). 
 
Section 415.  Floodplains.  Development within or affecting a floodplain shall be designed and constructed in 
accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 7.5, FEMA Requirements, of the Auburn 
Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 
 
415.01. Permanent open space.  All such areas shall be permanent open space.  No uses or improvements other than 
those permitted herein shall be permitted in any area consisting of floodplain as defined by this Ordinance. 
 
415.02. Permitted uses.  The following uses are permitted within the floodplain as a matter of right: 

 
A. All uses that are permitted in designated open spaces. 
 
B. All uses that are classified as agriculture, nurseries, and outdoor recreation. 
 
C. Piers, bridges and bridge approaches, and picnic shelters, so long as the building permit application 

shows that a licensed engineer has certified that such structures are designed to withstand the forces 
exerted by the 100-year flood event at that location. 

 
Section 416.  Steep Slopes.  Development on steep slopes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the 
regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 4.3.1.1 – Review and Approval of Construction Best 
Management Practices Plans of the Auburn Water Resource Management Design and Construction Manual. 
 
All steep slope areas, as determined by the Water Resource Management Department, shall be identified on the 
Construction Best Management Practices Plan and on any subdivision plats. 
 
Section 417.  Open Space.  The open space requirements of Table 4-2 and this Section shall apply to residential 
development only.  Land that is required by this Ordinance to remain as open space may be used for the recreation, 
agriculture, resource protection, amenity and other purposes specified in this Section.  Open-space land shall be freely 
accessible to all residents of a development, with the exception that agricultural land uses shall be permitted to restrict 
access to that land to those solely engaged in agricultural pursuits.  Open space shall have qualities making it useful 
to residents of the development for either passive or active recreation, and will be developed to serve that purpose; or 
shall serve an important visual role in separating the development from existing public ways or from other existing or 
potential developments; or shall be of value in dividing the development into coherent sub-areas.  Non-recreational 
buildings, except those related to agricultural uses permitted under Section 417.01(C) shall not occupy open-space 
land. 
 
417.01. All developments required by this Ordinance to provide open space shall meet the following requirements. 
 

A. Land designated as open space shall be maintained as open space and may not be separately sold, 
subdivided, or developed, and no structures shall be built on such land, except as provided below.  
All such properties shall be owned and maintained by the developer, owner of the development site, 
homeowners association, or other private entity. 

 
B. An open-space plan shall be submitted as a part of the application for a site plan or subdivision 

approval.  This plan shall designated and indicate the boundaries of all open-space areas required 
by this Ordinance.  The plan shall: 

 
1. Designate areas to be reserved as open space.  The specific design of open-space areas shall 

be sensitive to the physical and design characteristics of the site. 
 
2. Designate the type of open space, as established in this Section that will be provided. 
 
3. Specify the manner in which the open space shall be perpetuated, maintained, and 

administered in accordance with Section 417. 

IV-41



 
 

 
C. The types of open space that may be provided to satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance, together 

with the maintenance required for each type, are as follows: 
 

1. Natural areas are areas of undisturbed vegetation or areas replanted with vegetation after 
construction.  Woodlands and wetlands are specific types of natural areas.  Natural 
watercourses are to be maintained as free flowing and devoid of debris.  Stream channels 
shall be maintained so as not to alter floodplain levels. 

 
2. Agricultural uses specified in Section 403.01. 
 
3. Garden plots are the division of open space into plots for cultivation as gardens. 
 
4. Recreational areas are areas designed for specific, active recreational uses having minimal 

requirements for structures, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, softball fields, and golf 
courses.  An enclosed structure shall be permitted in a recreational area only where it 
directly supports a specific facility and does not require off-street parking.  Recreational 
areas shall be accessible to all residents of the development. 

 
5. Greenways are linear green belts linking residential areas with other open-space areas.  

These greenways are encouraged to designate developed bicycle paths, footpaths, bridle 
paths, fitness trails, or other similar development.  Inter-connecting the greenway system 
between residences and recreational areas in encouraged. 

 
6. Commonly owned lawns consisting of grass with or without trees. 

 
D. Open space shall be appropriately located and large enough to address the open space characteristics 

cited throughout Section 417. 
 

1. No dwelling unit shall be located more than 750 feet from designated open space.  The 
Planning Commission may waive this distance requirement where the developer proposes 
a major recreational facility which will occupy at least 50 percent of the required open 
space for the development.  No more than ten (10) percent of the dwelling units in the 
development may be occupied before this facility is completed and available for use. 

 
Where intervening non-recreational properties separate a dwelling unit from an open space 
area, the Planning Director may require an easement or other means of access for non-
motorized traffic to avoid the need for pedestrians to cross or travel on roads carrying 
vehicular traffic. 

 
2. No parcel of property, or portion thereof, less than 40 feet wide and 7,500 square feet in 

size shall be counted toward the designated open space requirement.   Open space areas 
containing paved or stabilized paths for pedestrians and/or bicycles shall be exempt from 
this requirement if such paths are part of a comprehensive circulation system serving a 
portion of the development. 

 
3. All open space shall be easily visible and freely accessible. 
 
4. The following shall not count toward fulfillment of designated open space requirements: 
 

a) Platted lots for residential use or designated sites for manufactured homes or 
recreational vehicles; 

 
b) Easements for roads, driveways or any other use which is not consistent with the 

purposes of open space as established in this Section; 
 

IV-42



 
 

c) Required bufferyards in subdivisions where such bufferyards are located inside 
residential lots; 

 
d) Parking areas, including planter islands, planter strips, and peninsulas, containing 

required landscaping; 
 
e) Public or private right-of-way; 
 
f) Private roads and driveways; 
 
g) Areas of required spacing between structures, manufactured homes or recreational 

vehicles; 
 
h) Areas which have been cleared of vegetation, excavated, filled, or otherwise 

altered from their natural state unless such alteration is consistent with the 
proposed use of the open space parcel; 

 
i) Any development site (as established by a site plan) containing a clubhouse or a 

non-recreational use including, but not limited to, office, restaurants, gift shops, 
and groundskeeper storage buildings; 

 
j) Any other areas which the Planning Director finds to be inconsistent with the 

intent of this Section. 
 

In addition, no lake, pond, or other permanent water body shall constitute more than 25 percent of 
the total open space required for the development.  No golf course shall constitute more than 60 
percent of the total open space required for the development. 

 
417.02. Preservation of open space.  Open-space areas shall be maintained so that their use and enjoyment as open 
space is not diminished or destroyed.  Where open space is to be provided within a subdivision, such areas shall be 
designated by creating separate parcels within the perimeter of the plat.  These parcels shall be labeled as to their 
intended use, and the plat shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility. 
 
Where open space is provided within a development site, which is the subject of a site plan, and is under different 
ownership than the rest of the site, it shall nevertheless remain part of the development site pursuant to Section 802.11.  
Unless the site plan is modified or terminated in accordance with Section 802.08, the open space areas shall be used 
only as provided in Section 417.  The site plan shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance 
responsibility. 
 
Open-space areas may be owned, preserved, and maintained as required by this Section by any of the following 
mechanisms or combinations thereof: 
 

A. Common ownership of the open space by a homeowner’s association, which assumes full 
responsibility for its maintenance. 

 
B. Deed-restricted private ownership that shall prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision of 

the open-space land and provide the maintenance responsibility.  This arrangement shall be noted 
on the site plan and/or subdivision plat.  Full and proper legal documentation shall be submitted to 
the Planning Director prior to commencement of development activities. 

 
Section 418. Land Use Intensity Classification and Bufferyards and Structure Height.  All land uses that are 
permitted by this Ordinance have been assigned a land use intensity class designation. This classification system 
separates uses on the basis of the type and degree of “nuisance” or negative impact they are likely to impose on land 
uses adjacent to them.  
 

IV-43



 
 

Bufferyards are required to protect one class of use from adverse impacts caused by a use in another class or to 
ameliorate the impact two uses in the same class may have on one another. Bufferyards between two uses in the same 
land use intensity class are not required in this Ordinance for Classes V-XI, because the principal intent is to buffer 
residential uses (found only in Classes I-IV) from nonresidential uses.  However, the Planning Commission may 
require bufferyards between two uses of the same intensity in Classes V-XI or between two uses of different intensity 
where bufferyards are not required by the Ordinance if it appears that problems will result from placing unlike land 
uses side by side without a bufferyard. This regulation benefits both the developer and the adjoining landowner(s), 
because it allows the developer several options from which to choose in developing the property, while insuring each 
neighbor adequate protection regardless of the developer’s choice.  
 
Each land use is listed in one or more use intensity classes. A use must meet all the standards specified for that use in 
Table 4-4. The standards that apply to the highest intensity class for a use shall be the maximum intensity permitted 
for that use. There are standards that set maximum density, impervious surface ratio, floor area, and height. 
 
Steeples, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, and similar ornamental/architectural features may exceed structure height 
by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning district.  Chimneys, ventilators, utility service 
structures, solar panels, flag poles, fire escapes, stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit 
by 12 feet.  Exclusions from structure height are parapet walls, (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or 
railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend.  Exclusions shall not exceed in cross 
sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building.  Exclusions from structure height shall not include 
accessory rooftop structures such as greenhouses, pigeon houses, enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and 
similar structures.  Un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools and jogging tracks 
shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does not exceed the height limit of the respective 
zoning district. 
 
Section 419.  Land Use Intensity Class Standards.  In keeping with the concept that performance should be the 
relevant measure of any land use regulations the following Section classifies uses according to their respective impacts 
(all uses within a use class are considered to have an equal impact on neighboring uses).  A developer may develop at 
an intensity that will minimize nuisances to neighbors or provide a denser bufferyard, if the land is developed at greater 
intensities.  The impacts of greater intensity may include greater impervious surface coverage, with associated 
increased runoff, heat generation, reduced percolation, and open space, increased bulk and height of buildings, 
increased traffic with associated noise and congestion, signs and exterior lighting visible from neighboring property, 
late hours of operation, and other nuisances.  Thus, for example, an office use on any lot may meet the standards of 
Intensity Classes V, VI, VII, VIII, or IX (See Table 4-4).  The range of intensity classes open to a use does not affect 
whether it can locate on its lot, but only how it can develop on that lot.  Performance standards are specified for each 
intensity class; exceeding any single standard in an intensity class moves a use to the next higher intensity class.  In 
the event that a use does not appear in the next higher intensity class, it may not exceed any single criterion in the 
highest intensity class in which it is listed.

stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit by 12 feet.  Exclusions 
from structure height are parapet walls, (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or 
railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend.  Exclusions 
shall not exceed in cross sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building.  
Exclusions from structure height shall not include accessory rooftop structures such as 
greenhouses, pigeon houses, enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and similar 
structures.  Un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools 
and jogging tracks shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does 
not exceed the height limit of the respective zoning district. 

  
 

Section 420.  Bufferyards. 
 
420.01. Purpose of Bufferyards.  The bufferyard is the buffer together with the planting required thereon.  The 
bufferyard requirements of this Ordinance are designed to minimize nuisances between adjacent land uses or between 
a land use and a public road.  The purpose of the buffer is to separate different land uses from each other in order to 
eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or 
parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions.  In 
addition to creating a separation, a buffer determines the building setback for all performance developments, except 
where other setbacks are more restrictive.  A structure in a performance development may require a setback greater 
than the width of the bufferyard, depending on the height of the structure.  This determination shall be made in 
accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 502.03. 
 

IV-47



 
 

The purpose of the planting is to create a visual separation between uses and to enhance the beauty of the City. This 
is accomplished through preservation, protection, and planting of trees, particularly those trees recognized herein as 
canopy and understory trees.    The intent is to derive all the benefits of having trees, shrubs, and other plant materials.  
Among the benefits are: minimizing temperature elevation, reducing noise and wind reduction, reducing stormwater 
runoff and flooding, preventing soil erosion, producing of oxygen, fostering air quality through carbon dioxide 
absorption, providing shelter and food for birds and other wildlife, and softening the visual impact of development 
from public view and adjacent property.  All these benefits contribute to a higher quality of life and enhance the appeal 
and economic value of both residential and business properties of the City.  
 
420.02. Bufferyard Application.  This Ordinance requires that bufferyards be provided between uses in all districts 
except in the Urban Core (UC) District, Urban Neighborhood  (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) District, Neighborhood 
Redevelopment District (NRD), the Industrial (I) District, and the Neighborhood Conservation District.  Bufferyards 
between uses in these zones are not required except in cases where single-family residences occur on land abutting 
development in UC, UN-E, UN-W, UN-S, NRD, or I zoning districts (See Tables 4-5 and 4-7). In addition, property 
located in an Industrial District that has frontage along a designated corridor (See Section 429) must comply with the 
thoroughfare frontage bufferyard requirements (Section 429.06) and a 10-foot wide bufferyard with two (2) canopy 
trees per 100 linear feet is required for all development adjacent to all streets in the Industrial District.  Planting 
materials are specified in Section 426.  Conventional subdivisions shall also be exempt from bufferyard requirements. 
 
Where bufferyards are required between uses and zoning districts, they shall adhere to the buffer width requirements 
shown on Tables 4-5 through 4-7 and the number and types of planting specified in Section 426.  
 
The requirements of this article shall be met for all development sites and developments as defined in Article II. This 
includes vacant, redeveloped or developed sites that require a zoning certificate, that involve changes in land use 
category as defined in Sections 404 through 408, or that are subject to a conditional use permit. Sites that are 
nonconforming as per Article VII of this ordinance and cannot physically meet the requirements of Article IV will be 
subject to Minimum Acceptable Bufferyard requirements of Section 707. 
 
420.03. Location of Bufferyards.  Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending 
to the lot or parcel boundary line.  Bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public 
or private street or right-of-way, but may include easements, at the discretion of the Planning, Water Resource 
Management, and/or Engineering Services Departments. 
 
420.04. Use of Bufferyards.  A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation; it may contain unpaved walkways or 
trails, provided that:  (a) no required plant material is eliminated; (b) the specified width of the bufferyard is 
maintained; and (c) all other regulations of the Ordinance are met.  In no event, however, shall the following be 
permitted in bufferyards:  playing fields, stables, swimming pools, basketball courts, tennis courts, parking spaces or 
merchandise display.  No accessory structures other than signs authorized under Article VI shall be permitted in the 
bufferyards.  No impervious surfaces shall be permitted in a bufferyard except sidewalks, paved driveways or access 
roads that may cross a bufferyard in providing vehicular or pedestrian access to a public street.  In approving such 
access points, the Planning Director shall determine:  (a) that no more are proposed than necessary for the safety and 
convenience of persons entering and leaving the development site; and (b) that the access points have been designed 
so as to minimize the interference with the purposes of the bufferyard. 
 
420.05. Ownership of Bufferyards.  Bufferyards constitute an integral part of a development site, and may not be 
subdivided, sold, dedicated, or otherwise conveyed separately from the development site of which they are a part.  The 
City shall not approve any development plan in which a required bufferyard or any portion of a required bufferyard 
lies on land, which is not part of the development site. 
 
420.06. Responsibility for Bufferyard.  All bufferyards, in their entirety, are the responsibility of the owner(s) of 
the development site on which they are located.  No required bufferyard shall be divided by a boundary between 
different development sites. 
 
Bufferyards within performance subdivisions shall be dedicated to and maintained by a homeowners’ association or 
equivalent organization; such dedication shall be indicated on the final plat prior to recording.  Where a required 
bufferyard is located on common property, said common property shall be owned by the homeowners’ association.  

IV-48



 
 

Where a required bufferyard crosses a privately owned lot, a bufferyard easement of the required width shall be created 
on the lot, said easement being held by the homeowners’ association. 
 
Where required bufferyards are absent, destroyed or in need of maintenance, and a homeowners’ association does not 
exist or is inactive, individual property owners shall be responsible for their respective shares of the bufferyard.  Fines 
assessed under Section 909 may be used by the City to provide the required landscaping.  Bufferyards on common 
property are the joint responsibility of all property owners within the development site, who shall be assessed equal 
shares of any City expenses incurred in restoring such bufferyards. 
 
420.07. Maintenance of Bufferyard Areas.  All buffer areas and plant materials shall be maintained by the owner, 
occupant, tenant, and/or respective agent of each such bufferyard, so that the purpose and effect of the bufferyard is 
not diminished.  The following minimum maintenance activities are required:    
 

A. Replacement of plant materials destroyed by any cause.  In the case any trees or shrubs are destroyed 
by natural causes, plant size, in terms of caliper, height, and gallon, as the original planting must be 
used as a replacement.  If trees are removed or destroyed by the willful act of the property owner, 
occupant, tenant, contractor, and/or respective agent of each, replacement trees of a greater caliper 
than the original planting may be required as determined by the Planning Director.    

 
B. Repair and/or replacement of fences and walls that deteriorate or are damaged by any cause. 
 
C. Restoration of bufferyards that are altered by erosion, construction, or other causes.   
 

Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section shall be deemed a violation of the Ordinance.  Violators will 
be given written notice of the violation and permitted 15 days to correct the violation or submit a landscape plan and 
planting schedule before a citation is issued.  Thereafter, each day shall be considered a separate offense and shall be 
punishable by the maximum fine established by the City Council of Auburn. 
 
The Planning Commission, as part of Conditional Use Approval may select a more restrictive bufferyard than the one 
required in Table 4-5, 4-6, or 4-7. 
 
420.08. Bufferyard Requirements.  Bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the buffer and type 
and quantity of planting materials.  The type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard and structure 
type option are specified in Sections 426 through 428.  A structure type is a wall, fence or berm erected to satisfy 
bufferyard requirements.  The structure type requirements of a bufferyard requiring such may be satisfied by any of 
the options illustrated. The options within any bufferyard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness 
in attenuating the impact of adjoining uses.  Figures 4-2 and 4-3 graphically indicate the structure type options for 
certain types of bufferyards (See Tables 4-5 through 4-7).  Sections 426 and 427 specify species and size of plant 
materials and recommended minimum planting areas.  Plant materials identified in Section 426 shall satisfy the 
requirements of this Ordinance.  Any variation from plantings in Appendix A will be reviewed by the Planning 
Department staff in conjunction with consultation with the City Arborist. 
 
Appropriate landscaping materials for bufferyards include but are not limited to, turf grass, trees, shrubs and seasonal 
color, as well as stone, rocks and mulch.  Where mulch is used, the area must be kept free of weeds. 
 
Section 421.  Determination of Buffer Width.  To determine the width of a buffer required between two (2) adjacent 
parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed: 
 

A. Identify the land use category of the proposed use by referring to Sections 404 through 408. 
 
B. Identify the use category of the land use(s) adjacent to the proposed use by on-site survey. 
 
C. Identify the land use intensity class of all adjoining land uses by referring to Table 4-4.  The City 

will supply this information.

D. Determine the buffer required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by 
referring to Tables 4-5 through 4-7. 

 
E. Determine the street classification of adjacent streets by using Appendix K and Appendix L in the 

Engineering Design and Construction Manual, for use in Table 4-7. 
 
F.   Calculate the required setback based on the building height in accordance with Section 502.03. 

 
Tables 4-5 through 4-7 specify the widths of the buffer required between adjacent existing land uses and streets.  
Buffer width averaging shall be permitted along individual property lines as long as the overall width is maintained.  
The width of the buffer shall not be less than five (5) feet in any location.   
 
The buffer widths cited constitute the total buffer required on the subject property based on the nature of the adjoining 
land use.   
 
The Planning Commission, as part of Conditional Use Approval may select a more appropriate buffer than the one(s) 
required in Table 4-5, 4-6 or 4-7.

Notes: Residential uses shall provide a 15-foot buffer area against a railroad with 16 tree inches per 100 feet.   

1. Residential buffer required along with Structure Type Option 1.    
2. Residential buffer required along with Structure Type Option 2.    
3. Residential buffer required along with Structure Type Option 3.    
4. For projects in the UC, all three (3) UN districts, CRD, SCCD, and I districts, no bufferyard is required if the 

vacant land is in the same zoning district. 

5. Structure Type Option 1 is required for this bufferyard; however, the structure type may be waived in exchange 
for a 20% increase in required understory and shrubs.   

6. A 10-foot bufferyard with two (2) canopy trees per 100 linear feet is required in the Industrial District for all 
development adjacent to all streets.   

 
Section 422.  General Landscaping Requirements.  
 
422.01. Landscaping Requirements.  This Section details the general planting required on a particular development 
site.  A tree inches per acre system shall be used to determine the number and types of trees required on a development 
site.  Table 4-8 specifies the required inches per acre and the required number of shrubs based on the size of the 
development site.  
 
The procedure for calculating the number and types of trees required on a development site is as follows:   

 
A. Determining the Total Tree Inches Required on a Development Site.  To obtain the required number 

and type of planting materials, find the tree inches that correspond with the acreage of the 
development site.  If the acreage of the development site is not a whole number, round the acreage 
to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the total tree inches.  Multiply the tree inches by the 
actual acreage of the development site.  Round all numbers to the nearest whole number.  This 
number is the total inches of trees to be planted on the development site.  If the property abuts a 
conventional residential subdivision, see Section 426.03 for additional tree inches to be added to the 
total inches of trees calculated.   

 
B. Determining the Minimum Number of Canopy and Understory Trees.  Before determining the 

number of canopy and understory trees, a 60:40 ratio (canopy tree inches to understory tree inches) 
shall be applied to the total tree inches.  Once tree inches for each type have been determined, the 
tree inches will be converted into the number of trees to be required on the site. 

 
Canopy trees:  Multiply the total inches of trees by sixty percent (60%) to get the tree inches to be 
devoted to canopy trees.  To convert the tree inches to actual tree count, the inches for canopy trees 
should be divided by 2, which is the minimum caliper for canopy trees.  The quotient is the number 
of canopy trees to be planted on the development site.   

 

IV-51



 
 

Understory Trees:  Take the total tree inches and multiply it by forty percent (40%) to get the tree 
inches to be devoted to understory trees.  To convert the inches to actual tree count, the inches for 
understory trees should be divided by one (1), which is the minimum caliper for understory trees.  
This number is the actual number of understory trees to be planted on the development site. Again, 
this number may be diminished by any applicable tree preservation credits (see Section 427). 
 

 EXAMPLE:   1.5 Acres × 53 inches (tree inches for 2 acres) = 79.5    
 round to 80 inches of trees 
 

80 × 60% = 48 inches 

48 ÷ 2.0 caliper = 24 canopy trees   

80 × 40% = 32 inches 

32 ÷ 1.0 caliper = 32 understory trees 
 

The owner would be required to plant 24 canopy trees and 32 understory trees for a total of 56 trees.  
If the owner decides to plant all canopy trees, he would plant 40 canopy trees and no understory 
trees on the development site. 

   
C. Minimum Standards.  An owner shall be allowed to exceed the minimum number of trees on a 

development site as long as the total required tree inches have been met.  The total tree inches 
required on a development site may be met by planting all canopy trees, but not by planting all 
understory trees.  The maximum number of understory trees shall not exceed forty percent (40%) 
of the total tree inches. 

 
D. Shrubs.  The number of shrubs to be planted on the development site is found on Table 4-8.  The 

number of shrubs is determined by the size of the development site.  If the acreage of the 
development site is not a whole number, round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to 
obtain the number of shrubs per acre. Then multiply the number of shrubs per acre by the actual 
acreage of the development site.  The product is the number of shrubs to be planted on the 
development site. 

 
   Example:  1.5 × 84 (shrubs for 2 acres) = 126 shrubs 
 

E. Landscaping Near Utilities.  Canopy trees shall not be placed within 10 feet of existing or proposed 
underground utilities or on designated utility easements.   

 
422.02. Street Frontage Landscaping Requirements.

Sites with narrow street frontages, in proportion to the total acreage, may be granted a waiver by the Planning Director 
or his designee. The applicant is required to request the waiver in letter form with the submitted landscape plans. 
 
Existing trees located in the street frontage buffer area may receive credits if the trees are protected in accordance with 
Section 429.  The required number of canopy tree inches must be installed, unless the Planning Director, or his or her 
designee, deems that the canopy tree will conflict with utilities.   In such cases, the total number of tree inches may be 
installed using understory trees.   
 
Example:  A street has a linear frontage of 250 feet and requires a 15 foot buffer.  Using the table above, they would 
be required to have at least five (5) 2-inch canopy trees, ten (10) 1-inch understory trees and 25 shrubs.  This would 
equate to 20 tree inches in the bufferyard including 10 canopy and 10 understory tree inches.  Using the tree inch 

IV-52



 
 

method the applicant could use larger trees to reduce number of total trees required.  If the applicant used 4-inch 
canopy trees and 2-inch understory trees he or she could install three (3) canopy trees and five (5) understory trees.  
Furthermore, the applicant could install five (5) 4-inch canopy trees and not be required to install any understory trees.    
 
Should a street master tree plan be implemented for a particular street which the development site fronts; the plantings 
from the street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for that particular frontage. 
 
422.03. Residential Buffer Landscaping Requirements. Additional planting materials shall be added to the 
landscaping requirements for property that abuts a conventional subdivision.  Twenty (20) tree inches per 100 linear 
feet of buffer area shall be added to the inches per acre requirements for any property lines abutting conventional 
residential development.  The 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to determine the number of canopy versus 
understory trees to be planted.  Shrubbery shall be provided between plantings at thirty-five (35) shrubs per 100 feet.   
Planting materials for a residential buffer shall be installed in the buffer area along the property line(s) abutting a 
conventional residential subdivision.   Under no circumstances, can these inches be allocated to other areas on the 
development site. 
 
Development sites which are separated from conventional subdivisions by the railroad right-of-way are exempt from 
this requirement.   
 
422.04. Off-Street Parking Landscaping Requirements.  Wherever a bufferyard required under Section 420.08 
overlaps or coincides with a parking area as defined in this Section, the bufferyard shall take precedence; planting 
required under this Section shall be placed in another location.   
 
Existing canopy, understory, and shrub species may be counted as contributing to the total landscaping required, 
provided they are located within areas addressed by this Section.  The type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy 
the requirements of this Section are specified in Section 426, Plant Materials. 
 
Landscape areas shall be provided in the interior parking area to break the expanse of pavement, provide visual relief 
and minimize temperature elevation from the expanse of asphalt.  Landscape areas shall consist of planter islands, 
planter strips, or peninsula types.  In order to count toward the off-street parking landscape requirements, a planter 
island, planter strip, or peninsula shall have a minimum area of three-hundred four (304) square feet with a minimum 
width of nine (9) feet (hereafter referred to as contributing landscape areas).  Peninsulas may be designed within or 
adjacent to the interior parking area.  The square footage of each planter island, planter strip or peninsula within the 
parking lot must be shown; all contributing landscape areas should be designated on the landscape plan by shading or 
otherwise differentiated from any non-contributing landscape area. Foundation landscaping (landscaping immediately 
adjacent to building) shall not be considered interior parking area landscaping.  Figure 4-1 graphically illustrates the 
area that constitutes the interior parking area and the landscape area types.   
 
The total area provided for off-street parking landscaping shall comply with one of the following options: 
 

Option 1:  One (1) contributing landscape island is required for every sixteen (16) parking spaces in a parking 
lot. 
 
The requirements of this Section shall apply to all off-street parking areas containing twelve (12) or more 
paved parking spaces.   If an existing parking lot is expanded or improved to add twelve (12) or more spaces, 
it shall comply with the off-street parking landscaping requirements of this ordinance within the expanded or 
improved portion. 

 
Option 2:  A minimum of 10% of the interior parking lot shall be landscaped.  The boundary of the interior 
parking area must be shown on the landscape plan. The interior parking lot area is that area inside of the 
parking lot curb or edge of pavement consisting of parking spaces, drive aisles, driveways and immediately 
adjacent areas including all landscape areas. The maximum distance in any direction between islands and 
peninsulas shall be one hundred eighty (180) feet and one hundred twenty (120) feet for planter strips 
measured from the closest landscaped planting area curb edge. 
 

IV-53



 
 

A minimum of one (1) canopy tree shall be required for and must be planted in each contributing landscaped island 
or peninsula regardless of the tree credits received.  Larger contributing landscape areas shall require one (1) additional 
canopy tree for each additional three hundred four (304) square feet of area (i.e. a six hundred eight (608) square foot 
contributing landscape area requires two (2) canopy trees. Any additional landscaped areas, beyond the required 
number, may be planted with understory trees and/or shrubs.  One (1) canopy tree per one-hundred (100) linear feet 
shall be planted in continuous planter strips.  The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs and/or other ground 
covering.  In some instances, these requirements of Section 420.07 may require planting materials in excess of those 
required by Section 422.05.  Existing canopy trees located elsewhere on the development site shall not count as 
contributing to the landscaping requirement for parking areas. 
 
All planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion by the installation of curbing or other wheel stops.  
Parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more than two and a half feet, as long as curbing or 
other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of the landscaped area.   
 
The City of Auburn Planning Department and/or Planning Commission may vary the minimum off-street parking 
landscaping requirements if specific circumstances and/or site conditions warrant such action.  Under no 
circumstances can the landscaped areas be less than ninety (90) square feet, with a minimum width of five (5) feet.   
 
The type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this Section are specified in Section 426, Plant 
Materials. 
 
422.05. Placement of Plants and Structures.  The exact placement of required plants and structure types shall be the 
decision of each user; however, no less than 40% of the ‘general landscape’ material installed on a development site 
must be located in a buffer area when bufferyards are required. Per the International Fire Code, Section 507.05, ‘a 3-
foot clear space shall be maintained around the circumference of fire hydrants.’ There should be no obstruction 
preventing easy coupling of fire hoses or turning on the hydrant. The hydrant should be visible from all approaches. 
Items such as shrubs, brush, posts and fences should not be placed or kept near fire hydrants. Any remaining 
landscaping outside of the required bufferyards and parking landscaping should be placed to soften the facades of 
buildings. The plantings should be placed near the foundations of the buildings, if possible. Additionally, all 
developments must submit a Landscape Plan showing landscaping required by this Ordinance. See Figures 4-2 and 4-
3 for structure types. 
 
422.06. Structures. The Planning Director may waive a structure (Type 1 or 2) requirement on a performance 
residential development in the Redevelopment District (RDD), Comprehensive Development District (CDD) and 
Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) zoning districts. The waiver will be considered where structures are 
required to abut certain outdoor recreational uses, specifically parks, picnic areas, play fields and playground. The 
waiver request must be accompanied by a letter of justification from the applicant. 
 
422.07. Reuse of an Existing Site.  For landscaping requirements for the reuse of an existing building, refer to Section 
707 of this Ordinance.  The landscape requirements will be determined by the adjacent land uses and the location of 
the proposed new use.

Section 423.  Tree Preservation Credit.  In order to encourage the conservation of existing trees and the 
incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, credit will be given for specimen trees and any other trees that 
are successfully preserved and protected in accordance with tree protection methods specified in Section 425. 
 
In order for a tree to qualify for tree credit, it must be identified on the Landscape Plan, protected during land 
disturbance as required in Section 425 and meet the all minimum standards outlined in this Ordinance. 
 
The credit allowed for a freestanding tree shall be the actual Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of the tree saved.  Only 
trees with a DBH measurement of four (4) inches or greater and spaced appropriately for future growth shall be eligible 
for tree credit.  Tree credit shall only be given to trees with main trunks located on the development site.  No tree 
credits shall be applied toward meeting the tree inches allocated to the Street Frontage and Residential Buffers, unless 
the trees are located in these buffer areas.  
 
If during construction, trees that are shown on the Landscape Plan to be preserved are cleared or removed, then 
replacement trees shall be required equal to the total inches of credit given for the trees in accordance with this Section.   
 
Section 424.  Specimen Trees or Stands of Trees. 
 
When making a determination on the identification of specimen trees, the following standards shall be adhered to: 
 

A. Any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: 
 
(1) Large Hardwood Trees: 24-inch DBH or larger, such as oaks, hickories, poplars, etc. 
 
(2) Large Coniferous Trees: 30-inch DBH or larger, such as pines, cedars, etc. 
  
(3) Understory Trees: 4-inch DBH or larger, such as dogwoods, redbuds,  sourwoods, etc. 

 
B. A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum health standards: 

   
(1) A life expectancy of greater than 15 years. 
 
(2) A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than 20% 

radial trunk dieback. 
 
(3) No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
   
(4) No major insect or pathological problem. 

 
C. A tree of a lesser-size than specified in this Section can be considered a specimen tree if it is: 

 
(1) A rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. 
 
(2) Specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a 

landscape project. 
 
(3)  A contiguous grouping of trees, which has been determined to be of high value in the 

opinion of the City.  Determination is based upon the following criteria: 
 
(a) A relatively mature, even-aged stand. 
  
(b) A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature. 
    
(c) A stand of historical significance. 
  
(d)  A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. 

IV-59



 
 

 
In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, 
additional credit will be given for specimen trees which meet the standards outlined in Section 428.  In addition, the 
specimen tree must be successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose.  Credit for any 
specimen tree thus saved shall be twice the normal credit.  

 
Section 425.  Tree Protection. 
 
425.01. Purpose.  The purpose of this section shall be to establish methods of protecting trees and their root systems 
during the land development process. 
 
425.02. Methods of Tree Protection.   Root space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the land 
development process. The root system of trees easily goes beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. Disturbances within 
the critical root zone can directly affect a tree’s chances for survival. To protect the root zone, the following methods 
are suggested: 
 

A. Tree Protection Area – A tree protection area for all trees within the R.O.W., and any trees proposed 
to remain within 25 feet of any proposed grading, clearing, tree removal or construction shall be 
established by physical barriers prior to any land disturbance and maintained until such work is 
completed. All tree protection areas shall be defined by at least a concentric circle centering on the 
trunk with a radius equal in feet to the number of inches of the tree’s diameter at breast height. In 
no cases shall the radius be less than 8 feet. Example: A 12” DBH tree would have a 12’ radius (24’ 
diameter) tree protection area. 

 
B. Protective Barriers – Protective tree fencing shall be installed at the edge of the tree protection area 

prior to any land disturbance. Where feasible, fencing should extend beyond the drip line of the trees 
being protected.  Fencing shall be a minimum of 4 feet in height, consisting of orange polyethylene 
laminar or chain link fabric secured with metal T-posts, or other means approved by the City 
Arborist. 

 
C. Signage – The placement of “Tree Protection” and/or “Keep Out” signage shall be attached to the 

physical barrier at all times. The location and quantity of signage shall be on all sides and convey 
the intent of the tree protection area and barriers. 

 
D. Construction Activity – Construction activities (such as grading, parking, storing equipment or 

materials, trenching, digging, washing or rinsing, etc.) shall not be allowed within the tree protection 
area. Utilities, irrigation lines or any underground fixture shall be routed around the tree protection 
areas. Necessary installation through the tree protection areas shall be accomplished by boring under

428.01. Certified Landscape Plan.  Landscape plans shall be prepared and certified by a Landscape Architect, 
Certified Landscape Professional, Licensed Landscape Designer or Urban Forester with specifications for such plan 
contained therein.  Other licensed professionals (e.g. architects, engineers, etc.) may be authorized by the Planning 
Director to prepare the landscape plans, provided that they demonstrate competence to the satisfaction of the Director.   

 
Where necessary, these plans can be drawn in a conceptual manner to maintain conformance with the Zoning 
Ordinance, while omitting the specifics of placement until final landscape plan approval.  
 
Section 429.  Corridor Overlay Area Regulations.   
 
429.01. Purpose and Scope.  Recognizing the special nature of certain thoroughfares and the direct and indirect 
impacts of the appearance of these roadways and their importance to the local economy, this Section sets forth 
regulations that will help insure that development in these critical areas is visually pleasing and economically viable.  
Henceforth, as parcels are developed or redeveloped along designated corridors, the following bufferyard and 
landscape requirements shall apply. 
 

IV-63



 
 

429.02. Areas of Applicability.  These regulations shall apply to all lots, parcels and tracts that have any frontage 
upon the rights-of-way of any street with a classification of arterial or collector, as designated in Appendix K and 
Appendix L in the Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 
 
Property located in the Rural (R) District and Industrial (I) District are exempt from these regulations, except for the 
bufferyard requirements for Industrial (I) zoned property, as specified in Section 429.06.  In addition, any property 
developed as single-family residential shall be excluded from the requirements of this Section. 

 
429.03. Submission Requirements.  All design elements required by this Section shall be illustrated or described 
within the application materials prepared for the review of staff and the Planning Commission.  Any submission made 
without such requirements shall be deemed incomplete.  Incomplete submissions shall not be considered for inclusion 
on Planning Commission agendas. 
 
429.04. Site Considerations.  All site plans shall be developed so as to preserve, where possible, any existing 
significant vegetation. 
 
429.05. Building Materials and Design Review.  The Planning staff shall review submissions for their general 
compatibility with existing conditions and public improvements according to the process for conditional uses outlined 
in Article VIII. 
 

A. Exterior Building Materials.  All building cladding materials shall be described in the application 
and shown on elevation drawing submitted with the site plan.  Building facades and accessory 
buildings visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic shall consist of natural materials such as wood, 
stone, and manufactured products such as brick, stucco, architecturally decorative concrete block, 
single-lap horizontal cemetitious siding with offsetting vertical joints (maximum seven (7) inch 
exposure), cemetitious simulated cedar shake (exposure on shake), or other such materials as may 
be approved after the review by the Planning Commission.  All structural supports (i.e., columns) 
for vehicular canopies shall be clad in one or more of the same materials as the building facades.  
Exposed metal with architectural metal finishes (i.e., Alucobond or similar type of materials) may 
only be used as architectural trim and accents. 

 
B.  Sign Design.  The location of freestanding signs shall be illustrated on the site plan.  Sign materials 

shall be coordinated with the exterior cladding of the structures. 
 

429.06. Bufferyards and Setbacks.  On all developments, the owner or developer must provide the required setback 
and the required buffer area (see Section 502.02 and Section 422) or minimum buffer areas described below, 
whichever is greater.  In cases where adjoining developments have the same land use intensity classifications, the 
minimum buffer area shall be provided except where developments share common walls or otherwise result in zero-
lot line construction.  The planting materials installed in the buffer areas must meet the specifications referenced 
below.  In those cases where a conditional use is requested for an existing structure, only the required frontage 
bufferyard shall be required.  Developments in the Urban Core (UC) District and the Urban Neighborhood West (UN-
W) District east of North Donahue Drive are exempt from the bufferyard requirements. 
 

A.   Bufferyard Requirements.  When there is no conflict with the required front setback, a 15-foot 
buffer shall be installed along the entire thoroughfare frontage.  The minimum side and rear buffers 
shall be five (5) feet wide.  These buffer areas shall contain planting material in accordance with 
Section 422, General Landscaping Requirements.  The development site is also subject to Sections 
422 through 428.  

 
 For property within an Industrial district, the thoroughfare frontage buffer area shall contain 16 tree 

inches per 100 feet of corridor frontage.  The 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to 
determine the number of canopy versus understory trees to be planted.  Shrubbery shall be provided 
between plantings at twenty (20) shrubs per 100 feet.    

 
The Planning Director may grant waivers to portions of the side and rear buffer areas, in terms of 
square footage and planting materials, to be relocated to other areas on the development site.  The 

IV-64



 
 

applicant shall submit a request along with a landscape plan showing how the proposed buffer areas 
will be relocated.   
 
See Section 422.04 for Off-Street Parking Landscaping requirements. 

 
B. Garages, Car Washes and Service Bays.  All garages, car washes or other service bays shall be 

located at least 40 feet from the front property line and all garage/car wash/service bay openings 
shall be oriented at not less than right angles to the primary public street frontage. 

  
C. Dumpsters and all other refuse collection devices shall be located behind the front plane of the 

primary structure and shall be fully screened from public view. 
 

429.07. Fences and Screening. 
 

A. Lot areas within which repair of vehicles of any type occurs shall be screened from public view.  
Storage areas of vehicles that are visibly damaged or under repair shall be similarly screened. 

 
B. Utility meters, air conditioners and other mechanical units shall not be located on any plane of the 

primary structure that faces a designated corridor and shall be screened from public view.  Screening 
shall be architecturally designed or of a material similar in quality and appearance to other areas of 
the building façade.  For example, a parapet wall may be used to screen rooftop equipment.  
Effective screening should not call attention to itself, but quietly complement the building.   

 
C. No type of wire fabric fencing material shall be used forward of the front plane of the primary 

structure.  Fences in the front yards shall not exceed four (4) feet in height. 
 

429.08. Awnings and Canopies.  Rigid or fixed awnings and canopies must be maintained and kept free from dirt, 
mildew and tears.  Worn, faded or torn awnings and canopies shall be replaced. 
 
Section 430.  Transportation Impact Report.  Transportation impact reports shall be prepared in accordance with 
the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 4.1, Traffic Impact Study Requirements, of the Auburn 
Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 
 
Section 431.  Clear View of Intersection Streets.   Development at intersecting streets shall provide a clear view and 
be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 5.3, 
Intersection Design Elements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 
 
Section 432.  Traffic Management. 
 
432.01. Curb Cuts.  Design and construction of curb cuts shall be in accordance with the regulations, requirements 
and specifications of Section 5.2, Roadway Design Elements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction 
Manual. 
 
432.02. Access for Lots of Record and Redevelopment.  In the interest of public safety, lots of record, as defined 
by this Ordinance, shall be afforded vehicular access at the direction of the City Engineer.  This access may take the 
form of a curb cut directly onto a public right-of-way or may be limited to cross-access via an adjoining lot.  The City 
reserves the right to adopt access plans for thoroughfares in rapidly redeveloping areas in order to facilitate traffic 
management and public safety.  The Planning Commission and City Council shall approve such plans. 
 
432.03. Acceleration/Deceleration Lanes.  Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be provided by the developer at the 
direction of the City Engineer.  Such improvements must be designed and constructed to city, county or state standards.  
Design and construction of deceleration lanes shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.3 Intersection 
Design Elements, of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 
 

IV-65



 
 

432.04. Cross-Access Requirements.  Adjoining lots with frontage upon collector or arterial roads may be required 
to provide cross-access to adjacent properties in the interest of accommodating the curb-cut requirements, public safety 
and facilitating vehicular traffic.  Such access shall be required at the discretion of the City Engineer. 
 
Shared driveways, cross access driveways, connected parking lots, and service drives shall be recorded as an access 
easement and shall constitute a covenant running with the land. Operation and maintenance agreements for these 
facilities should be recorded with the deed.  
 
432.05. Median Cuts.  Center medians are designed and constructed both for traffic safety and aesthetic 
considerations.  Such public improvements are constructed at great expense to the public and, therefore, any alteration 
of the existing or planned roadway medians shall be allowed solely at the discretion of the City Council and only 
where such alteration is in the interest of public safety.  Where such alterations are allowed, the entire cost shall be 
borne by the applicant.  The improvement of other medians or similar traffic control devices in proximity to the 
proposed development may be required in consideration for any allowed median alteration. 
 
432.06. Additional Right-of-way.  Additional right-of-way required by a specific governmental plan for the 
improvement of a given existing or proposed roadway shall, where possible, be divided equally between adjoining 
property owners on both sides of the existing roadway, and shall be dedicated to the City.

ARTICLE V.   DETAILED USE REGULATIONS 
 
Section 500.  Purpose. 
 
The purpose of this Article is to specify the detailed regulations, including bulk, layout, setbacks and lot area, 
which apply to specific land uses.  Standards over and above those imposed by other sections of this 
Ordinance are necessary for certain land uses which, although permitted as of right in certain districts, have 
characteristics that might have negative impacts on nearby uses without these additional regulations.   This 
Article also specifies the regulations applicable to temporary and accessory uses, and it details the off-street 
parking and loading requirements of permitted land uses. 
 
Section 501.  Standards Applicable to Certain Uses.  In addition to compliance with other regulations 
imposed by this Ordinance, the following standards are required of the specific uses enumerated below. 
 
501.01. Renovation, Adaptive Reuse, and Preservation of Structures.  Because there may be value to 
the community in the renovation, reuse and preservation of structures, and because these actions serve the 
public interest, renovation, reuse, and preservation of structures are encouraged in all zoning districts. 
 

A. In addition to a site plan required pursuant to Section 802, each proposed renovation, reuse 
or preservation of an existing structure shall include a floor plan showing the internal use 
of the structure. 

 
B. It is anticipated that the renovation, reuse, and preservation of existing structures will 

involve difficulties with maximum densities in some zoning districts, bufferyard 
requirements and off-street parking.  Where these conditions occur, the Planning Director 
may impose such standards as fencing, screening, and planting as he/she deems appropriate 
to buffer existing adjacent properties.  The Planning Director shall, in the case of higher 
densities and off-street parking, make such recommendations to the Planning Commission 
as he/she deems reasonable in supporting the concepts of renovation, reuse, and 
preservation of structures in the City of Auburn. 

 
501.02. Voluntary Dedication of Property for a Public Purpose.  No existing lot shall be reduced in area 
or dimension below the minimum requirements applicable to such lot under the provisions of this Ordinance, 
except that when a lot is reduced in dimension or total area by 20 percent or less by the voluntary dedication 
by the owner and acceptance of a portion of such lot by the City for a public use, the lot shall be considered 
to contain the dimensions and area it contained prior to such dedication.  However, for purposes of measuring 
compliance with setback requirements of this Code, the dimensions and area of such lot as it exists after the 
voluntary dedication shall apply. 
 
501.03. Limitations on Animals. 
 

A. No person shall keep or maintain in connection with any residential dwelling unit more 
than three (3) dogs aged six (6) months or older, except in the Rural (R) District. 

 
B. The keeping or maintaining of horses, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, fowl or any other 

such animal shall be prohibited within the stock district.  The stock district shall be 
established by the governing body and shown on a map on file in the Planning Department.   

 
Inside and outside of the stock district, the keeping of chickens is allowed, provided: 
 

1. the minimum lot size of the property is 10,000 square feet 
 

2. the principal use of the property is a single-family dwelling 
 

3. the number of chickens does not exceed: 
 

V-1



 
 

a. four (4) on lots 10,000 square feet to 19,999 square feet 
 

b. six (6) on lots 20,000 square feet or greater 
 

4. the chickens are kept in an enclosure or fenced area such as a henhouse, 
chicken coop, chicken tractor, etc. at all times 

 
5. the chicken enclosure or fenced area is a minimum of six (6) square feet per 

chicken 
 

6. the chickens are not kept in any location on the property other than in the 
backyard (the rear yard of the principal structure) 

 
7. the covered enclosure or fenced area is a minimum of 10 feet to any property 

line of an adjacent property and 30 feet from neighboring dwellings, church, 
school, or place of business 

 
8. the enclosures are kept in a clean, dry, odor-free, neat, and sanitary condition 

at all times 
 

9. the chicken owner takes necessary action to reduce the attraction of predators 
and rodents and the potential infestation of insects and parasites 

 
Roosters and the slaughtering of chickens are strictly prohibited inside of the stock district.  
It shall be unlawful to engage in the breeding of chickens or the production of fertilizer for 
commercial purposes.   
 
It is unlawful for the owner of any chicken to allow the animal(s) to be a nuisance to any 
neighbors, including but not limited to: noxious odors from the animals or their enclosure; 
and noise of a loud and persistent and habitual nature.   
 
Prior to construction of the chicken enclosure, a site plan shall be reviewed and approved 
pursuant to Section 804.  
 
Outside the established stock district, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, fowl or any other 
such animal may only be maintained on lots of three (3) acres or more in the Rural (R) 
District. Horses may be maintained only outside of the established stock district on lots of 
two (2) acres or more with a limit of one (1) horse per acre. 

 
C. No person shall breed or maintain any wild animal or reptile that, in the opinion of the 

Environmental Services Director, poses a threat to human safety in Auburn.  Excluded 
from this restriction are zoos, pet shops, animal shelters, medical or scientific facilities, or 
other locations where the showing or maintenance of such animals is a permitted use under 
the provisions of this Ordinance. 

 
501.04. Moving of Buildings.  No structure shall be moved from one development site to another unless 
such structure shall, at the new location, comply with all applicable provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
501.05. Broadcast/TV/Radio Tower Use Regulations. 
 

A. General Regulations and Requirements.  All requirements for site plan approval, as set 
out in Article VIII, shall be met at the time of application for site of new broadcast towers. 

 
B. Safety/Structural Design of Towers.  All broadcast towers must comply with 

requirements as set out in the latest edition of the EIA-222 code “Structural Standards for 
Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures,” as amended, published by the 

V-2



 
 

Electronic Industries Association and all other applicable structural safety standards, 
building and technical codes having jurisdiction, so as not to endanger the health and safety 
of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower due to 
extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. 

 
C. Security.  A chain link fence shall be installed around the perimeter of the compound, with 

a minimum height of eight (8) feet as measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire, if 
applicable).  Such fence is to be located on the perimeter of the compound unless otherwise 
approved as part of the site plan submitted with the application of site plan approval.  Guy 
anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound.  Climbing pegs shall be 
removed from the lower 20 feet of all broadcast towers. 

 
D. Lighting Restrictions.  There shall be no lighting on any tower except when required by 

the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC).  In cases where the FAA or FCC does require a tower to be lighted, any such 
lighting shall be the minimum necessary to comply with federal regulations.  Written 
documentation of any FAA or FCC directives to light a tower differently than provided 
herein must be submitted with the site plan application. 

 
Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity, shall not be directed or 
reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than ten 
(10) feet. 

 
E. Maintenance.  The owner of a broadcast tower shall be responsible for maintaining the 

structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening, buffers, security and other installations 
required by this Section, and by any other applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, 
statutes or conditions of approval imposed by the City of Auburn or its authorized 
representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site. 

 
F. Landscaping.  Broadcast towers constructed in conjunction with a principal structure (i.e. 

radio/TV station) shall comply with all bufferyard and landscape requirements as set out 
in Article IV.  Towers constructed as stand-alone facilities shall, in addition to the 
bufferyard and landscape requirements set out in Article IV, provide the following general 
landscaping directly outside the required fencing: 

 
1. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of eight (8) feet tall when planted, placed a 

minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 20 feet apart. 
 
2. A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches high at planting placed 

in front of the tree line. 
 
3. All plant material shall be xeriscape tolerant. 
 
4. Preservation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fenced area may be 

substituted for the bufferyard and landscape requirements if it screens the 
compound from the view of adjacent development and rights-of-way.  The 
Planning Director shall make determination of appropriate screening. 

 
G. Abandoned Facilities.  Any broadcast facility that ceases to be used for its original 

communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense.  The owner of the 
facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the FCC of the 
intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing to remove 
the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural condition. 

 
In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required 
from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required 

V-3



 
 

to remove its facilities within the one hundred and twenty (120) day period prescribed 
above.  At such time as all providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their facilities 
located thereon, the owner of the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process 
as set forth herein. 

 
H. Area and Dimensional Requirements.  The following area and dimensional regulations 

shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section: 
 

1. Minimum Lot Area:  Determined by setback requirement. 
 
2. Minimum Setbacks:  Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a distance 

equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger parcel, 
setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site). 

 
Maintenance/equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as 
specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed. 

 
3. All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed 

tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence. Guy anchors 
may be fenced separately from the main compound. 

 
4. Bufferyard Requirements:  See Article IV, Section 420.08. 

 
I. Height and Location Restrictions.  In regard to the height and siting of all broadcast 

facilities and their associated structures the following regulations shall be observed: 
 

1. No broadcast tower site boundary shall be located closer than 200 feet to any 
residence. 

 
2. No tower shall be located less than a distance equal to its height, as measured from 

the base of the tower, from any Neighborhood Conservation (NC) zoning 
boundary.  Any new towers so located shall further be restricted to a monopole or 
self-supporting design. 

 
3. No tower shall exceed a height of 300 feet. 

 
4. Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it shall 

be sited behind the front plane of said structure.  Property located in the Rural 
District (R) shall be exempt from this provision. 

 
501.06. Telecommunications Towers. 
 

A. Application and Justification.  All requirements for site plan approval, as set out in 
Article VIII, “Development Approval Process”, shall be met at the time of application for 
siting of new telecommunications towers.  In addition to meeting the general requirements 
for site plan approval, the following information shall be provided when applying for 
approval of a communication tower: 

 
1. A current U.S.G.S. quadrangle map (1:234,000), or equivalent, showing the 

proposed site location and at least a two (2)-mile radius around the site; 
 

2. A scaled elevation diagram of the facility, showing the type, height, finish, 
lighting, site improvements and other such details as necessary to convey an 
image of the facility at the proposed location; 

 

V-4



 
 

3. A study prepared by a radio frequency specialist that includes a mapped coverage 
analysis of the proposed facility and its relationship to the next nearest adjacent 
cell(s) and an inventory and evaluation of existing towers, alternative sites and 
available structural facilities (e.g. buildings, billboards, water towers, or other 
structures that could be used for support in lieu of a new tower) considered within 
a two (2)-mile radius of the proposed location. 

 
4. An inventory of all the provider’s existing telecommunications towers and 

communications antenna sites in Lee County (including those located in 
municipalities within Lee County).  This inventory must include: 

 
a) The location, parcel identification number, and ownership of the 

telecommunications tower. 
 
b) Name of co-locators. 
 
c) Height of tower. 
 
d) Type of tower or nature of other structure where antenna is located. 
 
e) Name of Wireless Communication Service Provider co-location 

coordinator. 
 
f) Copy of Wireless Communication Service Provider’s FCC license. 
 
In the event such inventory has already been provided, each successive 
application must include an update such that said inventory will be completely 
current and accurate. 

 
5. Written documentation justifying the need for a new telecommunications tower 

site to be located on the proposed site.  This documentation must address, at a 
minimum, how the proposed tower is justified in relation to the following points: 

 
a) A list, description and map of the potential co-location, nonresidential 

use or alternative location sites that are located within the geographic 
service area of the proposed site; 

 
b) Documentation that requests for co-location have been made at least 30 

days prior to the filing of application for site plan approval. 
 

c) A detailed explanation of why each such site was not technologically, 
legally or economically feasible, or why such efforts were otherwise 
unsuccessful; 

 
d) An analysis of how and why the proposed site is essential to meet service 

demands for the geographic service area and the countywide network; 
 

6. Certification that the proposed telecommunications tower is structurally and 
technically designed and capable, and will be so constructed, to meet the co-
location requirements set forth in this Section.  Immediately upon completion of 
construction, as-built certifications of same shall be submitted as well. 

 
B. Co-location Requirements.  All towers constructed subsequent to the adoption of this 

Section, and their associated compounds, shall be designed and built to accommodate 
additional wireless communication service providers based on the height of the tower as 
follows: 

V-5



 
 

 
1. Towers 80 to 159 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of two (2) 

providers. 
 
2. Towers 160 to 209 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of three (3) 

providers. 
 
3. Towers of 210 to 300 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of four (4) 

providers. 
 

Carriers wishing to co-locate on an existing tower may receive administrative approval of 
their request. 

 
C. Maximum Utilization of Existing Sites.  No new telecommunications tower shall be 

constructed if space is structurally, technically, and economically available for the 
proposed telecommunications antenna(s) and related facilities on an existing tower; or on 
an alternative site (e.g. building or other structure), where such alternative location would 
cover the required service area without creating undue signal interference. 

 
D. Safety/Structural Design of Towers.  All telecommunication towers must comply with 

requirements as set out in the latest edition of the TIA-222 code (revised July 20, 2005) 
“Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures,” as 
amended, published by the Electronic Industries Association, and all other applicable 
structural safety standards, building and technical codes having jurisdiction, so as not to 
endanger the health and safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural 
failure of the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other Acts of God. 

 
E. Security.  A chain link steel fence shall be installed around the perimeter of the compound, 

with a minimum height of eight (8) feet as measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire, 
if applicable).  Such fence is to be located on the perimeter of the compound unless 
otherwise approved as part of the site plan submitted with the application for site plan 
approval.  (Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound).  Climbing 
pegs shall be removed from the lower 20 feet of all communication towers. 

 
F. Lighting Restrictions.  There shall be no lighting on any tower except when required by 

the FAA or FCC.  In cases where the FAA or FCC does require a tower to be lighted, any 
such lighting shall be the minimum necessary to comply with federal regulations.  Written 
documentation of any FAA or FCC directives to light a tower differently than provided 
herein must be submitted with the site plan application. 

 
Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity shall not be directed or 
reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than ten 
(10) feet. 

 
G. Maintenance.  The owner of a telecommunications tower shall be responsible for 

maintaining the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening, buffers, security and 
other installations required by this Section, and by any other applicable codes, ordinances, 
regulations, statutes or conditions of approval imposed by the City of Auburn or its 
authorized representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site. 

 
H. Landscaping.  In addition to the required bufferyards as determined by standards set out 

in Article IV, Section 420.08, the following general landscaping shall be provided directly 
outside the required fencing: 

 
1. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of eight (8) feet tall when planted, placed a 

minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 20 feet apart. 

V-6



 
 

 
2. A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches high at planting placed 

in front of the tree line. 
 

3. All plant materials shall be xeriscape tolerant. 
 

4. Preservation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fenced area may be 
substituted for the bufferyard and landscape requirements if it screens the 
compound from the view of adjacent development and rights-of-way.  The 
Planning Director shall make determination of appropriate screening. 

 
I. Abandoned Facilities.  Any wireless telecommunications facility that ceases to be used 

for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense.  The 
owner of the facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the 
FCC of the intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing 
to remove the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural 
condition. 

 
In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required 
from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required 
to remove its facilities within the 120-day period prescribed above.  At such time as all 
providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their facilities located thereon, the 
owner of the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process as set forth herein. 

 
J. Area and Dimensional Requirements.  The following area and dimensional regulations 

shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section: 
 

1. Minimum Lot Area:  Determined by setback requirement. 
 
2. Minimum Setbacks:  Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a distance 

equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger parcel, 
setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site). 

 
Maintenance/Equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as 
specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed. 

 
3. All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed 

tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence.  Guy anchors 
may be fenced separately from the main compound. 

 
4. Bufferyard Requirements:  See Article IV, Sections 420.08. 

 
K. Height and Location Restrictions.  In regard to the height and siting of all 

telecommunications facilities and their associated structures, the following regulations 
shall be observed: 

 
1. No telecommunications tower site boundary shall be located closer than 200 feet 

to any residence. 
 

2. No tower shall be located less than a distance equal to its height, as measured from 
the base of the tower, from any Neighborhood Conservation (NC) zoning 
boundary.  Any new tower so located shall further be restricted to a monopole or 
self-supporting design. 

 
3. No tower shall exceed a height of 300 feet. 

 

V-7



 
 

4. Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it shall 
be sited behind the front plane of said structure.  This provision shall not apply in 
the Rural (R) District. 

 
L. Pre-Existing Towers.  Any telecommunications tower or telecommunications antenna for 

which a permit has been properly issued shall hereafter be considered a non-conforming 
use subject to the provisions of Article VII of this Ordinance.  The purpose and intent of 
this Section is to minimize the proliferation of new towers and promote the co-location of 
new antennas onto existing towers.  Any communications antenna locating on a pre-
existing properly permitted telecommunications tower subsequent to adoption of this 
Section shall be exempt from the restrictions of Article IV of this Ordinance when the 
provisions below are met: 

 
1. If structural strengthening is necessary to accommodate co-location, the tower 

type shall remain the same as previously permitted. 
 

2. There will be no increase in the total height or type of lighting of the facility, 
including the tower, antennas and all other associated facilities. 

 
3. All setback and buffer requirements applicable to the existing tower, at the time 

its permit was issued will continue to be applicable to such tower. 
 

The Planning Department shall permit such facilities through administrative review and 
approval. 

 
M. Exemptions.  The following wireless communications facilities shall be exempt from the 

requirements of this Section: 
 

1. Amateur radio antennas and receive-only antennas not more than 60 feet in height, 
and satellite earth station antennas two (2) meters or less in diameter, shall be 
exempt as provided for in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 when no 
supportive tower is to be constructed. 

 
2. Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by public 

emergency agencies or government agencies. 
 

3. Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by private 
entities, or for internal communications by public utilities, provided such facilities 
do not exceed a total of 60 feet in height whether mounted to a structure or ground 
mounted. 

 
The Planning Director shall make determination of exemption of any such facilities 
exceeding the foregoing dimensions. 

 
Section 502.  Residential Use Regulations.  This Section specifies the minimum lot dimensions and other 
requirements for each type of residential unit permitted by this Ordinance, except in the Neighborhood 
Conservation District (NC).  
 
The following structures shall be allowed to project into or be constructed in any minimum required yard as 
follows: awnings and canopies, roof overhangs and balconies not to exceed three (3) feet; bay windows, not 
to exceed two (2) feet; clotheslines; driveways and their curbs, fences, walls, and hedges may be constructed 
in minimum yard areas, provided that their installation does not violate any other provision of this Ordinance. 
Uncovered decks of no more than 30 inches in height may extend to within five (5) feet of the property line. 
Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to allow encroachment of any feature into a required 
bufferyard. 
 

V-8



 
 

 
When a lot size exceeds the minimum permitted area, all other standards applicable to the minimum lot area 
shall nevertheless apply.  The figures specified in the tables of this Section are expressed in terms of square 
feet, feet, or a ratio, whichever applies. 
 
502.01. Conventional subdivisions.  A conventional subdivision consists of single-family dwellings on 
individual lots and requires no public or community open space.  
 
A conventional subdivision is characterized by division of the entire subject parcel into lots.  Table 5-1, Lot 
Area, Setbacks and Maximum Impervious Surface and Parking Requirements for Conventional Subdivisions, 
specifies the minimum standards for conventional single-family subdivision lots of various sizes.  Table 5-2 
provides development standards for conventional subdivisions in the Neighborhood Conservation (NC) 
District.

1This column indicates the regulations applicable to the Neighborhood Conservation (NC) District, which as different standards according to 
the minimum lot size of the particular district.  The minimum lot size of a Neighborhood Conservation (NC) District varies and is a function 
of the character of that district as of the date of enactment of this Ordinance.  The subscript following the "NC" in each row of this tables 
designates the minimum lot size in thousands of square feet (as the district is designated on the official zoning map).  Thus, the minimum lot 
area in a district designated NC-80 is 80,000 square feet. 

2For lots fronting on a curve, see the City of Auburn Subdivision Regulations, Article IV, Section (E)(2).  Width at road frontage shall be

502.02. Performance Residential Developments.  The purpose of a performance residential development 
is to provide innovative development types that make efficient use of land and public facilities, and/or to 
protect natural features addressed in Sections 412-417. 
 
Performance residential developments may contain one or more of the housing types that are specified in this 
subsection subject to the overall density standards established in Table 4-2.  For purposes of calculating 
density, the development site shall include all platted lots, together with road, drainage facilities, utility sites 
and any other common property within the perimeter of the subdivision plat, regardless of whether or not 
such facilities will ultimately be dedicated to the City.  Such developments shall contain the minimum amount 
of open space specified in Table 4-2.  Prior to approving the final plat, the Planning Director shall verify that 
all parcels or tracts not intended for use as residential lots are clearly delineated on the plat as to size and 
dimension.  The purpose, ownership, and responsibility for maintenance for each parcel or tract shall be noted 
on the plat. 
 
Unless specifically accepted by the City Council, the City of Auburn shall not be responsible for maintenance 
and/or repair of any common facility or properties. 
 
Performance residential developments shall be self-contained in terms of meeting the requirements of this 
Ordinance.  In addition to other relevant requirements, site plans and subdivision plats shall designate and 
establish maintenance responsibility for all required recreation, resource protection, and other open space and 
common properties within the development site.  Where a performance residential development is to be built 
in stages or will contain a mixture of land uses, a Master Development Plan shall be required.

Sufficient open space shall be provided to protect any of the resource types specified in 
Sections 412-417. 
 
Note:  Manufactured Home Subdivisions developed under performance residential 
standards shall be subject to the same criteria as that set out above for single-family 
detached house development. 

 
   

 
  

V-12



 
 

B. Zero Lot Line.  Under this development concept, each residential lot contains a dwelling 
unit placed along one side lot line in order to maximize usable open area within the lot.  All 
zero lot line subdivision plats shall show driveways, walkways, patio slabs, and building 
envelopes for all structures.  No windows, doors, air conditioning units or other openings 
or projections of any kind shall be permitted where the structure meets the side lot line.  
However, a window may face the zero side yard if it is recessed at least five (5) feet from 
the property line. 

 
For each unit constructed along a side lot line, an easement of five (5) feet in width shall 
be created on the adjoining property.  The purpose of this easement is to permit 
maintenance and repair of the portion of the structure bordering the zero side yard.  All 
maintenance easements shall be shown on the final plat, along with an indication of the lot 
to which each easement is assigned.  No fence, patio, deck, or structure of any kind shall 
be placed within a maintenance easement. 

 
Zero lot-line units shall not take access from an arterial road. 

 
In addition to the bufferyard requirements of Sections 420 through 428, zero lot-line 
subdivisions shall also meet the following development criteria:

C.   Town House.  This development type consists of a subdivision, platted according to the 
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations, which is designed for town house dwelling 
units as defined in Article II.  Each town house unit shares a common wall with another 
such unit on one or both sides, has individual entrances (not used by other units) in the 
front and rear, and is place on its own lot within the subdivision.  All town house structures 
shall contain three (3) or more dwelling units.  Such units may have multiple stories or 
combinations of one- and two-story sections; however, in no case shall one unit be above 
or behind another.  Front, side and/or rear yards may be enclosed by a masonry wall not 
exceeding six (6) feet in height provided that such walls do not prevent a clear view of 
intersecting streets. 

 
In addition to meeting all other requirements of the Subdivision Regulations, plats for town 
house development shall show driveways, walkways, patio slabs, and building envelopes 
for all structures.  No more than ten (10) town house units shall be permitted in any 
structure. 

 
Town house lot shall not take direct access from an arterial road.

D.   Twin House.  This development type consists of a subdivision, platted according to the 
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations, which is designed for twin house dwelling 
units as defined in Article II.  Each twin house unit shares a common wall with another 
such unit on one side, has individual entrances (not used by other units) in the front and 
rear, and is placed on its own lot within the subdivision.  Twin house structures shall consist

1For purposes of site plan review, it shall be assumed that impervious surfaces cover 60 percent 
of each designated manufactured home site unless the site plan specifies a lesser amount. 

 
1. Landscaping and Yards: 

 
a) All manufactured home parks shall be landscaped with five (5) canopy 

trees, five (5) understory trees, and 25 shrubs per 300 linear feet of buffer 
area or 10 dwelling units and separated from all other land uses by a 
twenty (20) foot wide residential buffer pursuant to Section 422.03. 

 
b) Manufactured homes and structures shall be placed at least 20 feet from 

the pavement edge of private park roads. 
 
c) Manufactured homes and freestanding structures serving as common 

facilities shall be at least 30 feet apart.  No carport or other attached 
structure may be installed on a manufactured home less than 20 feet from 
another manufactured home or attached structure.  This distance shall be 
measured between the closest points of the units or structures. 

 
d) Storage sheds or other freestanding accessory structures shall be 

prohibited in required bufferyards and open space areas.  Any such 
structure shall be at least ten (10) feet from any other structure.

that exceed 30 feet in length.  The storage area shall be for the use of 
park residents only, and shall be fenced and landscaped.  Storage of these 
units shall be prohibited on individual manufactured home sites or on 
park roads. 

 
3. Other regulations: 

 
a) Ownership.  Manufactured home parks may not be platted or otherwise 

divided by fee simple ownership; however, the sale of interests or 
memberships on a condominium basis is permitted.  All facilities, 
including roads, shall be privately owned or owned in common by 
residents of the park, and shall not occupy parcels of land which are 
deeded separately from the common facilities within any manufactured 
home park. 

 
b) Access and Internal Circulation.  Internal park roads and driveways shall 

be paved, and shall be owned and maintained by the developer or 
property owner of the park.  For each manufactured home site, two (2) 
paved off-street parking spaces of ten (10) feet by 20 feet each shall be 
provided.  No individual manufactured home site shall have direct access 
to a public right-of-way. 

 
c) Site Plan.  No structures or facilities shall be installed or constructed until 

a site plan meeting the requirements of Section 802 of this Ordinance has 
been submitted to and approved by the City of Auburn.  All 
improvements, regardless of timing or project phasing, shall be 
substantially consistent with the approved site plan.  Where an existing 
manufactured home park has no site plan, such a plan shall be prepared 
and submitted to the City prior to the addition, improvement, 
rearrangement or replacement of park facilities or manufactured homes. 

 
d) Occupancy.  No manufactured home shall be installed, stored, or 

otherwise located within a manufactured home park development site, 
nor shall residential utility service be authorized, until the park has 
received a Certificate of Occupancy from the Codes Enforcement 
Division. 

 
Section 503 Building Setbacks. 
 

A. Minimum Setbacks.  To calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure 
adequate light, air, and privacy to abutting properties, multiply the height of the proposed 
building by the Angle of Light Exposure Factor for the zoning district as shown below: 

 
District 

Angle of Light 
Exposure Factor 

  
DDH 1.0 
NRD 0.75 
MDRD 0.5 
RDD 1.0 
LLRD 1.0 
R 1.0 
LDD 1.0 
CDD 1.0 
SCCD 1.0 

V-22



 
 

  

The product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the 
property line.  If, based on this calculation, the setback required is greater than the 
minimum width of the required bufferyard, the setback according to the angle of light 
exposure factor must be used.  Also, note that the setback required by this calculation may 
further restrict the setback requirements of Section 502.02 for performance housing types.  
In all cases the most restrictive setback requirement must be used.  This section shall not 
apply to conventional subdivisions in any district. 
 

B. Exceptions. The following structures shall be allowed to project into or be constructed in 
any minimum required yard as follows: awnings and canopies, roof overhangs and 
balconies not to exceed three (3) feet; bay windows, not to exceed two (2) feet; clotheslines; 
driveways and their curbs, fences, walls, and hedges may be constructed in minimum yard 
areas, provided that their installation does not violate any other provision of this Ordinance. 
Uncovered decks of no more than 30 inches in height may extend to within five (5) feet of 
the property line. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to allow 
encroachment of any feature into a required bufferyard. 

 
C. Maximum Setbacks.  Where lots have double frontage, the maximum setback shall apply 

to the frontage upon any designated corridor (Section 429).  For corner properties, the 
maximum setback shall be measured from the property line of both rights-of-way.  This 
setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements. 
Recessed portions of any proposed structure, designed for outdoor seating, dining or events 
shall be allowed under the requirements of this section following the review and approval 
of the Planning Commission.  Such recesses shall be clearly illustrated on the site plan.

shall be increased by three (3) feet for each story of each structure in excess of two stories. 
 

E. Building Setback and Height for the Urban Core (UC), College Edge Overlay District 
(CEOD), and Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts.  
 
For building setbacks in the Urban Core (UC) district see Section 507. 
 
For building setbacks in the College Edge Overlay District (CEOD) see Section 508. 
 
For building setbacks in the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) districts see 
Section 509. 
 

Section 504.   Planned Developments.  A planned development is intended to encourage flexibility in siting, 
mixtures of housing types and land uses, open space, and the preservation of significant natural features.  The 
goal is a development in which buildings, land use, transportation facilities, utility systems and open spaces 
are integrated through an overall design. A planned development shall be permitted in a Planned 
Development District (PDD) overlay district.  The PDD overlay district is an additional zoning requirement 
that is placed on a geographic area already zoned.  The PDD designation can be requested and considered 
only for properties already zoned as DDH, MDRD, CDD, LDD, NRD, RDD, CRD, and SCCD. 
 

V-23



 
 

Property receiving a PDD designation shall be subject to the provisions of both the base zoning district and 
the PDD.  The base zone, which is the underlying zone, shall regulate the lot area, setback, bulk regulations, 
parking, the maximum FAR and ISR, maximum gross density and the minimum open space ratio for 
performance residential uses; and the minimum site area and lot width for nonresidential uses.  The PDD 
overlay zone shall regulate the permitted and conditional uses allowed; the mixed-use development 
components; and the maximum percentage of allowable dwelling units in a mixed commercial/residential 
development.   
 
Where provisions of the PDD and the zoning districts are in conflict, the provisions of the PDD shall govern.   
 
504.01. Minimum Size and Ownership.   A planned development shall consist of a minimum of ten (10) 
acres.  At the time of the application for PDD zoning, the entire tract of land for which rezoning is requested 
shall be under unified control of a single individual, partnership or corporation. 
 
504.02. Uses Permitted on Approval.  All conditional uses set forth on Table 4-1 for PDD are allowed if 
approved by City Council.   Mixed-use developments are allowed within the Planned Development District 
(PDD) and according to the following requirements: 
  

A. The maximum gross density, minimum open space ratio and maximum density factor for 
all planned developments shall be the same as the base district from which the site was 
rezoned.  The allowable figures for the Limited Development District (LDD) shall serve as 
the minimum standard in all cases. 

 
B. A mixed-use development in the Planned Development District may consist of: 1) any 

commercial uses permitted in this district as set forth in Sections 402 and 408 of this 
Ordinance, and 2) one or more dwelling units on the same development as the commercial 
uses. 

 
A Master Development Plan shall be required in connection with any request for PDD zoning.   
 
504.03. Connection between uses and adjoining development.   Connection between mixed use and 
residential areas is required in order to provide cohesiveness in the overall development site.  Cohesiveness 
shall be provided through connectedness of land uses, streets, utilities, pedestrian and bicycle paths, 
greenways, and signage.  The design of any planned development or mixed-use development should reflect 
effort by the developer to plan land uses so as to blend harmoniously not only within the development site, 
but with adjacent land uses to ensure compatibility, cohesiveness, and connectivity. 
 
504.04. Changes to zoning ordinance.  No amendments to this zoning ordinance relative to planned 
development shall be effective to any PDD approval issued prior to such amendment, it being intended that 
the PDD shall continue to be developed in accordance with the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of such 
prior approval.  (Amendments dated 5/02/06 pursuant to Ordinance Number 2389) 
 
504.05. Development Incentives.  Development incentives shall be provided to developers of qualified 
planned development upon the written request.  Incentive is the granting by the approving authority of 
additional development capacity in exchange for a public benefit or amenity.  Providing incentives is not just 
beneficial for the developer, but to adjacent development, and the public.  The need for incentives will vary 
for different planned developments. Therefore, the allocation of incentives shall be determined on a case-by-
case basis.  Incentives may include any of the following:  
 

Incentive 

Density Bonus:  10% increase in base zone density. 

Density Bonus:  20% increase in base zone density* 

V-24



 
 

Floor Area Ratio: An increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) for individual performance single-family residential 
lots not to exceed 20% above the allowable FAR. 

Reduced Setbacks:  Reduction in front and side setback requirements for single-family residential uses as long 
as the minimum front yard setback is at least ten (10) feet and no porch encroaches into this 10-foot front 
setback.  The side yards shall not be less than five feet.     

The request for setback incentives shall not result in encroachment of any structures into a required landscaped 
bufferyard, stream buffer or other environmentally sensitive areas. 

Reduction in Minimum Lot Width:  A reduction up to 20% in the minimum lot width for single-family detached 
and zero lot line residential lots.  No reduction shall be allowed for lots located in a cul-de-sac or along the 
curvature of a street. 

Master Signage Plan Approval:  To expedite the sign permitting process, a Master Sign Plan can be submitted 
depicting all proposed signage, in accordance with Section 606, for the planned development.  Flexibility may 
be granted by the Planning Director in the number, size, location, and height of the signs.  Once approved, no 
signs shall be erected on the site, except as shown on the approved Master Signage Plan.  A Master Development 
Plan may be amended by filing a new plan. 

Accelerated Preliminary Plat Approval Process:  To expedite the approval process, preliminary plats for 
residential developments shall be approved administratively by staff.  This incentive shall be contingent upon 
findings by the staff that the preliminary plats are consistent with the approved Master Development Plan.   

A public hearing for the preliminary plat will be held in conjunction with the public hearing for the PDD/Master 
Development Plan approval process.  In this case, the Master Development Plan will be referred to as the 
Preliminary Master Development Plan.  A Preliminary Master Development Plan shall be required to contain 
more detailed information relative to the lot size and lot width of each residential lot. 

Increase in ISR: An increase in the impervious surface ratio (ISR) for residential uses not to exceed 20% above 
the allowable ISR. This incentive is not applicable to developments in the Lake Ogletree/Martin-Marietta 
watersheds and any areas zoned for conservation subdivisions. 

         *The exchange for this incentive is predetermined.  See asterisk* under Exchange. 
 

Exchange 

Open Space Improvements: Improvements to greenway/open space such as pedestrian paths, bike trails, and 
street lighting along pedestrian paths and bike trails.  Improvements must be approved by the Planning Director 
and the Parks and Recreation Director.   

*Housing for the Elderly and/or Low and Moderate Income: Provision of housing qualifying as elderly housing 
or low- and moderate-income families in accordance with federal guidelines (See Economic Development). 

Vegetated Buffer Along the Perimeter: A 20-foot wide undisturbed natural or landscaped buffer along the 
perimeter of the development site. An undisturbed natural buffer/open space is an unimproved area that has 
retained its natural character of trees, shrubs and ground covering.  A landscaped buffer must meet the standards 
for residential buffer landscaping requirements as cited in Section 422.03 of this Ordinance. 

Increased Open Space:  A 25% increase in open space beyond the minimum required open space for the 
development site (required acreage of open space X 25%).  The additional open space shall be comprised of 
undisturbed natural open space.  Vegetated buffers along the perimeter cannot count toward the increased open 
space requirement.  In addition, stream buffers, utility easements and other easements required by the City of 
Auburn shall not count as open space under this incentive.  Moreover, this exchange can be offered twice for 
two incentives.  For example, a developer can offer a 50% increase over the minimum required open space for 
his development site in exchange for two incentives of his choice.    

V-25



 
 

Park and Recreation Areas:  A minimum of five acres of useable park space to be developed and maintained 
primarily for both active and passive recreational pursuits, including but not limited to tot-lots, playgrounds, 
neighborhood parks, and play fields. These five acres can be dispersed throughout the development site, as long 
as the total acreage of park and recreational areas is equivalent to five acres.    

Improvements shall not be permitted in the increased open space cited above but shall be permitted on the land 
allocated to meet the minimum open space requirement under the base zone designation.  Proposed 
improvements must be approved by the Planning Director and Parks and Recreation Director.    This exchange 
cannot be offered in conjunction with the open space improvement unless approved by the Director of Parks and 
Recreation.  The parks and recreation areas must be owned and maintained by the developer and/or a 
homeowners’ association. 

Parking in the Rear for Multi-Family:  Parking for multi-family development shall be located in the rear of the 
buildings. 

Parking in the Rear for Commercial/Office Use:  Parking for commercial and office developments shall be 
located in the rear of the buildings.  

Limited Access:  Access to single-family attached and detached dwellings shall be provided from alleys and/or 
shared driveways. 

Low Density Along the Edge:  Lower density residential development along the perimeter of the development 
site or adjacent to existing single-family residential development on adjoining properties.  For the purpose of 
this exchange, lower density residential is defined as a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet.  

Dedicated Open Space:  Land allocated and dedicated to the City for future parks and public greenways in 
accordance with the City’s greenway/future park plan.  The land must be dedicated after the PDD rezoning is 
approved by the City Council and prior to the first preliminary plat submission. 

 
No request for an incentive shall be accepted unless an exchange is offered. An exchange is a public benefit 
or amenity provided by an applicant or developer for additional development capacity.  The developer shall 
have the option of choosing from the list the exchange to offer for the incentive.   
 
A planned development shall be allowed only two development incentives. The entire area shown on a Master 
Development Plan shall constitute a planned development site for the purpose of allocating incentives and 
exchanges. 
 
Requests for incentives and the reasons therefore shall be set forth by the applicant in the application for 
PDD approval. The applicant shall explain in his request how each incentive would benefit, and not be 
detrimental, to the public interest.  The benefits derived from the exchange may not necessarily impact the 
development itself.   
 
No incentives may be allowed when the proposed modification would result in: 
 

(1) Traffic volume exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in 
the vicinity of the planned development. 

 
(2) An undue burden on community facilities, such as schools, fire and police protection, 

utilities, and other such facilities. 
 
(3) Detrimental impact on surrounding land uses. 
  
(4) Incompatibility with the goals of the Land Use Plan. 
 
(5) Negative impact on the local watersheds. 

V-26



 
 

 
Staff will review each request for incentive as requested and address the above findings in the staff report.  
The burden of proof that these criteria are not being violated shall rest with the applicant and not the staff.    
 
Development incentives, if granted, shall supersede the applicable regulations of the base and PDD zoning 
districts of the planned development.   
 
All incentives requested and exchanges offered relative to density bonuses, minimum lot width, open space, 
perimeter buffer, parking and low density must be reflected on the proposed Master Development Plan as 
presented to the Planning Commission or City Council for approval.  Incentives shall become a component 
of the Master Development Plan and shall be binding upon all future development on the site.  Incentives 
shall be subject to requirements pursuant to Sections 504.03 and 504.04.  
 
Section 505.   Master Development Plan. 
 
A Master Development Plan is a conceptual drawing that provides for the coordinated development of a 
specific area.  A Master Development Plan shall be required if one or more of the following is proposed: 
 

A. When any development site is to be developed in stages or phases, no plat or phase plan 
for any fraction of the site shall be accepted for review which has more than the maximum 
gross density or less than the minimum required open space pursuant to Table 4-2, unless 
a Master Development Plan is submitted (See Section 802.09) 

 
B. When a request is made for Planned Development District (PDD) zoning.

and other common properties.  

 
12. Required bufferyards. 
 
13. Name or numbering of phases. 

 
505.01. Written Report to Accompany the Master Development Plan. The master development plan map 
shall be accompanied by a written report, to be adopted as a part of the master development plan that includes 
the following information:  

  
1. Methods of screening and buffering, where incompatible land use configurations 

necessitate protection for the proposed development or surrounding development. 
 
2. Provisions for creation, use and maintenance of open space and recreation areas. 
 
3. Significant natural topographical, natural features of the subject property and preservation 

of natural features of the land.

study is necessary.  Refer to Section 435 of the City of Auburn Zoning Ordinance for the 
contents of the transportation impact report. 

 
10. A statement on the type of commercial development proposed, including total square 

footage, setback, building coverage and height, impervious surfaces and off-street parking. 
  
11. A development schedule including projected build-out date (see Section 504.02). 
 
12. A valid legal description of the property of the total proposed site. 
 
13. Design standards, if required. 
 
14. Any other information the Planning Director or Planning Commission determines to be 

relevant to evaluate the character and impact of the proposed planned development. 
  

Certain informational requirements contained in this subsection may be waived upon a determination by the 
Planning Director that they are not applicable or necessary to the proposed application. 
 
Upon approval, the written report shall become a component of the Master Development Plan and shall be 
binding upon all future development on the site. 
 
505.02. Phasing and Staging the Master Development Plan. 
 
Nothing within this Section precludes an applicant from delineating the development site into geographic 
areas called phases.  Each phase of a development shall be able to exist as an independent stable unit.  The 
phases shall be indicated by a numeric system or subdivision names.  The phasing of a development site shall 
in no way indicate the stages of development.  
 
Staging is the timing and geographical sequence of development.  The applicant may elect to develop the site 
in successive stages in a manner consistent with the Master Development Plan.  The Planning Commission 
may require that the development be done in stages if public utilities are not adequate to service the entire 
development initially.   
 
The staging of a planned development shall consist of a development schedule indicating the approximate 
date when construction of the various phases can be expected to begin and be completed.  This schedule shall 
show a steady progression toward completion of the project.  If the planned development is expected to be 
constructed in stages or according to phases during a period extending beyond a single construction season 
(18 months), a development schedule shall be submitted with the Master Development Plan indicating: 
  

(A) The approximate date when construction of the project can be expected to begin; 
 
(B)  The order and timing in which the phases of the project will be built and the estimated time 

of completion of each phase; 
 
(C) The land area, density, the approximate location of common open space and facilities, and 

public improvements that will be required at each stage. 
 
(D) The Planning Commission may require a planting schedule for landscaping and 

bufferyards, which assures that these amenities are provided at substantially the same rate 
as residential dwelling units. 

 
The development schedule is a required component of the Master Development Plan that is not binding upon 
the applicant but shall be used for informational purposes. 
 
The Planning Commission may waive a development schedule upon submission of written justification by 
the applicant. 

V-29



 
 

 
505.03. Process for PDD and Master Development Plan Approval.   
 
Pre-Application Conference. The applicant and/or his or her representatives are required to confer with the 
City’s development staff prior to the submission of a PDD application, a mixed-use development plan or a 
development plan involving stages of development.  Representatives from the Planning Department, Water 
Resource Management, and Engineering Services Departments shall attend.  The purpose of the conference 
is to exchange information and receive guidance concerning the process for approval and the provision of the 
PDD zone.   
 
Submission of the Application.  An application for approval for a development site requiring a Master 
Development Plan shall include:  the application, the Master Development Plan (Section 504), the written 
report (Section 504.01), staging of development schedule (Section 504.02) and required fees.   
 
Planning Division Review and Recommendation:  After the receipt of the application and all pertinent 
attachments, the Planning Department shall prepare a staff report to the planning commission containing their 
findings: 
 

A. As to the suitability of the site for the planned development zoning proposed and the 
relation of the proposed development to the surrounding areas as it relates to existing and 
probable future development; 

 
B. As to the suitability of proposed streets to adequately carry anticipated traffic, and whether 

increased densities will generate traffic in such an amount as to overload the street network 
outside the development site. 

 
C. As to access to utilities and proposed utility services that will be adequate for the population 

densities proposed. 
 
D. As to proper justification for the development proposed, including commercial, and its 

consistency with the Land Use Plan and adopted development policy of the City of Auburn. 
 
E. As to the impact the proposed development would have on local natural resources in the 

general area. 
 
F. As to whether the applicant submitted the application and all relevant materials and 

adequately addressed all the information required in the written report.  The applicant’s 
written report shall be submitted as part of the Planning Department’s staff report. 

 
G. As to the proposed development compliance with this Ordinance, the Land Use Plan and 

other plans, maps, and ordinance adopted by the City to guide its growth and development. 
 

Based upon such findings, the Planning Department shall recommend to the planning commission approval, 
approval with conditions, or disapproval of the Master Development Plan and the rezoning, if the application 
is a request for a PDD. 
 
Action by the Planning Commission.  Following the receipt of the Planning Department staff report, the 
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing and review staff’s report along with the Master 
Development Plan.  The Planning Commission shall recommend to the city council either approval of the 
Master Development Plan as proposed, approval subject to conditions and modifications, or denial with 
reasons therefor. 
 
City Council Review and Approval.  After receipt of the recommendation from the Planning Commission, 
the City Council shall hold a public hearing and render a decision on any Master Development Plan and any 
request for rezoning, if the application is a request for a PDD.  The City Council shall approve, approve with 

V-30



 
 

conditions set forth by the Planning Commission, approve with conditions or modifications imposed by City 
Council, or deny the Master Development Plan. 
 
505.04. Reapplication if Denied.  If a request for Master Development Plan approval is denied, the matter 
cannot be reopened or be the subject of a new request for at least one year unless the conditions have changed 
significantly from the first time it was heard.  A request for re-hearing less than one year from the date of the 
initial hearing must include evidence that the conditions pertinent to the case have changed significantly.  If 
after reviewing the request, the Planning Commission is convinced that there has been significant change, 
then a new application shall be filed. 
 
505.05. Conditional Use Approval and the Plan.  Approval of the Master Development Plan shall 
constitute conditional use approval for performance residential uses as set forth in the Master Development 
Plan and in accordance with the PDD zoning district on Table 4-1.  Nonresidential uses in a planned or 
mixed-use development are subject to a separate conditional use approval process by the Planning 
Commission and City Council prior to an application for a zoning certificate.   
 
505.06. Density and Open Space Standards for Individual Stages.  A Master Development Plan shall be 
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission prior to or simultaneously with any regular site plan or 
subdivision plat submitted.  Upon approval of the Master Development Plan, the developer may submit and 
the Planning Commission may approve subdivision plats or site plans for individual phases or stages. 
 
Where any development site is to be developed in stages, no plat or phase plan for any fraction of the site 
shall be accepted for review which has more than the maximum gross density or less than the minimum 
required open space as shown in this section.   
 
No individual stage shall exceed the following density or fail to meet the minimum open space percentage: 

 
 

 
Zoning District Maximum 

Density* 
(Units/Acre) 

Minimum Open 
Space (Percent) 

CDD 14 15 
LDD 7.5 20 
DDH 8 15 
MDRD 16 10 
NRD 12 15 
RDD 24 10 
CRD-U 20 10 
CRD-S 14 15 
CRD-W 14 10 
CRD-E 16 10 

        *Refer to Tables 4-1, 5-1, 5-2 and Section 502.02 for 
        density requirements for other zoning districts not listed 
 
When submitting a plat for individual stages or phases of development, the applicant must submit a boundary 
survey for that stage of the development. 
 
505.07. Changes or Modification to the Plan.  Once approved, the Master Development Plan shall become 
a binding condition of development on the site, and subsequent stages or phases of the development shall be 

V-31



 
 

substantially consistent with it.  Approval of such plan shall bind the applicant, owner and mortgagee or any 
subsequent ownership interest, if any, with respect to the contents of such plan. 
 
If the Planning Director finds that any stage or phase plan substantially deviates from the approved Master 
Development Plan, a new master plan shall be required for Planning Commission review prior to approval 
of further site plans or subdivision plats within the development. 
Any of the following changes shall constitute a “substantial deviation:” 
 

A. An increase or reduction in land area of the development. 
 
B. An increase in the total number of dwelling units. 
 
C. Provision of less than the required percentage of recreation, resource protection, or open 

space land. 
 
D. Proposal of single family attached, duplex, multi-family or zero lot-line development in 

place of approved single family detached housing. 
 
E. Any significant addition, removal or rearrangement of land uses or streets. 
 

505.08. Termination of Approved Plan.  Implementation of the Master Development Plan must commence 
within the 24 months following approval.  Commencement of a Plan shall mean the recording of a final plat 
covering at least a portion of the development site.  Recognizing that conditions may change during extended 
periods of time to such an extent that approved plans for a planned development may not be in the public 
interest, failure to actively pursue an authorized planned development shall automatically reverse the 
rezoning and the property shall revert to its prior zoning designation, and the Master Development Plan will 
no longer be valid.  In cases where the PDD approval was accompanied by a base zone rezoning (i.e., from 
Rural to any eligible PDD base zone, for example), the base zone shall also revert to its prior zoning 
designation.    
 
Section 506.  Mixed-Used Developments. 
 
506.01. Purpose.  Developments, other than those within a Planned Development District (PDD), which 
include more than one use on the same site, and in which the uses fall into two or more different use 
categories, shall be treated as mixed-use developments; and are required to meet the standards of this Section 
in addition to any other regulations imposed by this Ordinance. 
 
506.02. Treatment of Mixed Developments.  All uses proposed within a mixed-use development must be 
permitted under Table 4-1 in the district in which the development is to be located.  Uses shown in Table 4-
1 as conditional must be approved under the provisions of Section 803. 
 
For review purposes, a separate development site for each land use category shall be delineated within a 
mixed-use development wherever possible.  For shopping centers and any other case in which the different 
land uses occupy a single structure, the most restrictive requirements relating to any of the individual uses 
will be applied to the entire site. 
 
506.03. Residential Uses in the Urban Core District.  Residential uses are allowed in the Urban Core 
District only in accordance with the restrictions listed below. 
 

A. A mixed-use facility in the Urban Core District may consist of: 
 

1. Any commercial, retail, office, or institutional use permitted in this District as set 
forth in Table 4-1 of this Ordinance; and 

 
2. One dwelling unit within the same structure as the commercial use in the case of 

a townhouse development; or.

3. Three or more dwelling units within the same structure as the commercial use in 

the case of multiple unit development. 
 

B. Each living unit shall have a minimum floor area of 400 square feet. 
 
C. As many dwelling units may be constructed in a mixed commercial/residential facility as 

would be permitted if the floor area ratio for the Urban Core District (Table 4-3) were 
applied to the entire mixed commercial/residential facility. 

 
D. No off-street parking will be required for nonresidential uses in the Urban Core District 

(Section 513.02). 
 
E. Prior to construction of new structures or expansion of existing structures, a site plan shall 

be reviewed and approved pursuant to Article VIII. 
 
506.04. Mixed Uses in the Urban Neighborhood District (UN-E, UN-W and UN-S).  Mixed uses are 
allowed in the Urban Neighborhood District only in accordance with the restrictions listed below.

1. Any commercial, retail, office, or institutional use permitted in this District as set 
forth in Table 4-1 of this Ordinance; and 

 
2. One dwelling unit within the same structure as the commercial use in the case of 

a townhouse development; or. 
 
3. Three or more dwelling units within the same structure as the commercial use in 

the case of multiple unit development. 
 

B. Each living unit shall have a minimum floor area of 400 square feet. 
 
C. As many dwelling units may be constructed in a mixed commercial/residential facility as 

would be permitted if the floor area ratio for the Urban Neighborhood District (Section 
509) were applied to the entire mixed commercial/residential facility. 

 
D. Off-street parking will be required for residential and nonresidential uses in the Urban 

Neighborhood District (Section 513.01 and 513.02). 
 
E. Prior to construction of new structures or expansion of existing structures, a site plan shall 

be reviewed and approved pursuant to Article VIII. 
 
Section 507. Urban Core (UC) District. 
 
507.01. Conflict with other Sections.  Where this is conflict between these Urban Core (UC) District 
provisions and other sections of the Zoning Ordinance, regulations for the Urban Core (UC) District shall 
govern.

Articulation in Structure Height: For buildings 100 feet or more in length, the 
street-facing roof line must have a variation in height. On a corner lot, the 
variation in height must be located at the corner of the building that addresses 
both street fronts. Parapets and other prominent architectural details visible 
from the street which rise above the roofline may account for the required 
articulation in structure height. 

Articulation in Building Façade: Buildings 100 feet or more in length must use 
changes in the depth of plane to create variations in the building face along the 
street frontage. 

Forecourts: A portion of the building, not to exceed thirty percent (30%) of the 
street frontage but not less than ten (10) feet in width, may be used as a recessed 
area along the front plane for additional entrances and amenity space. 
Vehicular access shall be prohibited in this space. A maximum of one forecourt 
is permitted per structure. 

Functional Entrances 
Ground story uses along the street frontage, including ground story residential, 
shall provide a functional entrance no greater than seventy-five (75) feet apart.

rooftop equipment or ventilation apparatus.  

Mixed Use Provisions  
Buildings 100 feet or greater must contain an active use at the ground story for 
no less than 70% of the length of any street frontage. No more than 50% of 
ground story street frontage shall be used as private amenity space for exclusive 
use by residents of the building. The Planning Director may reduce the 

V-35



 
 

minimum frontage of active use space required to accommodate for unique 
circumstances. Such reductions shall not exceed ten (10) feet. 

Corner lots shall locate any nonresidential uses at the intersection of the highest 
street classification. Garage entrances, mechanical rooms, blank walls, and 
areas inaccessible to the general public are prohibited on building corners.

Parking Requirement  

Residential uses in the UC shall provide one (1) parking space per bedroom.  
Required parking shall be provided either: 

a) On Site; 
b) Within one thousand (1,000 feet) of the development site through an 

arrangement with the property owner or lessee (a long-term lease, 
recorded easement, etc.) acceptable to the Planning Director that will 
be filed with the Planning Department and verified annually; or 

c) By payment into a City parking fund in a standard amount established 
by the City Council, should the City Council choose to establish such 
a fund. 

Hotel and condotel uses shall be subject to parking requirements as set forth in 
Section 513.02(B). 

No off-street parking will be required for nonresidential uses in the Urban Core 
(UC) District; however, no more than 50% of the gross surface area of any 

V-36



 
 

property within the Urban Core (UC) shall be utilized for vehicular drives or 
parking spaces. This limitation shall not apply to parking garages or parking 
otherwise incorporated into habitable building structures. 

Parking Lot Screening 

Surface parking must be screened with a structure.  In cases where the parking 
cannot be screened by a structure of the permitted use as determined by the 
Planning Director, parking adjacent to any street ROW must be separated with 
a planted buffer at least ten (10) feet wide. 

The planting requirement shall be 1 canopy tree and 6 shrubs for every twenty-
five (25) feet of ROW frontage.  The planting requirements and buffer width 
may vary due to site conditions at the discretion of the Planning Director. 

Ground story parking in a structure shall be setback no less than 15 feet from 
the property line and shall be screened using an appropriate façade composition 
or use. Where upper stories of structured parking are located at the perimeter 
of a building, they must be screened so that cars are not visible from adjacent 
streets. Sloped ramps must not be discernable along the perimeter of the 
parking structure. Architectural and/or vegetative screens must be used to 
articulate the façade, hide parked vehicles and shield lighting.  

Surface parking adjacent to any street ROW shall also be screened with a Type 
1, Option A fence (see Figure 4-2) with support piers that meet the Cladding 
Materials and Exterior Wall Palette requirements of this section. 

Streetscape and Public 
Improvements 

For streetscape or other public improvements see Section 5 of the Engineering 
Design and Construction Manual and any adopted streetscape plans for streets 
that the development is adjacent to. 

Signage See Section 605.04. (A.), Building Signs in the Urban Core, College Edge 
Overlay District, and Urban Neighborhood Districts. 

Balconies 

A license agreement shall be required for any balcony projection into the right-
of-way.  The license agreement must be approved prior to construction release 
or issuance of a building permit.  Application for any balcony encroachment 
must be made to both the Planning Director and the City Engineer for review, 
and the format of the license shall be determined and approved by the City 
Attorney.  Official approval of such agreement shall be by resolution of the 
City Council.   

Buildings with balconies must have covenants that prohibit leaving unsightly 
debris, clothing, banners or other materials visible from public view.  
Enforcement of covenants shall be the responsibility of the Homeowners’ or

Open Space 
Requirements 

0.15 open space shall be required for Performance Residential Developments 
on parcels greater than one (1) acre.   

On parcels less than one (1) acre, no separate platted open space lots shall be 
required, however the required 0.15 open space shall be calculated and 
subtracted from the developable parcel.  The remainder of this calculation will 
be the basis for determining the total of units allowed.  The open space 
calculation shall be divided equally among and attached to each lot.  This 
minimum open space shall be designated on the subdivision plat and shall not 
be used for the placement of any structures, parking, or bufferyard. 

Example:  For a single-family performance residential, the minimum lot size is 
5,000 s.f.  
     22,000 s.f. x 0.15 = 3300 
     22,000 – 3300 = 18,700 
     18,700 ÷ 5,000 = 3.74 lots.   

The maximum number of lots allowed would be 3.  The minimum amount of 
open to be added to each lot would be 1,100 s.f.

1, Option A fence (see Figure 4-2) with support piers that are clad with stone, 
brick, stucco or architecturally decorative concrete block. 

West of South or North Ross Street: 

Grade level parking (surface or structured) must be screened with a structure.  
In cases where the parking cannot be screened by a structure of the permitted 
use as determined by the Planning Director, parking adjacent to any street 
ROW must be separated with a planted buffer at least ten (10) feet wide.   

East of South or North Ross Street: 

Grade level parking (surface or structured) must be located behind the front 
building facades. Grade level structured parking located at the perimeter of a 
structure must be screened so that cars are not visible from adjacent streets. 
Screening must use approved cladding material or vegetation to hide parked 
vehicles and shield lighting. Sloped ramps must not be discernable along the 
perimeter of the parking structure. In cases where the parking cannot be 
screened by a structure of the permitted use as determined by the Planning

V-49



 
 

Articulation in Structure Height: For buildings 100 feet or more in length, the 
street-facing roof line must have a variation in height. On a corner lot, the 
variation in height must be located at the corner of the building that addresses 
both street fronts. Parapets and other prominent architectural details visible 
from the street which rise above the roofline may account for the required 
articulation in structure height. 

Articulation in Building Façade: Buildings 100 feet or more in length must use 
changes in the depth of plane to create variations in the building face along the 
street frontage. 

Forecourts: A portion of the building, not to exceed thirty percent (30%) of the 
street frontage but not less than ten (10) feet in width, may be used as a recessed 
area along the front plane for additional entrances and amenity space. 
Vehicular access shall be prohibited in this space. A maximum of one forecourt 
is permitted per structure. 

Façade Composition 

The maximum length of individual façade compositions along a required 
building line, generally running parallel to the street frontage, shall be 100 feet. 
Each façade composition shall be distinct by means of material changes, 
fenestration, and/or configuration of architectural elements. 

Fenestration 

The percentage of openings for glass fenestration of nonresidential uses at 
street level (ground story) visible from the street is required to be a minimum 
of 30% of the total façade area measured from floor to floor. 

The percentage of openings for glass fenestration at the second story visible 
from the street is required to be a minimum of 20% of the total façade area 
measured from floor to floor. 

The percentage of openings for glass fenestration at the third story and above 
visible from the street is required to be a minimum of 20% of the total façade 
area measured from floor to floor. 

The maximum bulkhead height of the ground story is four (4) feet above the 
grade level. Spandrel areas shall be no larger than six (6) feet in height for all 
ground story fenestration. 

Colored or mirrored glass is not permitted. 

Cladding Materials 

Building materials shall consist of stone, masonry, ceramic tile, terracotta tile, 
wood (not composite), precast concrete and traditional “hard coat” stucco or 
brick with accents of stucco, limestone, or wood.  If synthetic materials are 
used, they must simulate natural materials and are limited to architectural trim 
and cornices. 

Visible sloped roofing shall be slate, asphalt shingles, copper, or pre-finished 
kynar paint coated metal.  (See Urban Core Development Guidelines.)     

Concealed Equipment 
and Prohibited Products 
 

The following shall be located or screened so as not to be visible from any 
public street:  air conditioning compressors, window and wall air conditioners, 
dumpsters, electrical and other utility meters, irrigation and pool pumps, 
permanent barbeques, satellite antennae, utility appurtenances, mechanical 
rooftop equipment or ventilation apparatus.  

Mixed Use Provisions 
Buildings 100 feet or greater must contain an active use at the ground story for 
no less than 70% of the length of any street frontage. The Planning Director 
may reduce the minimum frontage of active use space required to 

V-50



 
 

accommodate for unique circumstances. Such reductions shall not exceed ten 
(10) feet. 

Corner lots shall locate any nonresidential uses at the intersection of the highest 
street classification. Garage entrances, mechanical rooms, blank walls, and 
areas inaccessible to the general public are prohibited on building corners. 

Garages, blank walls, service entries, or mechanical rooms shall not exceed 
30% of the ground story street frontage. 

Residential Use 
Provisions 

Ground story residential units shall be designed as independent living units 
with a primary entrance that takes access from the public right of way or nearest 
sidewalk. No more than four individual units may share said entryway. Units 
on the 3rd story and above shall take separate access interior to the building. 

Minimum unit width: 18 feet 
Maximum unit width: 50 feet 
Minimum front setback: 5 feet 
Minimum fenestration: 30% 

 (See Section 502.02(A.) for fee-simple Single-family detached) 

Open Space 
Requirements* 

0.15 open space shall be required for Performance Residential Developments 
on parcels greater than one (1) acre.   

On parcels less than one (1) acre, no separate platted open space lots shall be 
required, however the required 0.15 open space shall be calculated and 
subtracted from the parcel.  The remainder of this calculation will be the basis 
for determining the total of units allowed.  The open space calculation shall be 
divided equally among and attached to each lot.  This minimum open space 
shall be designated on the subdivision plat and shall not be used for the 
placement of any structures, parking, or bufferyard. 

Example:  For a single-family performance residential, the minimum lot size is 
5,000 s.f.  
     22,000 s.f. x 0.15 = 3300 
     22,000 – 3300 = 18,700 
     18,700 ÷ 5,000 = 3.74 lots.   

The maximum number of lots allowed would be 3.  The minimum amount of 
open to be added to each lot would be 1,100 s.f.   

Parking Requirement 

See Section 513 for parking requirement. 

A maximum of 20 percent of required parking spaces may be provided off-site 
at a public parking facility through a lease arrangement with the City of 
Auburn. Development approval is subject to availability of the needed number 
of spaces at a City-owned parking facility. 

Parking Lot Screening 

Grade level parking (surface or structured) must be located behind the front 
building facades.  Grade level structured parking located at the perimeter of a 
structure must be screened so that cars are not visible from adjacent streets. 
Screening must use approved cladding material or vegetation to hide parked 
vehicles and shield lighting. Sloped ramps must not be discernable along the 
perimeter of the parking structure. In cases where the parking cannot be 
screened by a structure of the permitted use as determined by the Planning 
Director, parking adjacent to any street ROW must be separated with a planted 
buffer at least five (5) feet wide.    

V-51



 
 

The planting requirement shall be 1 canopy tree and 6 shrubs for every twenty-
five (25) feet of ROW frontage.  The planting requirements and buffer width 
may vary due to site conditions at the discretion of the Planning Director. 

Surface parking adjacent to any street ROW shall also be screened with a Type 
1, Option A fence (see Figure 4-2) with support piers that are clad with stone, 
brick, stucco or architecturally decorative concrete block. 

Streetscape and Public 
Improvements 

For streetscape or other public improvements see Section 5 of the Engineering 
Design and Construction Manual and any adopted streetscape plans for streets 
that the development is adjacent to.

Balconies 

A license agreement shall be required for any balcony projection into the right-
of-way.  The license agreement must be approved prior to construction release 
or issuance of a building permit.  Application for any balcony encroachment 
must be made to both the Planning Director and the City Engineer for review, 
and the format of the license shall be determined and approved by the City 
Attorney.  Official approval of such agreement shall be by resolution of the 
City Council.  Buildings with balconies must have covenants that prohibit 
leaving unsightly debris, clothing, banners or other materials visible from 
public view.  Enforcement of covenants shall be the responsibility of the 
Homeowners’ or Condominium Association.  

Awnings and Canopies 

Sloped or flat awnings and canopies are allowed.  Awnings fabricated of canvas 
or metal are allowed.  Awnings may be placed above and extend the width of 
any door or window, or extend up to 85% of the width of the building façade 
along the street line, whichever is greater; and must be supported from the 
building façade with suspension rods.    

Support structures for awnings or canopies cannot extend from the sidewalk. 

Awnings slopes may be flat to 45 degrees maximum and may not exceed 5 feet 
in vertical height. 

Waivers 

Applicants should meet early on with Planning staff and refer to the Downtown 
Design Guidelines for additional information and recommendations. These 
standards shall be met in addition to all other standards of this Ordinance, 
unless specifically exempted. Any proposed deviation from these standards

Open Space Requirements See Table 4-2 for minimum open space requirements. 

Parking Requirement 

See Section 502.02 for performance residential use standards. 

See Section 513 for parking requirement for non-residential uses. 

In CRD-E, parking shall be behind the facade of all buildings and 
screening shall be provided for all parking areas.  Corner lots shall take 
access from the street with the lowest street classification. 

Cross Access 

Cross access points should be provided connecting parking lots or other 
access ways.   Cross access should be located at the rear of the property.  If 
cross-access is provided from the adjoining property, the access shall be 
continued through the property. If a neighborhood or corridor plan for the 
area exists, cross access points should be provided where indicated in the 
plan if feasible.  The Planning Director and City Engineer may grant relief 
from this requirement if topographical issues or structures prevent the 
connection from being made. 

Pedestrian Connectivity 

All developed sites shall provide at least one continuous, on-site intra-
parcel pedestrian way of at least five feet (5'-0") in width to connect 
sidewalks adjoining rights-of-way to the main entrance(s) of that property's 
building(s), in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA). The Planning Director and City Engineer may grant relief from 
this requirement if topographical issues or structures prevent the 
connection from being made. 

Parking Lot Screening 

Parking for non-residential and mixed-use developments must be located 
behind the front building facades.   

Parking adjacent to any street ROW shall be screened with a Type 1, 
Option A fence (see Figure 4-2) with support piers that are clad with stone, 
brick, stucco or architecturally decorative concrete block and landscaped 
with 1 canopy tree and 6 shrubs for every twenty-five (25) feet of ROW 
frontage between the fence and street.  The planting requirements and 
buffer width may vary due to site conditions at the discretion of the 
Planning Director. 

It is also the desire of the Renew Opelika Road Corridor Plan and the 
Northwest Auburn Neighborhood Plan that residential use parking be 

V-54



 
 

located behind building facades.  To achieve this, an increase in the 
impervious surface ratio (ISR), not to exceed 20% will be allowed. 

Landscaping 

Sites must meet the general landscaping requirements in Section 422 unless 
specifically excluded in this section. 

Bufferyards: 

Street-trees – Where a street tree master plan has been implemented for a 
particular street which the development site fronts; the plantings from the 
street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for 
that particular frontage. If the Planning Director determines that the 
requirements of the street tree master plan cannot be met, the general 
landscaping requirements of Section 422 must be met. 

Side and rear bufferyards may be reduced or waived by the Planning 
Director if the adjoining uses are similar in nature or if the buildings are 
built in a continuous urban form that would be interrupted by a greenspace. 

Decks, porches, balconies and pedestrian areas, including plazas, street 
arcades, courtyards, and outdoor cafes may extend into bufferyards.  In no 
case shall the encroachment exceed 60 percent of the length of the property 
line of the particular bufferyard. 

Building Facade 

The development shall have primary entrances that face and open directly 
on to publicly accessible streets or public open spaces.  Buildings may use 
an alternative entrance provided that there is outdoor dining or integrated 
display area between the building and public street. 

If the building is located on a corner lot, the building may face the corner.   
Development Sites with multiple buildings must only have the façade of 
the principal building facing the primary street.   Additional buildings may 
face internal drives or secondary streets.   

Cladding Materials 

Sites must meet requirements of Section 429 Corridor Overlay Standards.  
The Planning Commission may allow greater amounts of architectural 
metal provided it is approved by Planning Commission.  Corrugated metal 
or sheet metal may only be used as accent or to clad areas not visible from 
any designated corridor. 

Concealed Equipment and 
Prohibited Products 

The following shall be located or screened so as not to be visible from any 
public street:  air conditioning compressors, window and wall air 
conditioners, dumpsters, electrical and other utility meters, irrigation and 
pool pumps, permanent barbeques, satellite antennae, utility 
appurtenances, mechanical rooftop equipment or ventilation apparatus.  

Signage  

CRD-U, CRD-E, CRD-S and CRD-W west of North Donahue Drive:  

See Section 605, Permitted Signs 

CRD-W east of North Donahue Drive: 

Building signs and sandwich board signs as defined in Article VI are the 
only signs that are allowed in the CRD-W east of North Donahue Drive. 
Signs may be attached to any building façade.  In a multi-tenant building, 
the building owner is responsible for distributing the sign allowance among 
the tenants.  

V-55



 
 

Electronic reader boards are prohibited in the CRD-W district east of North 
Donahue Drive.   

Single story building - Building facades that face a public street or that 
have the main entrance may have one (1) square foot of sign area for each 
(1) linear foot of building or space width, or sixteen (16) square feet, 
whichever is greater, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. Other building 
facades may have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear 
foot of building width, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. 

Multi-story building - Building facades that face a public street or that have 
the main entrance may have two (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) 
linear foot of building or space width or thirty-two (32) square feet, 
whichever is greater, but no more than seventy-five (75) square feet. Other 
building facades may have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each 
(1) linear foot of building width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square 
feet. 

Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square 
feet can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade 
that has a sidewalk or entrance.  A blade mounted sign is defined as an 
ornamental rod extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging 
sign suspended from it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street 
ROW. Blade signs are to be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above 
sidewalk level to the bottom of the blade sign.  Text and graphics on either 
or both ends of an awning that are oriented perpendicular to the building 
face for pedestrian view and are no more than six (6) square feet may be 
provided in lieu of a blade sign. 

All building signs must be mounted between the first and second floor line, 
or between the second and third floor line or near the top of the wall.  The 
Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate 
location for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause 
damage to architectural ornamentation of a building.  In any case, building 
signs may not be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the 
primary sign is computed by measuring the number of square feet in the 
smallest rectangle, within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of 
the sign can be enclosed.  

A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for 
placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being 
advertised, and is generally two (2) sided.  Sandwich board signs that meet 
all of the following criteria may be placed and displayed on a public 
sidewalk: 

a. A height of no more than four (4) feet; 
b. Maximum area of any side is eight (8) square feet; 
c. No illumination; 
d. Placed in front of the building or leased space during business 

hours respective to the use in the building or leased space; 
e. Maintains a clearance on the sidewalk of at least five (5) feet; and, 
f. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other 

sandwich board sign.   
 

Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side 
make it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich 
board spacing requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate designee, 

V-56



 
 

may approve an alternative location that maximizes distance between 
adjacent signs. 

Awnings and Canopies 

Sloped or flat awnings and canopies are allowed.  Awnings fabricated of 
canvas or metal are allowed.  Awnings may be placed above and extend 
the width of any door or window, or extend up to 75% of the width of the 
building façade along the street line, whichever is greater; and must be 
supported from the building façade with suspension rods.    

Support structures for awnings or canopies cannot extend from the 
sidewalk. 

Awnings slopes may be flat to 45 degrees maximum and may not exceed 
5 feet in vertical height. 

 
Section 511. Accessory Uses. 
 
511.01. Authorization.  Except as otherwise expressly provided or limited by this Ordinance, accessory 
structures and uses are permitted in any zoning district in connection with any principal use lawfully existing 
or permitted within such district.  Any question of whether a particular use is permitted as an accessory use 
by the provision of this Section shall be determined by the Planning Director pursuant to his or her authority 
to interpret the provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
511.02. Zoning certificate required.  No accessory use or structure shall be established or constructed unless 
a zoning certificate evidencing the compliance of such use or structure with the provisions of this Section 
and other applicable provision of this Ordinance shall have first been issued in accordance with Section 804. 
 
511.03. Use limitations.  In addition to complying with all other regulations, no accessory use shall be 
permitted unless it strictly complies with the following restrictions: 
 

A. The principal use or structure, together with any accessory use or structure, shall not jointly 
exceed the land use intensity class criteria in any given use class. 

 
B.  No accessory structure or use shall be constructed or established on any lot prior to the 

time of the substantial completion of the principal structure.  This shall not apply to 
agriculture-related structures in the Rural (R) District. 

 
D. No accessory structure or use on any lot shall cause any impervious surface ratio or exterior 

storage area to exceed the maximum permitted on the site by this Ordinance. 
 

D. In the case of all nonresidential uses:  accessory structures shall maintain the same 
minimum front, side, and rear yard as is required for the principal structure. 

 
E. No accessory structure shall be closer than ten (10) feet to a principal structure or closer 

than five (5) feet to any other accessory structure, unless it is attached to such principal or 
other structure by means of fully enclosed living area. 

 
F. Accessory structures and uses shall comply with all applicable area, bulk, and yard 

regulations. 
 
G. Accessory structures relating to residential uses shall be placed no less than ten (10) feet to

V-57



 
 

H. No accessory structure shall be placed within a required bufferyard or located closer than 
five (5) feet to a property line where no bufferyard is required. 

 
I. On corner lots, no accessory structure shall be located within the required setback for a 

side yard adjacent to a street. 
 
J. On any one (1) residential lot, the total accessory floor area of all structures shall be limited 

to 50 percent of the floor area of the principal structure.  This shall include open carports, 
gazebos and greenhouses, but no swimming pools.  Lots of three (3) acres or larger in the 
Rural (R) district shall be exempt from this limitation. 

 
The accessory uses and structures specifically mentioned below are subject to the following additional 
requirements: 
 
511.04. Detailed Accessory Use Regulations:  Home Occupations. 
 

A.   Purpose.  It is the purpose of this Section to provide residents of the City of Auburn a wide 
range of opportunities in the use of their residences in profitable activities.  However, the 
character of the City’s residential areas must also be preserved.  Therefore, these 
regulations shall ensure that such activities remain limited in scope so as not to interfere 
with the principal use of any residential neighborhood or development. 

 
B.   General Regulations.  All home occupations shall meet the following criteria: 

 
1. The home occupation must be clearly secondary and incidental to the use of the 

dwelling unit as a residence.  With the exception of homestays, no more than 25 
percent of the total floor area of the dwelling shall be used for the home 
occupation, to a maximum of 500 square feet.  For the purposes of this Section, 
“total floor area” shall include all heated and ventilated areas within the dwelling.  
Garages, carports, outside storage rooms, and porches shall be excluded. 

 
At the Planning Director’s option, a floor plan of the residence may be required, 
indicating the specific location(s) and extent of the business activity. 

 
2. The exterior appearance of the dwelling unit and/or premises shall not be altered, 

nor the occupation within the dwelling unit conducted, in any manner that would 
cause the premises to differ from its residential character or from the character of 
the neighborhood.

secured using a chain and padlock or locker. An aisle five feet (5’) in width shall be 
provided in the front or rear of a bicycle parking space to provide for entering and leaving 
the parking area. 

 
G.  “Inverted U” type bike rack is recommended although other racks may be used provided 

they meet certain performance requirements. Racks must be easily usable with both U-
locks and cable locks. Racks should support the bikes in a stable upright position so that a

each hump or loop shall count as one (1) bicycle space provided the parking area meets 
dimension standards in Item E of this Section. 

 
H.  When providing Class I bicycle parking spaces in a room or common locker, all required 

bicycle spaces shall be located inside that structure or shall be located in other areas

minimize the possibility of a parked bicycle being hit by a car. If a room not divided by 
individual spaces is used to meet the requirements, twelve (12) square feet of floor area 
shall be considered equivalent to one (1) bicycle parking space. Where manufactured metal 
lockers or racks are provided, each locker or stall devoted to bicycle parking shall be 
counted as one (1) bicycle parking space. 

 
I.  Bicycle parking shall be located in close proximity to the building’s entrance and clustered 

in lots. Racks must not be placed close enough to a wall or other obstruction so as to make 
use difficult.

All lighting fixtures incorporated into non-enclosed structures (i.e. gas pump canopies, car washes, etc.) must 
be fully recessed into the underside of such structures.  All lighting must be directed and/or shielded so as to 
focus lighting onto the use as established and away from adjacent property and areas of pedestrian and 
vehicular traffic including, but not limited to, sidewalks and streets.

in providing emergency care services (e.g., setting broken bones, treating lacerations, or tending to patients 
suffering injuries as a result of accidents, trauma, or medical conditions necessitating immediate medical 
care) on an outpatient basis. Outpatient surgical establishments have specialized facilities, such as operating 
and recovery rooms, and specialized equipment, such as anesthetic or X-ray equipment. 
 
Hospitals: Provide medical, diagnostic, and treatment services that include physician, nursing, and other 
health services to inpatients and the specialized accommodation services required by inpatients. Hospitals 
may also provide outpatient services as a secondary activity. Also provide inpatient health services, many of 
which can only be provided using the specialized facilities and equipment that form a significant and integral 
part of the production process. 
 
Junior Colleges: Establishments primarily engaged in furnishing academic, or academic and technical, 
courses and granting associate degrees, certificates, or diplomas below the baccalaureate level. The 
requirement for admission to an associate or equivalent degree program is at least a high school diploma or

methods. The training provided by these establishments may include the use of simulators and simulation 
methods.  
 
Nursing and Residential Care Facilities: Provide residential care combined with either nursing, supervisory, 
or other types of care as required by the residents. Facilities are a significant part of the production process 
and the care provided is a mix of health and social services with the health services being largely some level 
of nursing services. 
 
Putrescible Waste: Putrescible wastes are solid wastes which contain organic matter capable of being 
decomposed by microorganisms and of such character and proportion as to be capable of attracting or 
providing food for birds. 
 
Technical & Trade Schools: Establishments primarily engaged in offering vocational and technical training 
in a variety of technical subjects and trades. The training often leads to job-specific certification. Instruction 
may be provided in diverse settings, such as the establishments or client's training facilities, educational 
institutions, the workplace, or the home, and through diverse means, such as correspondence, television, the 
Internet, or other electronic and distance-learning methods. The training provided by these establishments

516.03. Airport Zones.  In order to carry out the provisions of this Section, airport zones are established 
which include all the land within the Airport Height Notification Zone (Subzone A and Subzone B), Airport 
Runway Protection Zone, and Airport Noise Impact Zone as they apply to the airport. Such zones are shown 
on the Auburn University Regional Airport Zone Map, consisting of one sheet, prepared by Charles Mosley 
and dated September 11, 2009.   This map is attached to this Ordinance and made a part hereof.  The map 
referred to in this Section is on file in the Planning Department. 
 
These airport zones shall be superimposed over existing zoning districts and the special requirements of these 
airport zoning regulations shall apply in addition to the requirements of the district within which a specific 
property is located (See Article IV). 
 
516.04. Area of Jurisdiction.   In order to protect the approaches of said airport, the jurisdiction of this 
Section of the ordinance is extended to all areas depicted on the Auburn University Regional Airport Map, 
including areas within the City of Auburn.  
 
516.05. Airport overlay zones. The City of Auburn hereby adopts three (3) airport overlay zones which are 
shown on the City zoning map. These zones are established to regulate development in proximity to the 
airport. The location of these overlay zones is hereby established by this section. Boundaries of these zones 
may be changed only by way of an amendment of the official zoning map, pursuant to this section of the 
zoning ordinance. All development applications for land within these overlay zones shall comply with the 
airport zoning regulations of this section. In addition, development within these airport overlay zones shall 
also comply with applicable underlying zoning district requirements as referenced in this zoning ordinance. 
The three airport overlay zones are as follows: 
   

A. Airport Height Notification Zone (Subzone A and Subzone B); 
B. Airport Runway Protection Zone; and 
C. Airport Noise Impact Zone (½ of longest planned runway). 

   
Where an airport overlay zone overlays a portion of a property, only that portion within the zone shall be 
affected by the zone regulations. Furthermore, in relation to applying runway protection zone and noise 
impact zone requirements, use regulations shall apply to the structure or facilities constituting the use and 

V-80



 
 

shall generally apply to accessory open space, landscape and buffering, stormwater management, or driveway 
and parking uses. 
 
516.06. Airport height notification zone and regulations. 
   
A. Establishment of zone. The airport height notification zone is hereby established as an overlay zone on 

the adopted City zoning map. This zone is established to regulate the height of structures and natural 
vegetation for areas in proximity to the public use airports located within the City of Auburn. The airport 
height notification zone, consists of two subzones, is defined as: 

   
Subzone A. The area surrounding each public use airport extending outward twenty 
thousand (20,000) feet from the ends and each side of all active runways. 
   
Subzone B. The area outside of Subzone A. 
 

B. Airport height definition. For the purposes of determining building height in the height notification zone, 
height shall be measured in feet above ground level, rounded to the highest foot. The total structure 
height shall include anything mounted on top of the structure, such as antennas, obstruction lights, 
lightning rods, etc. 

   
C. Height notification regulations. All applicants of development proposals for land within the height 

notification zone determined to be a potential airport obstruction shall forward a notice of proposed 
construction (form 7460) to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be reviewed for conformance 
with the obstructions standards detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77 Subpart C. (14 
CFR Part 77), as may be amended from time to time. 

   
1. A proposed development shall be determined to be a "potential airport 

obstruction" if the proposed development would result in a structure or natural 
vegetation having a height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward 
and upward from the ends and sides of a public use airport active runway at a 
slope of one (1) foot vertical to one hundred (100) feet horizontal outward to 
twenty thousand (20,000) feet for Subzone A or two hundred (200) feet above 
ground level for Subzone B. Applicants of any development proposal determined 
by the City to result in a structure(s) that constitutes a "potential airport 
obstruction" shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction during the 
development proposal review process by the Planning Director or his designee. 

   
No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for 
construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure which is 
determined by the City to be a "potential airport obstruction" unless a city airport 
construction permit is granted. 

  
2. Any proposed development which is not determined to be a "potential airport 

obstruction" is exempt from any airport height notification zone permitting 
regulations contained herein. 

 
3. Airport construction permit procedures and criteria for approval. Any applicant 

affected by a notice of potential obstruction may apply to the Planning Director 
for an airport construction permit. 

   
a.     Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit. 

   
i.     Applicants shall submit to the planning division a 

completed airport construction permit application form (as provided by 
the City) and a copy of the notice of proposed construction form 
submitted to the FAA for the project. Permit requests may be considered 

V-81



 
 

by the Planning Director concurrent with development plan approval 
consideration. 

   
ii.     Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, 

applicants shall submit to the planning division the final determination 
issued by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's notice of 
proposed construction submitted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77. 

   
b.     Criteria for granting an airport construction permit. 

   
i.     Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development 

and determined its construction would not exceed an obstruction 
standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the Planning Director shall grant a airport 
construction permit for the proposed development provided that a 
condition is attached to the permit approval to ensure that the approved 
structure(s) is marked and lighted prior to the issuance of a certificate of 
occupancy (C.O.) if so required by Chapter 14-60, in accordance with 
the standards of Rules of the Department of Transportation and Federal 
Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, as amended. 

   
ii.     Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and 

determined that the proposed development exceeds the obstruction 
standards of 14 CFR Part 77, no airport construction permit may be 
approved, and a City airport obstruction variance (see Section 907.04) 
must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed development to 
proceed. 

 
A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an 
airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a 
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of these 
regulations or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a 
permit is made. 

 
516.07. Airport runway protection zone and regulations. 
    
A.      Zone establishment. There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City 

zoning map a runway protection zone for areas at each end of every active runway as may be 
amended from time to time. Within a runway protection zone, certain uses are restricted or 
prohibited to reduce incompatibilities with normal airport operations and danger to public health. 

   
B.      Runway protection zone regulations. 
   

1.      Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited within the runway 
protection zone: 

 
a. Educational centers (including all types of primary and 

secondary schools, pre-schools, child care facilities). 
b. Hospitals, freestanding emergency care centers, 

nursing/convalescent home facilities. 
c. Assembly halls. 
d. Fuel storage facilities (excludes storage tanks for flammable 

and combustible liquids, compressed gasses, or liquefied 
petroleum gas necessary for the operation of medical 
facilities) 

   

V-82



 
 

2.     Permitted uses. Any use which is not prohibited in a runway protection zone as 
determined in a. above, is permitted within the runway protection zone, subject to 
compliance with applicable airport noise impact zone, airport height notification 
zone and zoning district regulations. 

 
516.08. Airport noise impact zone and regulations. 
   
A.     Zone establishment. There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City 

zoning map an airport noise impact zone for areas surrounding airport. The airport noise impact 
zone is an area in which special construction standards are recommended for new construction and 
alteration, moving and repair to minimize the impact of airport generated noise routinely produced 
by continuation of normal airport operations. The airport noise impact zone is defined as follows: 

   
An area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (½) the length of the longest planned runway 
on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. For land use control purposes, this 
boundary shall be considered to be consistent with the sixty-five (65) to seventy (70) level day night 
(ldn) zone determined by an official Part 150 Noise Study or other recognized study, such as an 
Environmental Assessment, if a study is completed. 

     
B.      Noise impact zone regulations. Provisions of this section shall apply to construction, alteration, 

moving, repair and use of any building or structure within the airport noise impact zone.   
 
 1. Applicants for building permits or permits granted by the Planning Department in the noise impact 

zone shall be provided information at the time of application regarding recommended amounts of 
noise level reduction (NLR) in the airport noise impact zone as established by this Ordinance as 
well as guidelines for how such noise reduction shall be achieved. 

       
516.09. Nonconforming Uses. 
 

1. Regulations not Retroactive. These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, 
lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure not conforming to these regulations as of the 
effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.  
Nonconforming vegetation is subject to removal per the provisions of § 516.12.6. 

 
2. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the owner of any existing 
nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to install, operate, and maintain thereon of such 
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport, Federal Aviation Administration, or 
State of Alabama, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such 
obstructions in accordance with FAA requirements.  Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, 
and maintained at the owner’s expense. 

 
3. Expansion of a Nonconforming Use.  Any existing nonconforming use as described in these 
regulations shall not be expanded by altering, replanting or otherwise enlarging it so as to increase in 
any way its hazard within the airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing or taking-off or to increase 
the potential hazard to persons assembled within a structure so located and used. 

 
516.10. Permits.  An applicant seeking development approval in an area within the airport overlay zones 
shall provide the following information in addition to any other information required in the permit 
application: 
 

a.  A map or drawing showing the location of the property in relation to the runway 
protection zone, height notification zone and noise impact zone. The City of 
Auburn Planning Department shall provide the applicant with the appropriate base 
maps on which to locate the property. 

 

V-83



 
 

b. Ground elevation profiles, a site plan, both drawn to scale, including the location 
(X and Y coordinates) and total height of all existing and proposed structures, 
measured in feet above the mean sea level. 

 
c. If a height variance is requested, the applicant will need to obtain a letter                                                                            

of support from the Airport. 
 
516.11. Enforcement.  The enforcement of this Section shall be subject to the powers and duties specified 
under Article IX of the zoning ordinance except as otherwise stated in this Section.  The Planning Director 
and the Official Building Inspector shall coordinate the enforcement of this Section with the Airport.  It shall 
be the duty of the Airport to advise the Planning Director and the Official Building Inspector of any violations 
of this Section.  
 
Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not 
more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine and 
imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a 
separate offense. 
 
Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the City of Auburn Planning Department upon a 
form published for this purpose.  Applications submitted to the Planning Department shall be promptly 
considered and approved or denied.  Applications for variances by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be 
transmitted by the Planning Director.   
 
516.12. Special Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no use within the 
City of Auburn shall interfere with any operation of an airborne aircraft using a public use airport. The 
following special requirements shall apply to proposed developments or land use practices that attract or 
sustain hazardous wildlife populations on or near airports that can significantly increase the potential for 
wildlife-aircraft collisions. 
 

1. The distance between the Airport’s aircraft movement areas, loading ramps, or aircraft 
parking areas and the wildlife attractant should be a distance of 10,000 feet.  A distance of 
5 statute miles is recommended, if the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife 
movement into or across the approach or departure airspace. 

 
For additional information please consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation 
Federal Aviation Administration for standard practices for locating certain land uses having 
the potential to attract hazardous wildlife to or in the vicinity of public use airports.  

 
2. Sludge disposal, effluent spraying, compost activities and any other waste disposa1 

activities should normally not be allowed within the property limits of the Airport.  
 
3. Disposal sites for putrescible material, i.e. garbage dumps, landfills, and other similarly 

licensed or titled facilities, are to be considered incompatible when located within 10,000 
feet of the Airport’s runways. 

 
4. Disposal sites for nonputrescible material, e.g. construction demolition waste, automobile 

junk yards, kitchen appliances, and incinerator ash residue, are normally considered 
incompatible to within 10,000 feet of a runway used by turbine powered aircraft. However, 
depending upon the specific proposal, the results of a site investigation, and the proposed 
location relative to the runway approach/departure paths, certain types of restricted 
nonputrescible disposal operations may be found non-objectionable off airport, provided 
assurances are obtained from the proponent, and included in the licensing process, that 
should the site cause an increase in bird activity which might be hazardous to safe aircraft 
operations, action will be taken to mitigate the hazard or close the site. 

 

V-84



 
 

5. Proposed developments which produce lights or illumination, smoke, glare or other visual 
hazards, or produce electronic interference with airport/airplane navigation signals are 
subject to the standards specified in the FAA Procedures Manual 7400-2C as may be 
applied and enforced by the state and/or federal governments. 

 
6. Vegetation in the airport north-south approach zone or the airport northwest-southeast 

approach zone must be removed if said vegetation penetrates the approach surfaces. 
 
Section 517. Flag Lots.  A flag lot is a lot that has minimal frontage on a publicly owned and maintained 
street, whose width some distance back from the street boundary line meets all Ordinance requirements.  The 
purpose of flag lots is to reduce the number of direct access points to arterial and collector roads.  Flag lots 
may be permitted, even though they do not meet the minimum lot width requirements at the street boundary 
line, subject to the following conditions: 
 

A. Flag lots shall be limited to single family residential use only.  No more than one (1) 
dwelling unit shall be authorized for any one (1) flag lot access strip. 

 
B. A flag lot may be used within a subdivision to provide a lot fronting on an arterial or 

collector road with access to an internal subdivision street.  In such cases, vehicular access 
to the lot from the arterial or collector shall be prohibited.  In any event, no more than 10 
percent of the lots in any subdivision may be approved as flag lots. 

 
C. Flag lots providing access to arterial or collector roads shall be prohibited. 
 
D. Flag lot “stems” or access strips shall be at least 25 feet in width as measured at the road 

frontage.  The land area within the access strip shall not count toward the following 
required minimum lot sizes: 

 
District      Minimum Lot Size 

 
Neighborhood Conservation (NC) 40,000 square feet, or 

greater if required by 
district sub-designation 

 
Development District Housing (DDH) 40,000 square feet 
 
Redevelopment (RDD) 20,000 square feet 
 
Large Lot Residential (LLRD) 1 acre 
 
Rural (R)     3 acres 
 
Limited Development (LDD) 40,000 square feet 
 
Comprehensive Development (CDD) 40,000 square feet 
 

E. Where otherwise consistent with the provisions of this section, flag lots may be created in 
groups not exceeding two (2); in such cases, access strips shall be adjacent to each other 
and form a total width of 50 feet.  A distance of 500 feet shall separate non-adjacent flag 
lot access strips on the same side of the road.  All access strips shall be at least 25 feet from 
an intersection. 

 
F. The Planning Director shall identify the front, side and rear lot lines of a flag lot for 

determining yard requirements, allowable locations of accessory structures, and other 
purposes. 

 

V-85



 
 

Section 518.  Conservation Overlay District (COD). 
  
518.01. Application of the Conservation Overlay District.  All land currently located in the Lake Ogletree 
Subwatershed is eligible for COD zoning as of the effective date of this amendment and as shown on the 
official City of Auburn Watershed Map adopted by Council on December 5, 2006.   The Conservation 
Overlay District zoning may be requested and considered for application in other parts of the City.  In these 
cases, the property must be zoned as Rural, LLRD, LDD, NC-11, NC-12, NC-14, NC-15, NC-18, NC-20, 
NC-26, NC-32, NC-35, NC-39, NC-48, NC-50, NC-54, NC-84, NC-90, NC-100, or NC-150.    
 
All regulations of the underlying zoning district shall apply to property within the Conservation Overlay 
District except where modified by this designation. 
 
Tracts or sites within a COD shall be identified on the official zoning map and in other official writings by 
the letters "COD". 

 
518.02. Designation Procedure.  The City of Auburn may designate tracts or sites for inclusion within a 
Conservation Overlay District in the manner prescribed in Article IX, Section 906 of the City of Auburn 
Zoning Ordinance. 

 
518.03. Designation Criteria. When determining the potential for Conservation Overlay District 
designation, the Planning Commission and City Council shall ensure that at least one of the following criteria 
are satisfied: 
 

(1)    District designation conforms to City plans and policies;  
(2) Evidence that a Conservation Overlay District designation would be an appropriate and 

effective method for conserving the area’s natural resources while preserving water quality. 
 

518.04. Rezoning of Property in the Lake Ogletree Subwatershed.  After the effective date of this section 
of the ordinance, property in the Lake Ogletree Subwatershed, as identified on the City of Auburn Watershed 
Map (adopted on December 5, 2006), shall be rezoned only as Rural, LLRD, LDD, NC-11, NC-12, NC-14, 
NC-15, NC-18, NC-20, NC-26, NC-32, NC-35, NC-39, NC-48, NC-50, NC-54, NC-84, NC-90, NC-100, 
and NC-150.   
 
518.05. Minimum Tract Size for a COD Subdivision.  The minimum land area for a conservation 
subdivision is ten (10) contiguous acres.  The Planning Commission and City Council may consider smaller 
parcels, greater than or equal to five acres, if the applicant can demonstrate one of the following: (1) the 
proposed Open Space provides a connection between unconnected existing open space, greenspace, or other 
protected natural resource areas and will not result in isolated fragments of open space; or (2) the proposed 
Conservation Subdivision would ensure a unique natural or historically significant area will be protected.   
 
518.06. Permitted Uses in the Conservation Overlay District.  Any uses permitted by right in the 
underlying zoning district shall be permitted in the COD.  Land allocated as primary and secondary 
conservation areas and designated as permanent open space are subject to the requirements found in Article 
VI of the City of Auburn Subdivision Regulations.  Where conditional use approval is required, such 
approval must be granted prior to the approval of a final plat. 
  
518.07. Minimum Open Space for a COD Subdivision: Open Space shall comprise a minimum of fifty 
(50) percent of the gross area of a conservation subdivision.  See Article VI of the City of Auburn Subdivision 
Regulations for standards for Open Space. 
 
518.08. Maximum Impervious Surface Ratio for the COD.  See City of Auburn Subdivision Regulations, 
Article VI. 

 
518.09. Density Requirements in the District.  The maximum number of lots allowed in a conservation 
subdivision shall be determined by the density of the underlying zoning district or by dividing the total area 

V-86



 
 

of the proposed conservation subdivision by the minimum lot size allowed for a subdivision within the 
planning jurisdiction or the subwatershed as set forth in Section 518.10.   
 
The maximum density for property zoned as Limited Development District (LDD) within the Lake Ogletree 
Subwatershed shall be based on conventional residential standards as set forth on Table 4-2. 
 
518.10. Minimum Lot Size.  The minimum lot size in any COD zone is as follows: 

   
Within Lake Ogletree Subwatershed: 
 Option 1:  Conservation Subdivision  
  Minimum lot size for lots without sewer--- 1.5 acres 
  Minimum lot size for lots with sewer --- 10,890 square feet 
  

 Option 2:  Conventional Subdivision 
  Minimum lot size for lots without sewer-- 3 acres 

Minimum lot size for lots with sewer --- Same as the minimum lot size specified for the 
underlying zoning district. 

  
Outside Lake Ogletree Subwatershed: 
  

There is no minimum lot size requirement outside the watershed area.  The density allowed by the 
underlying zoning district or specified in these regulations limits the maximum site density.  
 

518.11. Subdivision Plat Submission Requirements.  All conservation subdivisions must conform to the 
requirements set forth in the City of Auburn Subdivision Regulations.

ARTICLE VI.  SIGNS. 

Section 601.  Purpose and Scope. 

601.01. It is the purpose of this Article to establish regulations for the control of all signs within the City of 
Auburn.  The intent of this Article is to support and promote the use of signs to aid the public in the 
identification of businesses and other activities, to assist the public in its orientation within the City, to express 
the history and character of the City, to promote the community’s ability to attract sources of economic 
development and growth, and to serve other informational purposes.  Further, it is the intent of this Article 
to protect the public from the confusion created by the objectionable effects of advertising excesses, from the 
danger of unsafe signs, and from the degradation of the aesthetic qualities of the City.  This Article is not 
intended to inhibit an individual’s right to express non-commercial messages protected by the First 
Amendment of the United States Constitution. 

601.02. These regulations shall apply to all signs erected, constructed, displayed, painted, maintained, 
altered, and/or installed in every zoning district in the City, which are designed or intended to be seen by or 
attract the attention of the public.  No sign shall be erected or installed unless it is in compliance with the 
regulations of this Article.

Redevelopment Districts – East (CRD-E) and West (CRD-W) east of North Donahue 
Drive.  Existing freestanding signs, at the time of adoption of this ordinance (04/02/2019), 
are allowed to remain in the Urban Core (UC), Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and 
UN-S) districts, and Corridor Redevelopment Districts – East (CRD-E) and West (CRD-
W), east of North Donahue Drive.  However, should any changes be made or are requested 
to be made to the existing sign, the sign must meet the following requirements.  
Freestanding signs in the Urban Core (UC), Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-
S), and Corridor Redevelopment Districts – East (CRD-E) and West (CRD-W) east of 
North Donahue Drive districts are limited to an area of 32 square feet and shall not exceed 
eight (8) feet in height.  All structural elements of the sign must be covered entirely with 
materials that correspond to the building materials and to the materials listed in the Urban 
Core District Development and Design Standards (See Section 507.02), such as but not 
limited to brick, limestone, or stucco.  In addition, freestanding signs in the UN Districts 
and CRD-E and W (east of North Donahue Drive) shall meet the requirements of Section 
429. Such signs shall have a minimum setback of ten (10) feet from any side lot line and 
ten (10) feet from the front or any street property line.  No portion of a freestanding sign 
shall project into the public right-of-way.  

 
605.02. Menu Boards.  A permanent sign, which is not designed or located so as to be legible from any 
public right-of-way, depicting products that can be purchased on the property for which it is located (i.e. fast 
food restaurants) and is part of a drive-through service.  Menu boards must be noted on the sign permit, but 
the size does not count against the allowable square footage of a freestanding sign. 
 
605.03. Subdivision Identification Marker.  A sign marking an entrance from a perimeter road to a 
residential subdivision, office park, or industrial park. Subdivision markers may be a single sign or a pair of 
signs. A subdivision marker shall contain no advertising other than the name of the residential subdivision, 
office park, or industrial park.  No subdivision marker shall be located within the public right of way and 
must be within the perimeter of the subdivision.  If such sign is to be placed within a dedicated drainage or 
utility easement, a hold harmless agreement must be sought from the City Engineer and/or the Water 
Resource Management Director, prior to the issuance of a sign permit.  Size shall be limited to 100 square 
feet in total display area at each entrance from a perimeter road and shall be ground-mounted or monument 
style. 
 

VI-11



 

605.04. Building Signs.   Building signs on any single development site shall not exceed a total of two (2) 
square feet per linear foot of the main or entry facade.  Multi-story structures with outside entrances to 
businesses on each floor may multiply the allowable building signage area by the number of floors.  Multi-
story buildings with interior entrances and hotel/motel businesses are not allowed to apply the multiplier.  
Building signs on development sites located in the Urban Core (UC), the College Edge Overlay (CEOD), 
and the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) districts, shall be governed by the regulations listed 
below.  Building signs on development sites located in the Corridor Redevelopment District – West (CRD-
W), east of North Donahue Drive, shall be governed under the regulations set forth in Section 510.  Prorating 
of allowable building signage amongst building tenants shall be the responsibility of the owner or property 
manager, not the Auburn Planning Department. 
 

A. Building Signs in the Urban Core, College Edge Overlay District, and Urban 
Neighborhood Districts. Building signs and sandwich board signs as defined in Article 
VI are the only signs that are allowed in the UC, CEOD, and UN districts. Signs may be 
attached to any building façade.  In a multi-tenant building, the building owner is 
responsible for distributing the sign allowance among the tenants. 
 
Electronic reader boards are prohibited in the UC, CEOD, CRD-W, and UN districts.   
 
Single story building – Each building facade that faces a public street or that has the main 
entrance may have one (1) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building or 
space width, or sixteen (16) square feet, whichever is greater, but no more than fifty (50) 
square feet. Other building facades may have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for 
each (1) linear foot of building width, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. 
 
Multi-story building – Each building facade that faces a public street or that has the main 
entrance may have two (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building or 
space width or thirty-two (32) square feet, whichever is greater, but no more than seventy-
five (75) square feet. Other building facades may have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign 
area for each (1) linear foot of building width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square 
feet. Ground story nonresidential uses may have allowable signage area independent from 
that allowed for the multi-story building. Such uses with facades that face a public street 
may have two (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot of bay or thirty-two (32) 
feet, whichever is greater, but no more than seventy-five (75) feet. 
 
Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square feet can be 
provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade that has a sidewalk or 
entrance.  A blade mounted sign is defined as an ornamental rod extending perpendicular 
from the building with a hanging sign suspended from it at a 90-degree angle from building 
face and street ROW. Blade signs are to be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above 
sidewalk level to the bottom of the blade sign.  Text and graphics on either or both ends of 
an awning that are oriented perpendicular to the building face for pedestrian view and are 
no more than six (6) square feet may be provided in lieu of a blade sign. 
 
All building signs must be mounted between the first and second story line, or between the 
second and third story line or near the top of the wall.  The Planning Director, or appropriate 
designee, may approve an alternate location for a sign in cases where these locations 
conflict with or may cause damage to architectural ornamentation of a building.  In any 
case, building signs may not be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the 
primary sign is computed by measuring the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle, 
within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed. Text and 
graphics on the front of an awning oriented parallel to the building face are allowed and 
are considered building signage. 
 
A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for placement on the 
sidewalk in front of the place of business being advertised, and is generally two (2) sided.  

VI-12



 

Sandwich board signs that meet all of the following criteria may be placed and displayed 
on a public sidewalk: 
 
1. A height of no more than four (4) feet; 
2. Maximum area of any side is eight (8) square feet; 
3. No illumination; 
4. Placed in front of the building or leased space during business hours respective to 

the use in the building or leased space; 
5. Maintains a clearance on the sidewalk of at least five (5) feet; and, 
6. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other sandwich board 

sign.   
 
Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side make it impossible 
for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich board spacing requirement, the 
Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternative location that 
maximizes distance between adjacent signs. 

 
B. Building Signs in all other zoning districts. Building signs on any single development 

site shall not exceed a total of two (2) square feet per linear foot of the main or entry facade. 
Multi-story structures with outside entrances to businesses on each floor may multiply the 
allowable building signage area by the number of floors. Multistory buildings with interior 
entrances and hotel/motel businesses are not allowed to apply the multiplier. Prorating of 
allowable building signage amongst building tenants shall be the responsibility of the 
owner or property manager, not the Auburn Planning Department. 

 
605.05. Multi-Family Residential Signs.  Permits are required for all signs located on multi-family 
residential properties whether on a single lot or on multiple lots under the same ownership and/or 
management and/or development name.  The following requirements apply to multi-family residential sites: 
 

A. Wall Sign - 32 square feet; or, 
 
B. Freestanding Sign - 32 square feet. 
 
C. One sign of either type is allowed at each entrance from a public street or perimeter road. 

 
605.06. Banners.  Banners, as defined in this Article, require a permit prior to display, (See Section 608.02).   
 
Section 606.  Master Signage Plan. 
 
606.01. Purpose and Intent.  The purpose of this section is to offer incentives to sign users particularly on 

larger sites or groups of sites to plan and design signs that are compatible with the buildings on the 
site thus enhancing the appearance of the site and of the streetscape that includes it.  This section 
sets out specific criteria for review and incentives for compliance.  Consideration of design issues 
necessarily requires some exercise of judgment within the specific criteria set out in this section, but 
decisions rendered by utilizing these review criteria shall be objective. 

 
606.02. Applicability.  A Master Signage Plan may be submitted for any shopping center, multi-tenant 

commercial/retail development, business park, industrial park, or mixed-use development located 
in any of the following zoning districts:  South College Corridor District (SCCD), Corridor 
Redevelopment District (CRD-U and CRD-S), Comprehensive Development District (CDD), 
Limited Development District (LDD)*, and the Planned Development District (PDD). 

 
* Neighborhood Shopping Centers Only 

 
 

VI-13



 

606.03. Procedure.  All Master Signage Plans shall be processed in accordance with the following

conforms to all requirements of this section in effect at the time of submittal.  Any such amendment 
shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. 

 
606.06. Provisions for Nonconforming Signs.  A Master Signage Plan for a property already containing 

signs on the date of submission of the application shall include a schedule for bringing all signs on 
the development site into conformance with the Master Signage Plan by a specified date.  The 
conformance schedule included in such Master Signage Plan shall be considered a condition of 
approval of the Master Signage Plan. 

 
606.07. Incentives.  To encourage the use of Master Signage Plans, and thus to improve the appearance of 

signage within individual projects, the following incentives which involve deviations from the 
regulations that would otherwise apply in Article VI of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply: 

 

VI-14



 

A. The area shown on the Master Signage Plan shall all be considered on-premises for 
purposes of determining whether a sign is off-premises; 

 
B. The sign size and area for any freestanding sign (other than monument signs) may be 

increased to 120% of the sign size and area that would otherwise be allowed in accordance 
with Article VI; 

C. The sign size and area for any monument sign may be increased to 130% of the sign size 
and area that would otherwise be allowed in accordance with Article VI. 

 
Section 607.  Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Signs. 
 
607.01. Compliance with Building and Electrical Code Requirements.  All permanent signs and the 
illumination thereof, shall be designed, constructed and maintained in conformity with the applicable 
provisions of the International Building Code adopted by the City of Auburn.  All freestanding signs must 
have a clearance from the Building and Codes Inspection Division prior to the issuance of a sign permit by 
the Planning Department.  Wherever there is inconsistency between this Ordinance and the building or 
electrical code, the more restrictive requirement shall apply. 
 
607.02. Illumination Standards.  
 

A. Sign lighting shall not be designed or located to cause confusion with traffic signal or 
similar warning signs. 

 
B. Devices that illuminate a sign or signs shall be placed and shielded so that direct light shall 

not be cast into the eyes of pedestrians, cyclists or motorists entering or using a street, road 
or highway. 

 
C. The illumination of signs shall comply with the lighting standards as set forth in the 

International Building Code adopted by the City. 
 
607.03. Placement and Clearance Standards. 
 

A. No freestanding sign shall project into a public right-of-way.  All freestanding signs shall 
be setback at least ten (10) feet from all side lot lines and any lot line adjacent to a public 
right-of-way. 

 
B. No freestanding sign shall be located in a public drainage or utility easement without 

written permission, in the form of a hold harmless agreement, from the City Engineer 
and/or the Water Resource Management Director prior to the issuance of a sign permit. 

 
Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a roadway, the 
display area shall be the area of one sign face.  Where a sign has two (2) or more faces that can be viewed 
from a single location or has an angle greater that 45 degrees, the display area of all such faces shall be 
included in determining the total display area of the sign. 
 
607.04. Calculation of Display Area.  The display area of a sign or advertising device is measured by the 
smallest square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the entire sign or 
advertising device; excluding trim, frame, apron, posts, uprights, braces or other structural members which 
support it.  
 
Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a roadway, the 
display area shall be the area of one sign face.  Where a sign has two (2) or more faces that can be viewed 
from a single location, the display area of all such faces shall be included in determining the total display 
area of the sign. 
 

VI-15



 

Open-lettered sign display area shall be measured by the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle, 
within which all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed, multiplied by a factor 
of 0.8. 
 
When a sign is in the form of a three-dimensional object, the area shall be determined by drawing a square, 
rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the projected image of the sign and 
multiplying that area by two (2).  The “projected image” is that image created by tracing the largest possible 
two-dimensional outline of the sign. 
 
607.05. Relationship to Building Features. 

 
A. Signs mounted to the structural roof or applied to the roof including painted signs are 

prohibited.  
 
B. Window signs are exempt. 
 
C. Interior signs displayed in a manner that they are visible from a public right-of-way or 

adjoining properties are prohibited.  (See also Window Signs). 
 

607.06. Maintenance.  All signs, including their supports, braces, guys and anchors, electrical parts and 
lighting fixtures, and all painted and display areas, shall be maintained in accordance with the International 
Building Code adopted by the City of Auburn.  All signs and their components shall be maintained in good 
repair, free of rust, peeling, fading, broken or cracked panels, and broken or missing letters.  Vegetation must 
be properly maintained and no condition shall be allowed that would constitute a fire, safety, or health hazard. 
 
607.07. Abandoned Signs. 
 

A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, any sign or sign structure identifying a 
previous use or activity that has not occupied the site for a period greater than sixty (60)

which no longer applies, shall be deemed abandoned.  Any abandoned sign shall be 
prohibited and shall be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner of the property 
within 60 days.  The removal of a frame of an abandoned sign shall not be required, if it 
conforms to all applicable terms contained in these regulations (including the sign face area 
for sign replacement yielded by such frame). 

 
B. Any sign structure, which supported or supports an abandoned sign and which structure 

conforms to all applicable terms contained in these regulations shall be allowed to remain 
in place. However, in the event a sign structure which supported or supports an abandoned 
sign is inconsistent with any term contained in these regulations (including the sign face 
area for sign replacement yielded by the frame), then the sign structure and frame shall be 
either altered to comply with the terms contained herein or removed by the owner of such 
structure or property. 

 
Section 608.  Permitting and Enforcement/Administration. 
 
608.01. Permits for Permanent Signs.  
 

A. Applicability.  No person shall erect, alter, relocate, repair, replace the face of, or change 
a sign without first obtaining a permit, except for the following actions which shall not 
require a permit:

4. An application may be amended within thirty (30) days of the application date to 

include additional signs.  Additional fees shall be charged if the additional signs 
exceed the size limitations for fee category.  After thirty (30) days, a new sign 
permit shall be required for any sign constructed and all fees shall be required.  

 
5.   Freestanding signs will require a footing inspection by the Building and Codes 

Inspection Division unless such inspection is specifically waived by an Inspector.  
 
6. Failure to obtain a permit prior to installing, changing, or erecting a sign shall 

result in the doubling of the permit fee. 
 

C. Submission Requirements.  No request for a sign permit shall be considered complete

VI-18



ARTICLE VII.  NONCONFORMITIES. 

Section 700.  Purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of legal uses, structures, lots, 
and signs established either prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or the effective date of future amendments to this 
Ordinance that no longer conform to the requirements of this Ordinance. All such situations are collectively referred to as 
"nonconformities." 

The zoning regulations established by this Ordinance are designed to guide the future use of land in the City of Auburn 
by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses, and thus, to promote and protect the public health, 
safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for 
which such regulations are established, and thus, the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable. 
With limited exceptions, the regulations of this article permit such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation 
of time, but are intended to restrict further investments which would make them more permanent. 

While nonconformities may continue, the provisions of this chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in 
nonconformities to bring about their eventual improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this 
Ordinance and the character of the City. Any nonconforming use, structure, lot, or sign that lawfully existed as of the 
effective date of this Ordinance and that remains nonconforming, and any use, structure, lot, or sign that becomes 
nonconforming as a result of any subsequent rezoning or amendment to the text of this Ordinance, may be continued or 
maintained only in accordance with the terms of this chapter. This chapter also is intended to reduce vacancies, promote 
appropriate redevelopment and reuse of existing structures and lots, and set forth requirements. 

This Article distinguishes nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures, nonconforming development sites, 
nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming manufactured home parks, and nonconforming signs.  Different regulations 
are made applicable to each of these categories.  The degree of restriction made applicable to each separate category is a 
function of the degree to which that category of nonconformity is a nuisance or incompatible with the purposes and 
regulations of this Ordinance. 

Section 701.  Definitions. 

701.01. A legal nonconformity is any land use or physical design of development, structure, sign, or lot of record legally 
established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, which would not be permitted by 
or is not in full compliance with the regulations of this Ordinance. 

701.02. A nonconforming use is an activity using land, buildings, and/or structures for purposes which were legally 
established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, and which would not be permitted 
to be established as a new use in a zone in which it is located by the regulations of this Ordinance. Once changed to a 
conforming use, no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. 

701.03. A nonconforming structure is any building or structure, other than a sign, legally established prior to the 
effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, which does not fully comply with the standards of this 
Ordinance. 

701.04. A nonconforming development site is any development site, legally established prior to the effective date of this 
Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it and part of an approved site plan or subdivision plat at the time of its 
establishment, which does not fully comply with the standards of this Ordinance, including the minimum acceptable 
bufferyard requirements of Section 714.  Noncompliance with the bufferyard requirements of Section 420 through 
Section 432 requires compliance with Section 714, but does not render a development site nonconforming. 

701.05. A nonconforming lot of record is any validly recorded lot meeting the requirements of § 711.03 of the Zoning 
Ordinance, which at the time it was recorded fully, complied with all applicable laws and ordinances, but which does not 
fully comply with the lot requirements of this Ordinance concerning minimum area, minimum lot width, or minimum 
street frontage. 

VII-1



 
 

701.06. A nonconforming sign is any sign legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent 
amendment to it which does not fully comply with all requirements of Article VI of this Ordinance. 
 
Section 702.  Determination of Nonconforming Status.   
 
702.01. The burden of establishing the nonconforming status of any structure or land use under the terms of this Article, 
in all cases, shall be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not upon the City of Auburn. 
 
702.02. Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of an existing nonconformity are permitted but such 
nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
 
702.03. This chapter shall not apply, however, to any development standard or feature that is the subject of a variance or 
waiver granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, Historic Preservation Commission, Planning Commission, or City 
Council. Where a variance or waiver has been granted for a development standard that does not otherwise conform to the 
requirements of this Ordinance, that development standard shall be deemed conforming. 
 
Section 703.  Termination of Nonconforming Status. 
 
703.01.  In the event that any structure containing a nonconforming use, nonconforming structure, nonconforming 
development site, or nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of 
its fair market value at the time of loss, as determined by the Lee County Tax Assessor or licensed appraiser, such 
structure shall not be rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any purpose unless the structure and its development site shall 
thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance.  When such a nonconforming structure or development site is 
damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50 percent or less of its fair market value at the time of loss, no repairs or 
rebuilding shall be permitted except in conformity with this Article and other applicable regulations of this Ordinance.  
Such restoration shall be undertaken only under a valid building permit for which a complete application is submitted 
within 18 months following said damage, which permit must be actively pursued to completion. 
 
703.02. In the event that any nonconforming use, structure containing a nonconforming use, or nonconforming structure, 
is proposed to be  physically expanded or modified through a change in character, operation, or scale to the extent of 
more than 50 percent of its fair market value, as determined by the Lee County Tax Assessor or licensed appraiser, such 
structure shall not be physically expanded or modified through a change in character, operation, or scale for any purpose 
unless the structure and its development site shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. 
 
703.03. Any other provision of this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, no use or structure which is accessory to a 
principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or 
terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. For purposes of this paragraph, 
“ceased” or “terminated” shall mean that regular use or occupation of a structure has not occurred for more than twelve 
(12) consecutive months. 
 
Section 704.  Review Process. 
 
704.01 Continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a nonconforming 
use are permitted as defined in Section 705. 
 
704.02. The reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or nonconforming site that houses a conforming use, 
and that meets the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03, shall use the permitted use in nonconforming structures 
process in Section 706. 
 
704.03. Enlargement, expansion, alteration or major repair of a nonconforming structure or a conforming structure on a 
nonconforming site when such structure houses a nonconforming use, or when such structure houses a conforming use 
shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in 
Section 707 and Section 714 of this Ordinance and also the requirements of this section.  Enlargements, expansions, 
alterations and major repairs are all of those actions that do not meet the provisions of Section 705 or Section 706. 
 

VII-2



 
 

704.04. Enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval 
in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in Section 708 of this Ordinance and also the requirements of 
this section. 
 
704.05. Site Plans 
 
Site plans may be required for activities falling under the provisions of Section 704.2.  Site plans shall be required for 
activities falling under the provisions of Section 704.03 and Section 704.04 
 
Section 705.  Continuation, Maintenance, and Minor Repair. 
 
705.01. The continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a 
nonconforming use are permitted, provided that the continuation, maintenance, or minor repair does not extend or expand 
the nonconforming use or structure, except in accordance with Section 705. For the purposes of this section, 
"maintenance or minor repair" shall mean: 

 
A. Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness 

or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure; 
 

B. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land 
uses; and  

 
C. Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety as determined by 

the Codes Enforcement division (does not apply to damage or destruction governed by Section 703.01). 
 

C. Incidental alterations (see Section 203), including: 
a. Internal reconfigurations of an existing building that do not meet the definition of an alteration 

(alterations must be approved through Section 707);  
 

b. Limited modifications to an existing building façade, such as recladding or repainting 
 
c. Addition or substitution of an awning or awnings; 

 
d. Modifications or additions to approved landscaping; 

 
705.02. In the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a 
period of twelve (12) months or more, or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure 
or premises is located, the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such 
structure or premise is located. 
 
Section 706.  Permitted Uses in Nonconforming Structures.   
 
706.01. The reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or conforming structure on a nonconforming site shall 
not be required to acquire conditional use approval or undergo the typical DRT review procedure if the eligibility 
requirements of Section 706.03 below are met. Owners of such properties may be issued a zoning certificate after staff 
review of the proposed reuse or redevelopment. Reuse and redevelopment that does not qualify for consideration under 
this section may instead utilize the process in Section 707 for review and approval. 
 
706.02. Intent. 
 
The intent of this process is to encourage the utilization of existing nonconforming buildings and sites as opposed to their 
remaining vacant while at the same time reducing such nonconformities to the extent practical. The process allows 
owners to make improvements to an existing structure or site without having to go through a lengthy review process, 
produce a detailed site plan, reach compliance with all provisions of this Ordinance, or make roadway improvements. 
 
 

VII-3



 
 

706.03 Eligibility Requirements 
 
To qualify for issuance of a zoning certificate under Section 706, the following conditions must exist: 

1. The proposed use is permitted within the zoning district. 
2. The redeveloped use will occupy an existing building(s) on the site, with no expansions or additions proposed. 
3. The site will add no more than 1,000 square feet of additional impervious surface. 
4. The proposed new use does not expand existing encroachments into required buffers. 
5. The site will be in compliance with the provisions of Article VI, Signs. 
 

706.04 Limitations 
 
Proposals which do not meet the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03 are required to undergo the normal DRT 
review process and/or the conditional use process in cases of expansion or major alteration. 
 
Proposals for nonconforming sites or structures that have been vacant for less than twelve (12) months and do not 
involve, either proposed or required, any changes to the site or exterior of the structure (changes listed under Section 705 
are exempted) shall be reviewed during the zoning certificate issuance process for compliance with the approved site plan 
or ordinance requirements in effect at the time it was established. If one (1) or more aspects of the site and/or structure 
fail to comply with the applicable plan approval or ordinance requirements, the deficiencies shall be corrected and the 
Planning Director must verify compliance prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
 
Proposals involving a change in use that, although may be permitted within the underlying zoning district, will increase 
the intensity of the use(s) originally approved, will be required to demonstrate compliance with the current Ordinance 
requirements applicable to the proposed change prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate and/or certificate of 
occupancy. Demonstrating compliance can be accomplished either through the site plan review or Section 706 process, 
whichever is applicable.  

 
706.05. Plan Submittal Requirements 
 
Issuance of a zoning certificate under this section may require submission of the following information, upon request of 
staff: 

1. Landscaping and/or fencing compliant with Section 714, Minimum Acceptable Bufferyards; and 
2. Off-street parking/parking lot design (dimensional standards and standard specifications); and 
3. Screening of dumpsters, storage, heating and air conditioning, and similar equipment; and 
4. Building improvements (painting or other changes); and 
5. Access roads and entrances or exit drives to ensure automotive and pedestrian safety and traffic flow; and 

 
706.06. Conditions 
 
The Planning Director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time 
limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the 
nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and 
the general public. 
 
706.07. Exceptions for Required Improvements 
 
The Director of Planning and/or the Engineering Services Director may waive, in part or in full, certain required 
improvements if meeting them is deemed impractical or unreasonable given the constraints on the existing site. 
Consideration may also be given to the extent of the required improvements in relation to the specific nature and scope of 
the reuse/redevelopment proposal. 

 
Section 707.  Administrative Review and Approval.   
 
Enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconforming structure, use or site shall require administrative 
site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section. 
 

VII-4



 
 

707.01. Site plans as required in Section 704.05 shall be submitted for review by the Planning Director or his designee.  
Site plans must meet the requirements of Section 802.12 of this Ordinance. The Planning Director or his designee shall 
determine whether to approve the proposed enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair. The Planning Director or 
his designee shall not approve the proposed activity unless and until it is found, based on the submitted site plan, that the 
proposed enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair meets the standards of review set forth in Section 802.05, 
Review Procedures, of this Ordinance, as well as the following: 
 

1. The nonconforming use allowed to continue remains compatible with adjacent land uses and the Future Land 
Use Plan; 

2. That all access roads and entrance or exit drives to the nonconformity will be adequate with respect to 
automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control and access in the case of fire or 
other emergency; 

3. That all off-street parking, loading, refuse collection, and other service areas will be adequate with respect to 
automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and economic, noise, glare, odor, and other 
impacts on adjoining properties; 

4. That all water, wastewater treatment, schools, fire and police protection, and other necessary public and private 
utilities and services will be adequate with respect to their location, availability, and compatibility with 
adjoining properties; 

5. That all landscaping, screening, and fencing will be adequate, with respect to the effectiveness of their type, 
dimensions, and character, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the economic, noise, glare, odor, and 
other impacts of the nonconformity on adjoining properties and other properties in the neighborhood; 

6. That the type, size, and intensity of the proposed use, including such considerations as storage of items and 
arrangement, the size of the site and the location of the use upon it, and the hours of operation and numbers of 
people who are likely to utilize or be attached to the use, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the impact 
of the nonconformity upon adjoining properties, other properties in the neighborhood, and the purposes of the 
zoning district in which the property is located; and 

7. Surface drainage will be adequate with respect to on-site and off-site erosion, siltation, pollution, flooding, or 
other detrimental effects of the nonconformity. 

 
707.02. Other Considerations 
 
In determining whether the proposed extension, alteration, or major repair will substantially injure the use and enjoyment 
of other properties, the Planning Director or his designee shall also consider and balance: 
 

1. The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the nonconformity resulting from denying the approval, from 
approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or 
from approving the request; 

2. The possible detriment or benefit to the owners of nearby properties resulting from denying the approval, from 
approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or 
from approving the request; and 

3. The possible detriment or benefit to the general public resulting from denying the approval, from approving the 
request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving 
the request. 

 
707.03. Conditions  
 
The Planning Director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time 
limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the 
nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and 
the general public. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

VII-5



 
 

707.04. Limits on Expansion 
 
If the Planning Director or his designee permits a nonconforming structure or use to expand, then the following shall 
apply: 
 

1. The area of such expansion shall not exceed 25 percent of the area of the existing nonconforming use or 
structure, unless otherwise allowable in this Section; 

2. Telecommunications towers may be expanded by more than 25 percent to permit the co-location of a second or 
subsequent user or communications sending or receiving device so that the need for an additional tower is 
eliminated. Only the City Council may permit the expansion of a non-conforming telecommunications  tower in 
districts in which it is not a permitted use.  
 

707.05 Limits on Requirements 
 
In acting upon applications submitted under Section 707, the Planning Director or his designee shall not order the 
discontinuation or termination of nonconformity. If an application is denied, then the continuation, maintenance, and 
minor repair of the nonconformity shall still be allowed in accordance with the terms of this Article. 
 
Section 708.  Enlargement or Expansion of Conditional Uses.   
 
Enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval in 
accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section. 
 
708.01. Process for Approval 
 
The process for conditional use approval shall be in two parts: 

1. Approval of the conditional use shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 803 of this Ordinance, 
requiring Planning Commission review and City Council approval. 

2. Approval of the enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconforming structure, use or site 
shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set 
forth Section 707 

 
Section 709. Exceptions for Residential Setbacks 
 
Certain additions to existing, nonconforming single-, two-, three-, or multi-family or townhouse dwellings may extend 
into a required front, side, or rear yard setback when the existing dwelling is already legally nonconforming with respect 
to that setback. The nonconforming portion shall be at least 60 percent of the total width of the respective wall of the 
structure prior to the addition. Additions may extend up to the height limit of the zoning district and extend into the 
required front, side and/or rear yard setback as follows: 
 

1. Front and rear yard setbacks: The addition may extend five feet into the required front or rear yard setback or to 
the extent of the setback line formed by the nonconforming portion, whichever is less.  

2. Side yard setbacks: The addition may extend into the required side yard setback up to the setback line formed 
by the nonconforming wall, except in no case shall the addition be closer than 5 feet from the side property line. 
Furthermore, the size of the addition shall be limited to an additional wall surface area within the required side 
setback area of no more than 200 square feet. 

 
Section 710. Exceptions for Historic Resources 
  
In an effort to promote and encourage the preservation and adaptive reuse of locally designated resources, the Planning 
Director or his designee may grant certain waivers to the zoning code provided that it will result in the preservation of a 
locally designated property, after review and approval by the Historic Preservation Commission. The Planning Director, 
or his designee, may authorize certain waivers to the requirements of the underlying zoning district, to the extent 
indicated herein.  
 

VII-6



 
 

1. Any building that is individually locally designated or is classified as a contributing building within a local 
historic district, as identified in the contributing resources report, shall be permitted to be repaired, restored, 
structurally altered, or reconstructed, notwithstanding any conflicts with provisions of the underlying zoning 
district requirements pertaining to minimum lot size, setbacks, minimum lot width, FAR, open space, off-street 
parking or loading requirements. In cases where the configuration of a locally designated property, or a 
contributing property within a locally designated historic district precludes reasonable and appropriate use of 
the property within the underlying zoning district a waiver of up to twenty percent (20%) from the underlying 
requirements for setbacks, FAR, and open space may be authorized by the Planning Director or his designee.  

2. Any contributing historic resource or building will not be limited to the valuation clause for nonconformities.  
3. In cases where the size or configuration of a locally designated property, or a contributing property within a 

locally designated historic district is such that compliance with off-street parking requirements would destroy 
the historic character of the property, the Planning Director or his designee may authorize a reduction of up to 
one hundred percent (100%) of the number of parking spaces that would ordinarily be required for a new 
structure of equivalent use and floor area. Such a reduction will be granted only when it can be demonstrated 
that: 

 
a. Granting the modification will further the preservation of the historic and architectural character of the 

historic resource, or of the historic district in which the proposal is located.  
b. Granting the modification would promote the preservation of the historic resource or historic district 

while reducing nonconformities. 
c. Granting the modification would help minimize or mitigate any potential adverse effect of a specific 

proposal whose implementation promotes the preservation of the historic resource or historic district.  
d. Special circumstances exist such as adjacencies or shared parking that will practically alleviate 

concerns for off-street parking.  
 
The Planning Director, or his designee, shall make specific findings that establish how the criteria have been met. 
Additionally, staff may impose any conditions, restrictions, or limitations deemed appropriate in order to ensure 
compliance with the criteria set forth above. 
 
Section 711.  Nonconforming Lots of Record.  
 
711.01. Subject to the provisions of this Section, a nonconforming lot of record may be used for any principal use 
permitted or conditional, provided approval from City Council, in the zone in which the lot is located, provided that for 
any use which is to be served by an individual well and/or septic system, the nonconforming lot shall be of a size and 
design to meet the minimum requirements of the Lee County Health Department regulations for such wells and septic 
systems. 
 
711.02. Performance residential developments shall be prohibited on development sites smaller than the minimum sizes 
established in Section 502.02.  If permitted in the applicable zoning district, single family dwelling units may be 
constructed on nonconforming lots of record at least 4,000 square feet in size and 50 feet in width.  Adjoining lots, which 
are combined to form one (1) parcel shall be considered to meet this standard.  
 
711.03. Minimum lot sizes for nonresidential uses are established in Table 4-3. To qualify as a nonconforming lot of 
record under this section, lots must have been platted prior to or in the year 1984 or be smaller than the following sizes: 
 

Rural District (R)     40,000 s.f. 
Industrial District (I)    10,000 s.f. 
Other Districts1     7,500 s.f. 
 

In addition to the requirements of the previous sentence, a nonconforming lot must be have fully complied with all 
applicable laws and ordinances at the time it was recorded, but currently does not fully comply with the lot requirements 
of this Ordinance concerning minimum area, minimum lot width, or minimum street frontage. Where a lot meets the 
required minimum size for the district but not for a particular use category as specified in Table 4-3 (i.e., road service use 
                     
     1However, no minimum lot size is required in the Urban Core (UC) District. 

VII-7



 
 

requires 30,000 s.f.) it shall not be considered a nonconforming lot of record.  The lot shall instead be used for another 
development type for which it is eligible, based on its size. 
 
Property which qualifies as a nonconforming lot of record under this Section shall be eligible for any land use category 
having a minimum size requirement of 40,000 s.f. in the Rural (R) district, 10,000 square feet in the Industrial (I) district, 
and 7,500 s.f. in all others, as established in Table 4-3.   
 
711.04. No nonresidential use(s) shall be permitted on nonconforming lots of record less than 6,000 square feet in size 
and 60 feet in width unless the Board of Zoning Adjustment grants a variance. Variances granted under this section shall 
not be use specific but rather granted for the required lot size and width for a particular use. 
 
Section 712. Nonconforming Uses  
 
In the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a one (1) year 
period or more, or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure or premises is located, 
the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such structure or premise is located. 
 
712.01. Change of Use 
 
Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use by securing all approvals and permits that this Ordinance 
requires for the intended or resulting use. No nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use. 
 
Section 713. Manufactured Home Parks  
 
713.01. Existing manufactured home parks, which are nonconforming by use, shall not be redesigned, expanded in area, 
or modified to accommodate additional manufactured homes.  
 
713.02. Manufactured home parks which are properly zoned and which are nonconforming by design only may be 
expanded in area and/or modified so as to reduce or eliminate those aspects of design, which render it nonconforming.  
The Planning Commission may authorize additional manufactured home sites in such parks upon submission of a site 
plan, consistent with the standards of Section 802, showing a redesign of the park, which substantiates the following: 
 

A. The overall density of the park will not exceed seven (7) units per acre.   
 
B. A 20-foot wide residential buffer shall be provided along all development site boundaries (See Section 

426.03, Residential Buffer Landscaping Requirements). 
 
C. No new manufactured home will be placed within 20 feet of any property line. 
 
D. Where possible, all development standards of Section 502.02(G) have been met, or the degree of 

nonconformity reduced.  In no case shall the degree of nonconformity of any design aspect be 
increased. 

 
A redesign proposal that does not include the addition of new manufactured home spaces shall not be subject to 
conditions A and B above.  Any redesign proposal shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. 
 
713.03. The replacement of an existing manufactured home shall be allowed, provided that such replacement does not 
increase any degree of existing nonconformity (e.g. setbacks). 
 

VII-8



 
 

Section 714.  Minimum Acceptable Bufferyard.  
 
Subsequent to the discontinuance of a nonconforming use, a development site, which is nonconforming by physical 
design, may be utilized for any activity or use which is otherwise permitted by this Ordinance.  However, as a condition 
of approval of any enlargement, reconfiguration or any type of new development on the site, certain improvements must 
be made pursuant to this Section.  When nonconformity is a result of noncompliance with the bufferyard required by 
Article IV of this Ordinance and the subject property is physically unable, because of its limited land area, to meet normal 
bufferyard requirements, the following requirements shall be met: 
 

A.   In no case shall bufferyard requirements less than those provided in Figure 7-1 be applied to the site. 
 
B.  Where an anchor tenant (40,000 square feet of gross floor area or larger) of a shopping center has been 

replaced, full compliance with the bufferyard requirements of Article IV shall result.  When such 
alterations shall result in a nonconformity with the provisions of this Ordinance (i.e., required parking), 
or an increase in an already nonconforming aspect of the Ordinance, the site shall conform to 
subsection A, above. 

 
C.   If in the judgment of the Planning Director and City Engineer, subsection B cannot be met, then upon 

evaluation of the size and other relevant characteristics of a site, bufferyard width and planting 
requirements may be prorated as appropriate, in consultation with the Planning Commission. 

 
Section 715.  Nonconforming Signs.  
 
A nonconforming sign is any sign within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Auburn on the effective 
date of this Article or any sign existing within any area annexed into such jurisdiction after the effective date of this 
Article which is prohibited by, or does not conform to the requirements of Article VI of this Ordinance. 

 
Nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition.  However, such signs shall: 

 
A. not be structurally altered to accommodate another nonconforming sign or sign face; 
 
B. not be structurally altered in order to prolong the life of the sign, except to meet safety requirements as 

specified by the Chief Building Official or City Engineer; 
 
C. not be altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign (including additional or 

replacement sign faces); 
 
D. not be enlarged in any manner; 
 
E. not be allowed to remain if a change of use occurs as defined by this ordinance, or if the premises 

promoted by the sign comes under new ownership or tenancy and such sign is proposed to be 
remodeled, repainted, have the face replaced or otherwise changed for the purpose of displaying the 
new name or other new identification of the premises; or 

 
F. not be re-established after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction or repair 

exceeds 50 percent of the appraised replacement cost.  This cost shall be exclusive of any expected or 
estimated revenue generated by the sign. 

 
G. be removed if the sign or sign structure identifying a previous use or activity that has not occupied the 

site for a period greater than sixty (60) days, does not maintain a current business license or pertains  
to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies.  The owner of the sign or owner of the property 
shall have 60 days to remove the sign.

ARTICLE VIII.    DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS 

Section 800.  Purpose. 

This Article sets forth the procedures required for obtaining development approval within the City of 
Auburn.  Site plans, subdivisions, conditional uses, zoning certificates, and certificates of occupancy are 
addressed herein.  However, the approval of a development under the provisions of this Article does not 
imply any variation or waiver of any provisions of the building code, housing code, fire code, or any other 
applicable code, standard, or regulation adopted by the City of Auburn, the State of Alabama, or the United 
States Government. 

Section 801.  Subdivisions. 

Any subdivision or resubdivision of land, or combining of lots within the City of Auburn, and within 
unincorporated areas lying within three (3) miles of the Auburn city limits, shall be carried out in 
accordance with the Auburn Subdivision Regulations, the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction 
Manual, and the Water Resource Management Department Design and Construction Manual, which are 
hereby incorporated by reference into this Ordinance.  All development within subdivisions shall be 
consistent with applicable sections of this Ordinance. 

Section 802.  Site Plans. 

802.01. Intent and Purpose.   This Section shall apply to all site plans as defined in Article II.  The site 
plan procedures shall be required in order to ensure that site-specific development projects meet the 
requirements of this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate authorizing a building permit.  It 
is the intent of this Section that the site plan review process be a part of the building permit application 
process, and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the site will be constructed 
and inspected prior to occupancy of the development. 

802.02. Development Requiring Site Plan Approval.  Prior to issuance of a zoning certificate, site plan 
approval shall be required for all proposed non-residential construction, as well as residential development 
types described in Sections 502.02 (F), (G), and (H).  This shall include clubhouses or other ancillary 
facilities within a residential subdivision.  Site plan approval shall also be required for the subdivision of an 
existing development site of a type subject to site plan requirements, and/or an expansion, reduction or 
reconfiguration of any such development type.  For any proposal in which these requirements are unclear, 
the Planning Director shall determine whether site plan approval is necessary. 

802.03. Review of Site Plans.  Site plans submitted for review shall be approved, disapproved, or referred 
to the Planning Commission.  Site plan review shall be in accordance with Section 1.0 – General 
Information of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual.  In approving a site plan, any 
request for waivers from the requirements of this Ordinance shall be taken to the Planning Commission for 
consideration as provided in Section 802.04. 

The following criteria shall be used in determining whether to approve a site plan: 

A. Completeness of application information as required under Section 802.12;

B. Consistency with adopted policies and standards of the Major Streets and Utilities Master
Plans;

C. Uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this Ordinance;

D. Whether the site plan meets applicable design standards established by this Ordinance;

VIII-1



E. Availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development, such as 
roads, sewer, water, schools, solid waste disposal, and fire protection (including access to 
the site for emergency vehicles); and 

 
F. Compatibility with surrounding land uses (this criterion shall apply only where a site plan 

proposes a conditional use pursuant to Section 803). 
 

The Planning Director and/or City Engineer may refer any site plan proposal to the Planning Commission. 
 
802.04. Waiver of Selected Development Standards – Approval by Planning Commission.  Specific 
development standards that may be modified with Planning Commission Approval are limited to the 
following:  bufferyards, including width, planting and required structures; and general and off-street 
parking landscaping requirements.  This may be done only upon a specific finding by the Planning 
Commission that such requirements are inappropriate as applied to a particular development site due to its 
size, proposed use, and/or location, and that a waiver would not conflict with the intent of this Ordinance or 
confer upon any property owner a right or privilege denied to neighboring property owners within the same 
district. 
 
802.05. Review Procedures.  Site plan applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Planning 
Director and staff prior to formal submission of a site plan for review.  At the applicant’s request, a pre-
application conference shall be held, at which time planning staff members will provide the applicant with 
advice and guidance regarding the requirements of this Ordinance, and any other regulations which apply.  
Preliminary sketches shall be reviewed and overall development concepts finalized at this time.  It shall be 
the applicant’s responsibility to request the pre-application conference and any other available guidance in 
sufficient time to prepare a complete application package.  Site plan submittals shall be in accordance with 
Section 1.0 – General Information of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual.   
 

A. Site Plan Preparation Requirements.  Where the proposed development site is three (3) 
acres in size or larger, the site plan shall be prepared and sealed by an architect, 
professional engineer or surveyor.  At the Planning Directors discretion, the same 
requirement may be applied to sites of less than three (3) acres where the plan proposes 
high-intensity uses or activities that may have a substantial impact on surrounding 
properties. 

 
Sketch plans and drawings submitted with variance or other zoning-related applications 
shall not be accepted for review as a site plan unless they are prepared in accordance with 
the guidelines of this Section and contain all required information.  In all cases, 
engineering plans addressing drainage, road construction and other technical aspects of 
development design shall be sealed by a civil engineer registered in the State of Alabama. 

 
B.   Development Site Requirements.  For development sites of one (1) acre or more, full 

engineering drawings or a Project Engineer’s Statement must be submitted by an 
engineer registered in the State of Alabama.  The City Engineer may choose to require 
additional information as necessary. 

 
C.   Completeness of Plans.  Site plans submitted without complete information in 

accordance with Section 802.12 shall not be reviewed by the Planning Staff or placed on 
the Planning Commission Agenda. 

 
D.   Staff Review.  The Planning Director and other appropriate city staff members shall 

review the site plan with specific regard to this Ordinance and other regulations of the 
City of Auburn.  The staff review shall identify matters of development policy concern to 
which the applicant shall address particular attention. 

 

VIII-2



E.   Revised Plans.  Following submission of a complete application package for site plan 
review the Planning staff shall have 15 working days in which to complete the review 
and approve the site plan. 

 
For site plans that must go before the Planning Commission, at such time as the Planning 
Commission determines that all staff comments have been adequately addressed, and that 
the requirements of all applicable City, State and Federal regulations have been met, it 
shall approve the site plan.   

 
802.06. Approval of Site Plans.  Except as stipulated in Section 802.04, no site plan shall be approved 
which is inconsistent with any term contained in this Ordinance unless a variance has been authorized in 
accordance with Section 907 of this Ordinance. 
 
802.07. Effect of Site Plan Approval.  Approved site plans shall remain valid for 18 months after final 
approval, and a zoning certificate and building permit for the development may be obtained during that 
time period.  The Planning Director may make an extension of site plan approval for a single period up to 
six (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire.  An extension may be granted only if 
the Planning Director concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in 
good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application.  All such 
requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 days before the expiration of the 
approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension request. 
 
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted.  Instead, the applicant shall submit 
a new application for review according to the requirements of this Section. 
 
Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction drawings to the 
Engineering Services and Inspection Services Departments for permitting.  These shall include, but are not 
limited to, detailed building plans, grading plans, drainage and stormwater management facilities, erosion 
control plans, road and driveway construction specifications, and tree removal plans. 
 
Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Inspection Services Department from accepting for review and 
processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing 
systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions as may be established by that 
department relative to processing of site plans prior to final approval. 
 
In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a zoning 
certificate and the site plan has been stamped approved and is on file in the office of the Inspection Services 
Department.  All building and construction permits issued for any project requiring site plan review shall be 
consistent with the stamped approved site plan.  The approval of a site plan shall not under any 
circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the applicable City requirements for 
construction or installation of structures or materials.  Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such 
construction details occurs, the more restrictive or that requiring the higher standard shall prevail. 
 
802.08. Modification or Termination of Site Plans. 
 

A.   Site Plan Amendments.  After final approval, any modification, variation or adjustment 
of a stamped approved site plan shall require approval of a site plan amendment. 

 
Upon approval of any amendment, the Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall stamp 
and date the most recent version of the site plan, showing the approved amendment, and 
mark all previous copies as “void”.  If appropriate, the Engineering and Inspection 
Services Departments shall be notified of the amendment. 

 
B.   Site Plan Expiration and Cancellation.  In the event of a change to these regulations the 

site plan shall be valid under the regulations for which it was approved for 18 months 
from the date of such approval.  Upon expiration of the site plan and any extension that 

VIII-3



may have been granted, the Planning Director shall make appropriate records in the 
Planning Department files stamp all available copies of the site plan as “void”, and notify 
the Engineering and Codes Enforcement Divisions of the expiration. 

 
The applicant may cancel the site plan at any time between the date of final approval and 
the date of expiration by submitting a written request to the Planning Director. Upon 
receipt of this request by the Planning Director, the site plan shall be treated as expired. 

 
802.09. Integration of Other Review Procedures.  Any site plan to be built in stages or requiring 
variance or conditional use approval shall be coordinated as set forth below: 
 

A.   Development Built in Stages.  As part of the application for site plan approval, the 
developer shall submit a proposed staging of development plan, including a schedule for 
completion of all improvements pursuant to Section 505.02.  If the site plan proposes any 
of the performance residential housing types described in Section 502.02 (A) through 
(G), a Master Development Plan pursuant to Section 505 shall also be required.  Once a 
site plan for a stage has been approved, no land may be used and no building may be 
occupied except in accordance with such plan.  A new site plan is required for each 
successive stage of the development. 

 
Stage configurations shall be logical and consistent with the purposes of this Ordinance.  
If appropriate, the Planning Director may stipulate that any or all portions of the required 
landscaping and/or bufferyards be provided during the first stage of development, even 
though some bufferyards or portions thereof lie outside the stage.  Each stage, at a 
minimum, must include adequate parking, drainage facilities, landscaping, and all other 
features needed to serve that portion of the total development (See Sections 505.02 and 
505.06). 

 
Prior to approval for construction of any one stage, an engineering stage plan shall be 
submitted to and approved by the City Engineer.  This plan shall address site grading, 
erosion control, stormwater management, internal traffic circulation, and any other design 
elements required by the City Engineer. 

 
In approving a stage plan, the Planning Commission or Planning staff may specify certain 
site improvements to be provided at a percentage rate exceeding that of construction of 
the overall development.  These items may be elements of engineering design, or 
requirements of this Ordinance.   Such improvements include, but are not limited to 
parking, drainage facilities, erosion control measures, landscaping and bufferyards.  
Where the applicant has agreed to provide off-site improvements, such as traffic signals, 
turn lanes, and sewer lines, the City Engineer may require such improvements to be in 
place upon completion of any stage of the development. 

 
B.   Variance.  Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this 

Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted 
upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.  This shall include existing development sites, 
proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement 
of this Ordinance.  The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on 
the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been 
approved. 

 
C.   Conditional Uses.  For developments requiring approval of a conditional use, a request 

for such approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission and City Council, and 
the conditional use shall be approved prior to final approval of the site plan.  A site plan 
and a conditional use request may be processed concurrently. 

 

VIII-4



802.10. Non-Compliance.  Failure to comply with a stamped approved site plan or any of the conditions 
upon which such approval was contingent, including time limits for performance, shall be cause to deny 
issuance of a zoning certificate or, where a zoning certificate has been issued pursuant to a stamped 
approved site plan, to render such zoning certificate invalid.  Any action, construction, development or use 
of property undertaken in violation of the provisions of this Section for a site plan shall constitute a 
violation of this Ordinance and may be subject to a stop-work order. 
 
802.11. Development Site to Be Unified. 
 

A.   Internal Division of Ownership.  Except as provided in this section, the development 
site shall remain unified by title under one (1) owner, or by multiple owners holding a 
percentage interest in the site as a whole.  Where a development site consists of two (2) 
or more existing lots under the same ownership, all such lots shall be combined in 
accordance with the Subdivision Regulations prior to final approval of the site plan. 

 
Where spatial division of ownership within a development site is proposed, the owners of 
all component properties shall accept the following conditions in receiving site plan 
approval: 

 
1. No individual property will be used or developed in any way that is not 

consistent with the approved site plan. 
 
2. Development rights on each parcel are combined with those of the balance of 

the development site, and the City will consider no separate development 
proposals unless the development site can be divided in accordance with the 
provisions of this Ordinance. 

 
3. No parcel of land within a development site shall be subdivided, sold or 

otherwise conveyed for the purpose of new development that is not authorized 
under the approved site plan. 

 
All owners of property within the development site shall authorize one (1) person, 
designated as the applicant, to represent them collectively before the Planning 
Commission and other City officials in all matters related to the site plan and 
development site. 

 
B.   External Ownership.  When the development site is part of a larger parcel of property, 

of which a portion is not intended to be included within the site plan, this unused area 
shall become a separate lot, meeting any relevant size and dimensional requirements of 
this Ordinance, to be approved in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations.  This 
subdivision process shall be completed prior to final approval of the site plan. 

 
C.   Development Site to Be Complete.  The development site shall be designed to provide 

all required amenities and facilities, including bufferyards, open space, landscaping; no 
such required features shall be located off-site or on adjacent properties which are leased, 
rented, or otherwise proposed for use on an informal basis, except as provided for in 
Section 509.02.  The entire site shall have the zoning designation required to 
accommodate the principal use. 

 
D.   Division After Approval.  No development site, once granted site plan approval, shall be 

divided except through the site plan amendment process established in Section 802.08. 
 
802.12. Site Plan Preparation Requirements.  A site plan must accurately show all relevant information 
about a proposed development to permit it to be reviewed against the requirements of this Ordinance, and 
to provide a permanent record as to the type and characteristics of development approved on the site.  Site 
plans shall be drawn, on an overall sheet size not to exceed 24 by 36 inches, to one of the following scales:   

VIII-5



   1”:10’ 
   1”:20’ 
   1”:30’ 
   1”:40’ 
   1”:50’ 
   1”:60’ 
   1”:100’ 

When more than one (1) sheet is needed, a series of drawings showing different elements of the site design, 
such as landscaping, utilities, or topography may be submitted.  Where such a series is submitted, the top 
sheet shall include an index of all other sheets in the series.  These shall be bound in a single package, with 
each sheet labeled as to what it shows and its number in the series (e.g., Landscaping Plan, Sheet 2 of 3)   

Unless specifically waived by the Planning Director, the following information shall be shown on all site 
plans:   
 

A. Written Information: 
 
   1. Site plan name.

C. Items to be Submitted to Engineering Department: 

 
1. Items to be submitted shall be in accordance with Section 1.0 – General 

Information of the Auburn Engineering Design and Construction Manual. 
 
Section 803.  Conditional Uses. 
 
Conditional uses are those uses that have some special impact which differs from the potential impacts of 
permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have a uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding 
environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a particular location. 
 
Upon submission of a request for conditional use approval, a review of the location, design, configuration, 
and impact shall be conducted to determine whether the proposed use would have a detrimental impact on 
neighboring properties. 
 
The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; 
planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by the proposed use; 
whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is consistent with the 
intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and any other development policies and/or regulations of the City of 
Auburn; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize 
any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and 
welfare in general. 
 
803.01. Applicability.  Any use designated as a conditional use by Table 4-1 of this Ordinance shall 
comply with this Section. 
 
In addition, the following shall be approved only as conditional uses: 
 

A. Any performance residential use (except Manufactured home parks, which are not 
allowed) in the Corridor Redevelopment District, Urban (CRD-U) and Suburban (CRD-
S), and Multiple Unit Development in the Corridor Redevelopment District, West (CRD-
W) and East (CRD-E), and Planned Development District (PDD). 

 
803.02. Procedures.  Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted and approved prior to 
application for a zoning certificate.  A subdivision plat or a site plan meeting the requirements of Section 
802 shall support applications for conditional uses in all districts.  Site plan or subdivision approval shall 
not be granted prior to or contingent upon conditional use approval. 
 
The Planning Director shall process applications for a conditional use permit as follows: 
 

A. Applications for a conditional use permit must be submitted to the Planning Director 23 
days prior to the public hearing, as required in Section 803.02 (B).  Copies of the 
application shall be distributed to the appropriate department heads. 

VIII-8



 
B. A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission after adjoining property 

owners have been notified of the public hearing by certified mail and signs announcing 
the public hearing have been erected on the property in question.  Not later than five (5) 
days prior to the date set for the hearing on the application, the Planning Director shall 
file a written report thereon with the Planning Commission. 

 
C. The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds that the application and 

record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance.  Further, the 
application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any 
mitigating conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission, outweigh any 
public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall 
public health, safety, and welfare. 

 
D. In order to prevent or minimize adverse effects on other properties in the neighborhood 

and on the general health, safety, and welfare of the City of Auburn, the Planning 
Commission may impose such restrictions and conditions on approval of the proposed 
use as it determines are required by the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this 
Ordinance.  All conditions imposed upon any conditional use permit approval, except 
those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in the 
resolution granting such conditional use permits. 

 
E. Within 35 days of the public hearing on the application, unless an extension of this time 

is agreed to by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall render to the City Council 
its recommendation either to grant the application for a conditional use permit, grant it 
subject to conditions, or deny it.  The failure of the Planning Commission to act within 
this time period shall constitute a recommendation by it that the application be approved. 

 
Within 60 days of the Planning Commission rendering its recommendation to the City 
Council, the City Council shall take action on the application, otherwise the application 
shall fail.  The City Council may elect to grant an extension for good cause.  Following a 
public hearing, the City Council shall either approve, or disapprove, the application and 
shall establish the specific conditions under which the application is approved.   

 
F. In the event a permit for a conditional use is approved or approved subject to conditions, 

the applicant shall submit a site plan meeting all conditions of approval. The Planning 
Director shall then take action to process the application on the zoning certificate for the 
development to which the conditional use permit applies.  In the event such permit is not 
approved or is approved subject to conditions that are not acceptable to the applicant, the 
applicant may, within the aforesaid time period, either appeal such decision or abandon 
the application. 

 
803.03. Conditions on Conditional Use Approvals.  Every conditional use permit shall be contingent 
upon the proposed development fully complying with all requirements of this Ordinance and, where 
applicable, with the Subdivision Regulations.  The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use 
permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 
 
803.04. General Use Standards.   No application for a conditional use permit shall be approved unless 
the City Council shall specifically find the proposed conditional use appropriate in the location for which it 
is proposed.  This finding shall be based on the following criteria: 
 

A. The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and 
standards of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or 
under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City. 
 

VIII-9



B. The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue 
adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, 
parking, public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the 
public health, safety, and general welfare; either as they now exist or as they may in the 
future be developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this 
Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under 
consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other governmental agency 
having jurisdiction to guide growth and development. 

 
C. The proposed use will be adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden on 

any of the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection.  
Where any such improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or 
adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part 
of the application and as a condition to approval of the proposed conditional use permit, 
be responsible for establishing ability, willingness, and bind commitment to provide such 
improvements, facilities, utilities, and services in sufficient time and in a manner 
consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, programs, maps, and ordinances adopted 
by the City to guide its growth and development.  The approval of the conditional use 
permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services 
being provided and guaranteed by the applicant. 

 
D. The Planning Commission may attach recommendations for conditional use approval, 

additional criteria dealing with bufferyards, parking, lighting, building materials, or any 
other aspect of site plan approval necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed 
conditional use on the surrounding property. 

 
803.05. Effect of Conditional Use Approval.  Upon final approval of a conditional use permit, no 
structures, uses or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development site except in accordance 
with the site plan approval process as set forth in Section 802. 
 
Conditional use permits shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval.  The City Council, upon 
recommendation by the Planning Commission, may make an extension of conditional use permit approval 
for a single period of up to six (6) months from the date when a conditional use permit would otherwise 
expire.  An extension may be granted only if the City Council concludes that the applicant or developer has 
proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to 
warrant a new application.  All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 
days before the expiration of the conditional use permit stating the reason for the time extension request. 
 
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted.  Instead, the applicant shall submit 
a new application for review according to the requirements of this section.  
 
Section 804.  Zoning Certificates. 
 
No development permitted by this Ordinance, including accessory and temporary uses, may be established 
and no existing building may be altered with respect to its use after the effective date of this Ordinance 
until a zoning certificate has been secured from the Planning Director. 
 
Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the additional responsibility of seeking any permit required by 
any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulations in compliance with all of the terms of this Ordinance.  
Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other ordinances.   
 
The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 
 
804.01. Application Requirements for Zoning Certificates.  All applications for zoning certificates shall 
be made in writing by the owner or developer of the property for which it is sought.  The application shall 
be filed with the Planning Director and include two (2) copies of the following: 

VIII-10



 
A. Legal description of the parcel(s) for which the certificate is sought. 
 
B. Conditional Use Permit, if required (Section 803). 
 
C. Request for site plan review if required (Section 802). 

 
When a zoning certificate is sought for a development that is a part of a plat or subdivision, which has 
received final plat approval or which has been issued a conditional use permit, the plat or conditional use 
permit, together with any covenants, conditions, or other restrictions related thereto, shall be submitted as a 
part of the application for the zoning certificate. 
 
Application for a conditional use permit, where required, shall be made and approval granted by the City 
Council prior to application for a zoning certificate. 
 
In the case of any development located within a subdivision, the subdivision shall have final plat approval 
and have been recorded before the Planning Director will accept an application for a zoning certificate.  If 
the development for which a zoning certificate is sought is required by this Ordinance to undergo site plan 
review, the approved site plan shall be made a part of the application for a zoning certificate and shall 
suffice as the statement of proposed use required by this Section. 
 
A temporary use and an accessory use shall require a zoning certificate as a precondition to their lawful 
establishment.  The Planning Director may establish regulations governing the application requirements for 
a zoning certificate in the case of either a temporary or accessory use that is established at any time other 
than simultaneously with a principal use, in which case all information specified in this Section shall be 
submitted.  The purpose of the required information is to provide the Planning Director with a sufficient 
factual basis to determine whether all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to temporary and 
accessory uses have been met. 
 
804.02. Procedures.  All developments for which a zoning certificate is required shall be reviewed for 
compliance with this Ordinance; within 30 calendar days after the application for a zoning certificate has 
been accepted, the Planning Director shall inform the applicant whether the application has been granted. 
 

A. In any case where the application is granted, the Planning Director shall issue a zoning 
certificate which shall state:  “This certificate does not signify building codes review or 
approval nor subdivision review or approval and is not authorization to undertake any 
work without such review and approval where either is required.  Before any structure to 
which this certificate is applicable may be occupied or used for any purpose, a certificate 
of occupancy must be obtained.” 

 
B. In any case where an application is denied, the Planning Director shall state the specific 

reasons and shall cite the specific chapters, articles, and sections of this Ordinance upon 
which denial is based.  If relief of such denial would be available by special permit or 
variance, the Planning Director shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the 
appropriate sections of this Ordinance. 

 
Following site plan and/or conditional use approval, an applicant shall have 18 months from the date of 
approval to begin construction.  In addition, an applicant shall have 90 days from the date of issuance of a 
zoning certificate to begin construction.  For the purposes of this Section, beginning of construction is 
defined as the date on which a building permit is issued by the City of Auburn for the construction, 
renovation, modification, or other work required. 
 
Section 805.  Certificate of Occupancy. 
 
No land or building for which a zoning certificate has been issued shall be occupied or used in whole or in 
part for any use whatsoever after the effective date of this Ordinance until the owner, tenants, contract 

VIII-11



purchaser, or authorized agent thereof has been issued a certificate of occupancy by the Senior Building 
Inspector, indicating that the building or use complies with all zoning requirements of this Ordinance, the 
building code, and other applicable codes and regulations. 
 
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the premises in question have been inspected and found by 
the Senior Building Inspector to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
 
No permit for any new use or construction that will involve the on-site disposal of sewage or waste, and no 
permit for a change in use or an alteration that will result in an increased volume of sewage or waste to be 
disposed of on the site, or which requires the County Health Department’s approval shall be issued until 
said approval has been issued by said Health Department. 
 
The issuance of a certificate of occupancy in no way relieves any recipient thereof from compliance with 
all of the terms of this Ordinance and all other applicable regulations. 
 
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless required bufferyards have been installed or appropriately 
bonded.  
 
Section 806.  Access. 
 
As a precondition to approval of any site plan, subdivision plat, zoning certificate, building permit, or any 
other type of development permit, any development site shall have legal access to a publicly owned and 
maintained road.  Physical access alone shall not qualify any development site for such permits.  Legal 
access shall consist of the required length of road frontage, a flag lot approval pursuant to Section 512, or 
access easements under this Section. 
 
806.01. Access Easements.  Access by easement shall be approved only by specific action of the Planning 
Commission, and where normal requirements cannot be met.  In all such cases, the following conditions 
shall apply: 
 

A. The property owner seeking a permit shall possess a valid legal instrument, recorded in 
the Office of the Judge of Probate, indicating ownership of an access strip or easement at 
least 15 feet in width connecting the subject property with a public road; 

 
B. No access shall serve more than one (1) building site; 
 
C. No development shall be authorized on any such building site other than one (1) single 

family dwelling and permitted accessory structures; 
 
D. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the access shall be graded and/or covered 

with a suitable surface so as to be passable to emergency vehicles; and 
 
E. The permit applicant shall sign a statement indicating that the City of Auburn has no 

obligation to repair and/or maintain the access in a usable condition, and that the City 
shall not be liable for injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from the site’s 
lack of direct access to a public road. 

 
Section 807.  Fees. 
 
A schedule of application fees for site plan and subdivision approval, zoning certificates, and other permits 
and public hearings required under this Ordinance shall be established by separate resolution or ordinance.  
This fee schedule shall be computed so as to recover all costs incurred by the City in reviewing and 
processing zoning-related requests, and shall be revised as necessary by the City Council.

Section 905.  Interpretations. 
 
905.01. Purpose.  The provisions of this section are intended to provide a simple and expeditious method 
for clarifying ambiguities in the text of this Ordinance, the zoning map which it incorporates, and the rules 
and regulations adopted pursuant to it.  It is also intended to provide a simple procedure for overcoming 
rigidities and limitations of finite use lists.  
 
905.02. Authority.  The Planning Director may, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations set 
forth in this Section, render interpretations of any provision of this Ordinance or any rule or regulation 
issued pursuant to it, including interpretations of the various uses in any district not expressly mentioned in 
this Ordinance. 
 
905.03. Procedure. 
 

A. Written Request for Non-Use Interpretation.  Except as provided below, a request for 
interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance, the zoning map, or any rule or 
regulation adopted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be submitted in writing to the 
Planning Director.  No fee shall be required in connection with any such request.  Each 
such request shall set forth the specific provision or provisions to be interpreted, the facts 
of the specific situation giving rise to the request for an interpretation, and the precise 
interpretation claimed by the applicant to be correct.  Before rendering any interpretation, 
the Planning Director shall receive such further facts and information as are in his 
judgment necessary to a meaningful interpretation of the provision in question. 

 
B. Application for Use Interpretation.  Applications for a use interpretation shall be 

submitted to the Planning Director and shall, in all instances, contain at least the 
following information and documentation: 

 
1. The applicant’s names, address, and interest in the subject property. 
 
2. The owner’s name and address, if different from the applicant’s, and the owner’s 

signed consent to the filing of the application. 
 
3. The names and addresses of all professional consultants advising the applicant 

with respect to the interpretation. 
 
4. The street address and legal description of the subject property. 
 
5. The zoning classification and present use of the subject property. 
 
6. A complete description of the proposed use. 
 
7. The uses permitted by the present zoning classification, which are most similar 

to the proposed use. 
 
8. Documents, statements, and other evidence demonstrating that the proposed use 

will comply with all use limitations established for the district in which it is 
proposed to be located. 

 
9. Such other and further information or documentation as the Planning Director 

may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and 
disposition of the particular application. 

  
C. Planning Director.  Within 30 days following the receipt by the Planning Director of a 

completed request or application for interpretation, the Planning Director shall mail a 
written copy of the interpretation to the applicant.  The Planning Director shall state the 

IX-4



  

specific precedent, reasons, and analysis on which such interpretation is based.  The 
failure of the Planning Director to render an interpretation within such time, or such 
longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed to be a 
rejection of the applicant’s proposed interpretation.  The Planning Director shall keep a 
copy of each such interpretation on file and shall make a copy of each such file 
interpretation available for public inspection during normal business hours. 

 
D. Appeal.  Appeals on interpretations rendered by the Planning Director pursuant to this 

Section may be taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment as provided in this Article. 
 
905.04. Conditions on Use Interpretations.  The following conditions shall govern the Planning 
Director, and the Board of Zoning Adjustment on appeals from the Planning Director, in issuing use 
interpretations: 
 

A. No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use that was previously 
considered and rejected by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on an application for 
amendment. 

 
B. No use interpretation shall permit a use in any district in which such use is not listed 

either as permitted or conditional in Table 4-1. 
 
C. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be 

presented which demonstrates that it will comply with each use limitation established for 
the particular district. 

 
D. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is 

substantially similar to other uses permitted in such district and is more similar to such 
other uses than to uses permitted or conditionally permitted in a less restrictive district. 

 
E. If the proposed use is more similar to a conditional use than a permitted use in the district 

in which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation permitting such use shall 
be conditioned on the issuance of a conditional use permit. 

 
F. Any use permitted pursuant to this Section shall fully comply with all requirements and 

standards imposed by this Ordinance. 
 
905.05. Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation.  No use interpretation finding a particular use to be 
permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or 
the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall 
merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals 
which may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Auburn, or other governmental agencies 
having jurisdiction.  These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, zoning certificates, 
conditional use permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy. 
 
905.06. Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations.  No use interpretation finding a particular use to 
be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified district shall supersede subsequent amendment to this 
Ordinance. 
 
Section 906.  Amendments. 
 
This Ordinance may be amended from time to time as conditions warrant in the following manner.  As used 
herein, the term “application” includes City Council resolution. 
 

A. Initiation Procedures.  A proposed change to the zoning district boundaries or of the 
regulations may be initiated by the City Council, the Auburn Planning Commission, or by 

IX-5



  

petition of one or more owners or authorized agents of such owners of property within 
the area proposed to be changed. 

 
B. Text Amendments.  The application for an amendment to the text of this Ordinance shall 

state in particular the article, section, subsection, and paragraph sought to be amended.  
The application shall contain the language of the proposed amendment and shall recite 
the reasons for such proposed change in the text. 

 
C. Map Amendments. 
 

1. Applications to rezone any property, or any application which seeks to change 
or modify the standards and requirements imposed on a particular piece of 
property by the text and maps of this Ordinance, including applications for 
variances and conditional use permits, may be instituted by the City of Auburn 
or all the owners of the property sought to be affected, or their assigns. 

 
2. In the case where the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, said 

applicant shall secure a notarized authorization to act as applicant from the 
property owner, along with the regularly required copy of the deed for the 
property. 

 
3. When a development proposal involves approval of a site plan or subdivision 

plat in addition to a zoning map amendment, no site plan or subdivision plat 
approval shall be granted prior to approval of the map amendment.  If a 
development plan and the corresponding request for zoning change are to be 
addressed at the same public hearing, the Planning Commission shall render a 
decision on the zoning application before considering any related site plan or 
subdivision plat.  Such decision shall be based on the requirements of this 
Ordinance and the full range of uses permitted in the requested district, and not 
on the specific development concept proposed by the applicant. 

 
4. All properties annexed into the City of Auburn shall receive the Rural (R) 

District designation.  If another zoning designation is desired, the owner or 
authorized representative shall make application for rezoning in accordance with 
these regulations. 

 
D. Public Hearing.  Upon application, the Planning Commission shall, after giving 15 days 

notice, conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment.  The Planning Commission 
shall consider and make recommendations on all proposed amendments, taking into 
account:  (1) the testimony at the hearing; (2) a site inspection of the property in question; 
(3) the recommendations from interested official bodies; and (4) the standards provided 
below. 

 
906.01. Standards for Map Amendments. 
 

A. No rezoning of land from the Rural (R) District to the Comprehensive Development 
District (CDD) or Development District Housing (DDH), or from CDD or DDH to R 
shall be permitted except upon a specific and documented finding that: 

 
1. A change in demand which significantly (by a factor of at least 25 percent) alters 

the development potential of the land has occurred such as:  (a) a significant 
change in migration patterns, family size, or birth rate since the last amendment 
of the CDD or DDH or (b) a major change, such as the construction of a major 
road, the installation of a sewer line, or the provision of a formerly unavailable 
water supply, which significantly alters the suitability of an area for 
development. 

IX-6



  

2. An area designated as a CDD or DDH has been precluded from development by 
unanticipated, long term events such as the non-provision of a sewer plant or 
interceptor or a sewer ban, and that said area constitutes a significant part of the 
total amount of the planned CDD or DDH. 

 
B. No rezoning of land to the Urban Core (UC) District shall be permitted except upon a 

specific and documented finding that: 
 

1. Marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities of an Urban Core 
District that cannot be provided by the district planned and mapped as urban 
core on the official zoning map and, 

 
2. Impact studies of the existing Urban Core District and development in other 

districts, within a one (1) mile radius of the site proposed for rezoning, 
demonstrate that the proposed rezoning will not have adverse impacts on their 
economic viability and, 

 
3. Traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed urban core development will not 

have adverse impacts on the level of service of arterial roads, whether in 
incorporated or unincorporated areas, within a two (2) mile radius of the site 
proposed for rezoning. 

 
C. No rezoning of land to the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts 

shall be permitted except on a specific and documented finding that: 
 

1. Marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities and uses of the Urban 
Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts that cannot be provided by 
the districts planned and mapped as Urban Neighborhood on the official zoning 
map, and; 

 
2. Improvements to streets and pedestrian ways, either existing or planned, can be 

undertaken in a manner that does not adversely impact the existing planned 
system of access and separation of vehicular and foot traffic, and; 

 
3. Traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed Urban Neighborhood development 

will not adversely impact the level of service of arterial roads, whether in 
incorporated or unincorporated areas, within a two (2) mile radius of the site of 
the proposed rezoning. 

 
D. No rezoning of land to the Industrial (I) District shall be permitted except on a specific 

and documented finding that: 
 

1. There is an inadequate supply of land zoned for these uses or the proposed use 
cannot be accommodated by those sites due to lack of transportation, water, or 
sewer, or that the market area to be served by the proposed use cannot be 
efficiently served by the geographical location of the existing Industrial District. 

 
2. Roads, floodplains, or other existing or planned features will insure sufficient 

buffering to protect surrounding land and uses from the negative impacts of the 
proposed industrial use. 

 
E. If all owners in an existing subdivision or proposed subdivision located in any R, CDD, 

DDH or RDD district petition the City Council for a Neighborhood Conservation District 
designation, it may be granted. 

 

IX-7



  

F. There shall be no rezoning of land from Rural to any other district until such time as 
adequate public utilities are available. 

 
906.02. Recommendation of the Planning Commission.   
 

A. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council.  Within 60 
days of the Planning Commission rendering its recommendation to the City Council, the 
City Council shall take action on the application, otherwise the application shall fail.  The 
City Council may elect to grant an extension for good cause.  No amendment shall be 
passed except by a majority vote of the members of the City Council present.  

 
B. The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment 

unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public interest and not 
solely for the interest of the applicant. 

 
C.  For each disapproved map amendment, the Planning Commission shall make findings on 

each of the following matters based on the evidence presented to it: 
 

1. The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the 
proposed zoning. 

 
2. The adequacy of public facilities, such as sewer and water, and other required 

public services. 
 
Section 907.  Variances. 
 
907.01. Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to empower the Board of Zoning Adjustment to vary or 
adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this Ordinance.  It is expected that the granting of 
variances will be rare; however, a variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, 
shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and 
exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of any regulation enacted 
under this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such 
property. 
 
Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction with site 
plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.  This shall 
include existing development sites, proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to 
any requirement of this Ordinance.  The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on 
the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved. 
 
907.02. Application.  Any property owner may apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance 
using forms to be obtained from the Planning Department at least 15 days prior to the next regularly 
scheduled meeting of the Board. 
 
907.03. Standards for Variances.  The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict 
application of the provision of this Ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards 
are satisfied.  In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall be 
sparingly exercised.  It is the intent of this Ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some 
exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and 
prevents its owner from using the property as intended by the Zoning Ordinance.  Any variance granted 
shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. 
 
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical 
difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted.  In particular, the applicant shall establish 
and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and standards listed 
below: 

IX-8



  

 
A. The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of 

the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall 
not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 

 
B. The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use, which is not 

permitted in the district. 
 
C. There must be proof of unique circumstances:  there must exist special circumstances or 

conditions fully described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which 
the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or 
buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the district, and which 
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this 
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building. 

 
D. There must be proof of unnecessary hardship.  It is not sufficient proof of hardship to 

show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted.  Furthermore, the 
hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by 
one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions; it must result from the 
application of this Ordinance; it must be suffered directly by the property in question; and 
evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered. 

 
E. That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or 

building and that the variance as granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment is the 
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose. 

 
F. That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent 

property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of 
fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within 
the adjacent neighborhood. 

 
G. That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special 

privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the 
same district. 

 
The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the 
regulations or provisions to which the variance applies. 
 
907.04. Standards for Variances Applicable to the Airport.  Any person desiring to erect or increase the 
height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations 
of this Section may apply to the Auburn Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance from such regulations.  
Applications for variances shall follow the same procedure for other variances.  The application for a 
variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the 
Airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, 
efficient use of navigable airspace.   
 
A. Criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed 
development and determined its construction would exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the 
board of adjustment may grant an airport obstruction variance for a proposed development. Such a variance 
may be granted if the board determines that: 

 
1.  The literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical 

difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to 
the public interest (i.e. the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace 
without adverse impact to surrounding environs) 
 

IX-9



  

2. Granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation. 
 

3. Granting the variance will do substantial justice. 
 

4. The variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations. 
 
All variances shall be subject to conditions and terms as recommended by the FAA. 

 
B. The following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be approved: 
   

1.    A condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved 
structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an 
obstruction in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number 
70/7460-1K, as it may be amended. Where such marking or lighting is required, such 
requirement shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) 
for the affected structure. 
   

2.   The FAA must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid. 
   

3.    Consideration shall be given to: 
   

a.  The nature of the terrain and height (height per § 512.02) of existing structures. 
 
b. Public and private interests and investments. 
 
c. The character of flying operations and planned development of airports. 
 
d.  FAA designated federal airways. 
 
e. Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the 

minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport. 
 
f. Technological advances. 
 
g. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air. 
 
h. Land use density. 
 
i. The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. 
 
j. The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or 

proposed structures identified in the City of Auburn. 
 

k. FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the 
FAA. 

 
l. Comments and recommendations from the Airport. 
 
m. Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts. 

 
Obstruction Marking and Lighting.   Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed 
advisable to effectuate the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so 
conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense, to 
install, operate and maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the 
presence of an airport hazard. 
 

IX-10



  

907.05 Public Hearing. Upon application, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall schedule a public hearing 
on the proposed variance to be held ten (10) days after a public notice has been published in the local 
newspaper, after signs announcing the public hearing have been erected on the property in question, and 
after the adjacent property owners most affected by the variance request have been notified by certified 
mail. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider and decide all proposed variances taking into account 
the standards enumerated above. After the close of a public hearing and within ten (10) days the Board of 
Zoning Adjustment shall render a written decision, setting forth the reasons for such decision, which shall 
be accompanied by finding of fact(s) specifying the reason(s) for such decision. All such decisions are final 
and binding on all parties. 
 
Section 908.  Appeals.   
 
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected by any 
provision of this Ordinance or by any decision, or any order to stop, cease, and desist, issued by the 
Planning Director in enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
908.01. General Rules and Procedures for Appeals. 
 

A. Any appeals from the ruling of the Planning Director concerning the enforcement and 
interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance shall be filed with the Planning Director 
within 15 days after the date of the Planning Director’s decision thereon. 

 
B. All appeals and applications made to the Board shall be in writing on forms prescribed by 

the Board and accompanied by fees prescribed by resolution of the City Council. 
 
C. All appeals and applications shall refer to the specific provisions of this Ordinance 

involved. 
 
D. The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal and give due 

notice thereof to the parties and shall render a written decision on the appeal without 
unreasonable delay.  The Board may affirm, reserve, wholly or in part, or modify the 
order, requirement, decision, or determination, as in its opinion it determines ought to be 
done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is 
taken.  The Planning Department shall maintain complete records of all appeal actions of 
the Board. 

 
E. Within ten (10) days after the close of a public hearing the Board shall render a written 

decision giving the reason(s) for its decision. 
 
F. In rendering a decision with respect to an appeal from any order, decision, or 

determination the Board shall strictly interpret the language of the Ordinance and shall 
find that the Planning Director was correct in his decision or in error.  However, the 
Board shall not render any decision which shall modify an order, decision, or 
determination which confers rights or privileges on the appellant that are not otherwise 
permissible under the strict interpretation of this language of this Ordinance. 

 
G. Such decision shall be submitted to the appellant and the Planning Director. 
 

908.02. All decisions rendered by the Board shall be final and binding on all parties.  No request for a 
variance or appeal of an administrative decision shall be reheard, and no further application shall be 
accepted, once a decision has been given, except under one or more of the following conditions: 
 

A. New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was not 
available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing. 

 

IX-11



  

B. The decision resulted from an error in procedures required by the Ordinance or State law 
made by the Board, the Planning Director, or any other City official. 

 
C. The decision resulted from an error in substantive law under the provisions of this 

Ordinance or the Code of Alabama. 
 

Where no error is alleged and no new evidence is available a new or more effective presentation by the 
applicant shall not constitute grounds for rehearing a decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment.  Any 
applicant wishing a rehearing shall appear before the Board to present one or more of the qualifying 
conditions listed in this Section. 
 
If the Board finds that one or more of these conditions exists, the applicant shall be permitted to submit a 
new application, together with the required fees.  The new application shall be heard at a subsequent 
meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements.  Allowing a new 
application does not obligate the Board to grant the request. 
 
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board may within 15 days after such decision appeal to the 
Circuit Court having jurisdiction. 
 
Section 909.  Penalties. 
 
Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not 
more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine 
and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense.  Each day such violation continues shall 
constitute a separate offense. 
 
909.01. Any person who fails to obtain a Zoning Certificate or other permit prior to beginning construction 
or erecting any structure or sign shall be subject to doubling of all applicable fees.
