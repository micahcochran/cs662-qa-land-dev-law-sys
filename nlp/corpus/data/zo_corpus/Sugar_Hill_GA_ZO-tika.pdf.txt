ARTICLE 4. 

ZONING DISTRICTS & USE PROVISIONS 

 

Section 400.  District Designations. 

For the purposes of this Ordinance, the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia is divided into zoning 

districts designated as follows: 

AF Agricultural-Forest District provides for agriculture, forestry, very low 

density residential development, and limited other uses under specific 

conditions. 

RS-200 Low Density Single-Family Residential District provides for twenty 

thousand (20,000) square foot minimum lot sizes. 

RS-175 Low Density Single-Family Residential District provides for seventeen 

thousand five hundred (17,500) square foot minimum lot sizes. 

RS-150 Low Density Single-Family Residential District provides for fifteen 

thousand (15,000) square foot minimum lot sizes. 

 The three (3) Low Density Single-Family Residential Districts include 

existing low density residential areas and vacant or open areas where 

similar residential development is appropriate.  The regulations for these 

districts are designed to encourage low density one-family residential 

development, protected from the depreciating effects of small lot 

development and excessive density. 

RS-100 Medium Density Single-Family Residential District provides for ten 

thousand (10,000) square foot minimum lot sizes.  This district includes 

areas of medium density residential development.  The regulations for this 

district are designed to take advantage of the greater economy and 

convenience afforded by more intensive development but still retain some 

of the open aspects of a detached dwelling unit district. 

RS-72 Medium Density Single-Family Residential District provides for seven 

thousand two hundred (7,200) square foot minimum lot sizes. This district 

includes areas of medium density residential development. The regulations 

for this district are designed to encourage more compact development in 

appropriate transitional areas particularly between existing residential and 

non-residential development. 

MH Mobile Home Park District provides for the transient and permanent uses 

of residential mobile home units within the City in mobile home parks 

located on un-subdivided parcels which have single ownership control.  

Mobile home subdivisions are not permitted.

Amended 10-11-2021 

R36 Medium Density Mixed Residential District provides for one and two 

family dwellings, attached dwellings or small-scale multiple dwellings in 
close proximity to activity or employment centers as well as regional 
transportation corridors such as Highway 20, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard 

and Buford Highway.  The regulations for this district are designed to 

provide an area where individuals and families may establish homes in an 

environment which satisfies their needs for convenience and economy. 

 This zoning district is to be located where public water supply and waste 

water treatment facilities are available or can be obtained and where there 

is convenient access to collector streets, major thoroughfares or state or 

interstate highways.  The purpose of this district is to promote more 

efficient utilization of land and creativity in architectural and engineering 

design favoring traditional neighborhood design principles without 

maximizing density. 

OI Office-Institutional District provides for limited commercial and 

institutional land uses where traffic, noise and congestion are minimized.  

This district is established to provide a location for offices, institutions and 

limited related retail business and service activities in buildings of high 

character in attractive surroundings. Distributive functions such as 

loading, unloading, storage, packaging and un-packaging shall be limited 

to ten (10) percent of the total building area and five (5) percent of the 

total lot area. 

HSB Highway Service Business District provides for limited uses of 

commercial land adjacent to major traffic arteries.  Established to provide 

locations for retail trade establishments compatible with surrounding 

residential and office-institutional areas, and for business activities which 

primarily cater to the traveling public.  The HSB District requires 

individual free-standing structures, larger yard areas, greater setbacks, and 

lower building densities than are permitted in the General Business 

District. 

BG General Business District provides for a wide range of retail land service 

establishments in a central business environment.  Intended to provide 

adequate space in appropriate locations along major streets, thoroughfares 

and at intersections for various types of business use.  These uses should 

include the retailing of major goods and services, general office facilities 

and public functions that would serve a community area of several 

neighborhoods. Development of uses in the district characteristically 

occupies a larger area than in the HSB district because it is intended to 

serve a greater population and to offer a wider range of services.  

Orientation and expansion of this district should occur as an increase in 

depth at major intersections rather than as a strip-like extension along the 

street or thoroughfare.

dust, gas, fumes, odors or radiation and that do not create fire or explosion 

hazards or other objectionable conditions.  This district limits industrial, 

manufacturing and warehousing uses to those which are wholly conducted 

indoors.  The LM district is established to provide a location for those 

heavy commercial and light industrial operations which demonstrate 

characteristics that are able to meet comparatively rigid specifications for 

nuisance-free operation.

warehousing uses to those which are wholly conducted indoors, with the 

exception of outdoor storage which is screened and situated in a required 

side or rear yard.  Comprised of lands that are located on or have ready

Section 608.  Architectural and Design Standards. 

A. COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, OFFICE, INSTITUTIONAL, MANUFACTURING and MULTI-FAMILY DESIGN 

STANDARDS 

1.  Objectives and Findings 

In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within the City of Sugar Hill, the 

City hereby adopts the following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed buildings within RM, 

OI, HSB, BG, LM, HM-1 and HM-2 zoning districts. These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect 

and livability of the entire city. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest, yet achieve and 

maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. 

Each building should be created as an enduring feature of the City’s built and natural environment contributing 

to the productivity of our economy, social/civic network and ecological condition.  The use of quality local 

materials is encouraged in order to minimize the operational and environmental cost over the life of each 

building.  A typical building exterior shall require little maintenance and achieve a life span of at least 80 years.  

Nostalgic replications of any building shall be avoided.   

The use of building materials should create a consistent and traditional architectural identity for each 

building/development.  Traditional architecture may include the use of brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage 

and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth shall be 

provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy and reduce the perceived scale of such a building. 

2.  Grandfathering and Adoption 

The following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed non-residential or         multifamily 

buildings within RM, OI, HSB, BG, LM, HM-1 and HM-2 zoning districts. Any project within the City that has 

received or applied for a building permit by the date of adoption of these requirements shall be allowed to 

proceed under the previous requirements. In addition to applicable provisions outlined in Article VIII of the 

2000 Zoning Ordinance relating to nonconforming uses, any building addition or enlargement to a lawfully 

constructed building shall not be subject to these requirements. 

 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance Article 6 
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia                                                    General Provisions 

 

- 6.5 – 
Amended 03-09-20 

 

 

3.  Building Plans 

All building plans submitted as an application for a building permit should clearly indicate all of the proposed 

building materials and colors for each facade as described herein. The plans should clearly show the location, 

dimensions and calculate the amount/percentages of all building materials per facade.  

The following design standards are primarily based upon the City’s zoning categories. However if a use is 

permitted in a more intensive zoning district, building material allocations shall be used for the less intensive 

classification (e.g. a professional office in a  BG zoning district shall use the building material allocations in Table 

I for OI categories.) 

4.  Definitions 

Arcade: As used herein, an arcade is a covered entry feature /structural canopy extending along the front 

facade of a commercial building. 

Building: Any structure having a roof supported by walls and intended for the shelter, housing or enclosure of 

any individual, process, equipment, goods or materials of any kind. 

Facade: A vertical exterior face or elevation of a building. 

Front facade: Any facade with a public entry which faces a public right-of-way. 

Rear facade: Any facade without a public entry that does not face a public right-of-way.  A rear façade may be 

technically classified as a side façade. 

 

Side facade: Any facade without a public entry but facing a public right-of-way or any facade with a public entry 

but not facing a public right-of-way. A side facade typically connects a front facade with a rear façade. 

5. General Architectural Requirements 

a.  If provided, dumpsters shall be screened to a height of eight feet with an opaque screen on all 

sides.  Screening wall must be finished with brick and/or stone.  All dumpster screens must be arranged for

c. Accent/Trim Exterior Building Material 

Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the 

elevation of the building or for decorative elements but should not exceed 10% of total wall area per 

facade. 

d. Facade Calculations 

With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building 

materials used. When a material is restricted as a percentage in Table I or Table II, such as stucco or 

siding, the building material may not be considered a primary building material or be combined with 

another restricted building material. The allowed facade materials shall not apply to windows, glass-

front windows, entry doors and/or roll-up doors.  The amount of permitted material shall be calculated 

using the gross square footage of wall area per facade. A building material that is allowed (such as brick) 

may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. A material that is restricted (such as stucco 

and split face block) is allowed as a maximum percentage.  For example, a building has a front facade 

with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors.  

Begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. In this case, the front facade of 

a building in BG zoning district with a wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 300 square 

feet of stucco on the front facade [ex. (1,200 X 25% = 300)]. The balance shall be brick or other allowed 

material. 

i. For buildings with less than 15,000 square feet GFA, multi-pane windows shall 

be used in individual window openings, rather than large glass sheets. 

ii. Mirrored glass with a reflection greater than twenty (20%) percent and glass 

curtain walls shall be prohibited. 

iii. For buildings with less than 15,000 square feet GFA, window areas shall not 

extend down to the floor line.  A wall of not less than 2’ in height shall separate the floor from 

the bottom of the window frame. 

iv. Building facades shall be visually divided into segments through articulation of 

the façade achieved by methods such as but not limited to variation in building materials, roof 

line, building setback, the use of additional window bays, pilasters.  The segments shall be 

determined based on the length of the façade as shown:   

Façade Length      Maximum Segment Length 

50’ – 150’     50’ 

151’ – 300’     75’

7. Roof Requirements 

a.  Pitched Roofs 

All one-story buildings less than 10,000 gross square feet must have a pitched roof (between 

3:12 and 12:12).  If a pitched roof is not possible, a combination of flat roof and pitched roof shall be 

required.  Provide a pitched roof on front and side of the building to screen view of any flat roof.  Cover 

arcades, canopies, porches, balconies and other similar features with a pitched roof.  Materials for 

pitched roofs shall be limited to architectural dimensional grade asphalt shingles, natural slate, natural 

terra cotta, natural wood shake, or factory finished enamel metal roofing.  The use of copper enamel 

standing seam metal roofing is the signature treatment for buildings in Downtown Sugar Hill. 

b.  Mansard Roofs 

Mansard roofs shall have a maximum pitch of 12:12 with a minimum 12 foot vertical surface 

length. 

c. Flat Roofs 

Flat roofs may be of any material that meets local codes.  If factory finished metal flashing is 

used the color must be subdued to blend with other materials used in the construction of the roof.  All 

buildings with flat roofs shall include parapet articulation on the front façade(s) of such building. There 

shall be roof articulations/offsets at a minimum of one per each 120 linear feet of length by a change in 

the top line of the parapet.  Additional articulation may occur at any lesser distance. If the front facade 

is less than 120 linear feet, then a minimum of one roof articulation must occur. 

d.  Other 

Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps may have flat roof with vertical or factory formed 

facing of finished sheet metal. 

8. Arcade / Structural Canopy for Retail Commercial Buildings 

For all commercial retail/service buildings, a covered entry shall be provided at the front of the building.  

The arcade or canopy shall provide covered areas for relief from the weather and extend from the 

building a minimum of five feet.  They shall be designed in a manner which adds architectural variation 

and a sense of depth to the façade.   

9. Alternate Review 

This Ordinance is intended to be followed as outlined above. In the event the intent of this Ordinance 

can be achieved with minor deviations which do not substantially impact the goals or intent of this 

Ordinance, the Director of the City of Sugar Hill Department of Planning and Development has the 

authority to modify the specific provisions.  If substantial modifications or changes are necessary, any

ARTICLE 10. 

OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS 

Section 1000.  Planned Unit Developments. 

The purpose of planned unit developments is to encourage the best possible site plans and 
building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation.  The 
developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and 
flexibility in design.  The City gains the advantages of variety in building types, compatibility of uses and 
optimum community development.  Review of the development plan by the Sugar Hill Planning and 
Zoning Commission provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the 
character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. 

The planned unit development is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to 
encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning.  The planned unit development is, furthermore, 
not intended to enhance the value of the property for speculative purposes.  Approval of a planned unit 
development is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one (1) year, and 
pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the Mayor and City Council may, upon written notice 
to the property owner, abolish the Zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of actual 
development. 

A.  Types of Planned Unit Development. 

The following types of planned unit developments are authorized by this Ordinance.  They are required to 
have the minimum acreage indicated: 

1. Planned Residential Development (PRD) – Ten (10) acres. 

2. Senior Residential Development (SRD) – Five (5) acres. 

B.  Ownership Control. 

 The land area of a planned unit development shall be a contiguous land area to consist of all 
property within its exterior boundaries and shall not include any islands.  For purposes of this Section, an 
island is defined as any property in which its aggregate external boundaries abut the surrounding property 
contained in the planned unit development.  Upon application for a PUD, all land within the land area of 
the planned unit development must be owned by the same individual, corporation or other legal entity.  
Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded, with the 
properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as 
originally approved and developed. 
 
C.  Standards Applying to All Planned Unit Developments. 

All planned unit developments shall meet the following standards and such other requirements as 
are set forth with respect to each of the permitted types of planned unit developments: 

1. The development shall be compatible with the topography of the land and shall preserve any 
unusual topographic or natural features. 

2. The development shall not adversely affect developed or undeveloped neighboring properties. 

3. The development shall utilize design and development features that would not be possible by 
the application of lot-by-lot Zoning District regulations. 

4. Water, sewerage, and street facilities shall be adequate for the proposed development or there 
shall be a definite proposal for making them so. 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                                                            Article 10

    Amended 08-10-21 

5. Yards:  The yard requirements of the Zoning District in which the planned unit development is 
located may be waived by the Mayor and Council except along the exterior boundaries of the 
development.  Buffer zone requirements shall be met. 

6. Height:  The height limitation of the Zoning District in which the planned unit development is 
located may be waived by the Mayor and City Council. 

7. Off-street parking and loading and unloading requirements:  The off-street parking and 
loading and unloading requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be met. 

D.  Standards Applying to Planned Residential Developments. 

1. Location.  A planned residential development may be located within any residential Zoning 
District if it meets all the required standards for planned residential developments. 

2. Permitted uses.  A planned residential development may contain single-family detached 
houses, condominiums, attached single-family houses, customary home occupations and 
customary residential accessory building and uses. 

3.  Common open space requirements.  In a residential planned unit development, the lot size may 
be reduced from the general lot size for that district at the discretion of the Mayor and City 
Council.  For all lots in a residential planned unit development the developer shall reserve five 
hundred fifty (550) square feet per lot for open space.  In addition to the five hundred fifty (550) 
square feet per lot, the developer shall reserve an amount of land equivalent to the reduction in 
any lot size for open space to be preserved and maintained for its scenic values, passive 
recreation or conservation purposes.  (Example: Lot size required by underlying zoning district 
is 10,000 sq. ft.  A request for an 8,000 sq. ft. lot requires a set aside of 2,550 sq. ft. of open 
space [2,000 sq. ft. for equal offset from 10,000 sq. ft. plus 550 sq. ft. for the dwelling unit on 
the lot]). 

 
i. The required open space shall not include areas devoted to public or private streets and 

parking areas. 

ii. Up to one-half of the required open space may be located in a 100-year floodplain or an 
existing lake. 

iii. The required open space shall be left in its natural state as passive greenspace unless 
otherwise approved by the City Council. 

iv. If requested by the City, the owner of the planned residential development shall deed to 
the city the land set aside as required open space. 

v. If the City does not require that the land be deeded to it, then the open space shall be 
deeded to a property owner’s association comprised of residents of the planned 
residential development for the benefit of the residents.  The organization of the 
property owner’s association and its adequate financing for the discharge of its 
responsibilities shall be assured through acceptable private deed covenants tied to 
the land. 

vi. In the event the property owner’s association fails to maintain the common open space 
properly, the City may serve written notice upon the property owner’s association 
and upon the residents and owners of the planned residential development setting

forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open 
space in a reasonable condition.  Said notice shall include a demand that such 
deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within thirty (30) days thereof, and shall 
state the date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within fifteen (15) 
days of the notice.  The deficiencies are not corrected within the said thirty (30) 
days, the City, in order to preserve that taxable values of the properties within the 
planned residential development and to prevent the common open space from 
becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and 
maintain the same for one (1) year and thereafter until the property owner’s 
association is prepared to provide proper maintenance.  The cost to such 
maintenance by the City shall be assessed against the properties within the plan 
residential development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space 
and shall become a tax lien upon said properties.   

 
4. General private deed covenants.  The entire planned residential development shall be included 

within private deed covenants tied to the land assuring the continuance of the planned 
residential development in accordance with approved plans and development. 

5. Minimum lot sizes.  The minimum lot sizes of the Zoning District in which the planned 
residential development is located may be waived by the Mayor and Council provided that any 
lot touching the exterior boundary of the development shall meet the minimum frontage and 
minimum square footage requirements for the underlying Zoning District.   

6. Gross density.  Except where noted herein, the overall maximum density of a planned 
residential development shall not exceed the density of the zone in which it is located. 

 

E.  Standards Applying to Senior Residential Development. 

A Senior Residential District (SRD) is designed to serve the housing need of adults who are 55 years 
of age or older. It is recommended that these districts be located in areas that facilitate pedestrian access to 
nearby commercial goods and services, and/or amenities/cultural facilities. These areas are intended to 
function as communities with parks and open spaces.  At least 80% of the occupied units shall be occupied 
by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older.  The other 20% is not intended as a set aside for 
younger residents and efforts should be made to minimize the number of units that do not meet this 
requirement. 

1. Location.  An SRD shall be located within an RS-100 or R36 Zoning District.  

2. Permitted Uses.  Detached or attached single-family homes, villas/town homes, attached 
residences, plus customary residential accessory building and uses.  A combination of these 
housing units may be used, but each type of permitted use must be clustered within the 
development and not randomly situated.  The development plans shall indicate what type of 
housing units are to be located within the development. 

3. Common open space requirements.  No less than twenty-five (25) percent of the site acreage shall 
be set aside as open space, and no more than 50% can be in a Flood Hazard area, as identified 
by Sugar Hill Floodplain Management Ordinance.

the overlay district shall govern. 

 
A. Purpose and Intent 

In preparing a Town Center Master Plan under the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) Livable Centers 
Initiative (LCI) program, the City surveyed its constituents and found that the people of Sugar Hill have 
widely shared values related to protection of the visual environment and enhancement of the pedestrian 
experience Downtown.  Those surveys revealed the community’s collective affinity for traditional 
architecture consistent with late 19th century to early 20th century American styles and the original small 
town feel of business districts from that era.  These regulations are therefore based on the visual sensibilities 
of the average person in the community as well as widely accepted standards for ensuring a universally 
positive experience for Downtown Sugar Hill visitors, residents and businesses.   

Attractive and integrated architectural and urban design features tend to improve an area’s image, raise 
overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, as well as enhance the quality of life.  
Furthermore, visual harm to a widespread pattern of community preference as well as damage to the 
economic, architectural and social infrastructure of the City can occur without the imposition of the 
provisions of this Ordinance, which places limitations on or prohibits altogether certain uses, structures, 
and practices that would be out of harmony or incongruent with the distinctive character or visual features 
of the surrounding area.   



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                                                            Article 10 
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia                       Planned Unit Developments 
 

10.8 
    Amended 08-10-21 

In order to establish a regulatory framework that addresses these issues this section establishes an overlay 
zoning district for Sugar Hill that sets up design standards and a design review process for any new 
construction or material change in exterior appearance to existing structures within the TCO. 
 

B. Exceptions  

Variances shall be processed in accordance with Article 15 of the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Ordinance. 
 

C. Severability  

Any requirement set forth herein deemed unconstitutional, vague, illegal and/or otherwise unenforceable 
in a court of law shall not invalidate the remainder of this Section and all other provisions and requirements 
of this Section shall remain in full force and effect. 
 

D. Use Provisions. 

1.  Maximum Building Height.  Maximum building height shall be 4 stories with a maximum of 50 feet.   

2. Mixed Use.  Mixed uses are encouraged within the TCO.  Refer to Section 1003 Mixed Use 
Developments. 

4.   Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors.  Georgia Highway 20 (Hwy 20) and Peachtree 
Industrial Boulevard (PIB) intersect each other near the western edge of the TCO.  While these 
regionally important arterial roadways create significant challenges for development within the TCO 
they move a large amount of people and goods around Downtown Sugar Hill on a daily basis.  In 
consideration of the heavy volume and higher speeds of vehicular traffic along these corridors 
adequate provisions should be granted to facilitate appropriate commercial development which 
addresses the needs of our traveling consumers while promoting pedestrian oriented development 
patterns within Downtown Sugar Hill.  Therefore, the uses shown below in table 1001.D.4  shall 
only be allowed if  granted a special use permit by the City Council provided that the property abuts 
Hwy 20 or PIB for at least 350 feet of continuous frontage, does not interfere with the safe and 
normal flow of traffic, is not within 1,320 feet of Hillcrest Street, has an existing commercial 
driveway permit from the state or county Department of Transportation, is not within 1,320 feet of a 
similar use along the same direction of travel and meets the specific conditions associated with each 
use as shown in table 1001.D.4.  In addition to the criteria set forth in Article 17 of this Zoning 
Ordinance, in deliberating a special use permit under this section, the Council shall consider the:  

a. Appropriateness of the use based on the development of surrounding properties;  

b. Any benefit or harm to the surrounding properties and the TCO as a result of the use; and 

c. Whether the use is consistent with the intent of the TCO and this section. 

5. Prohibited Uses.  Unless otherwise noted, the following uses shall be prohibited within the TCO: 
Adult entertainment businesses/facilities; automotive sales lots and associated service facilities; 
automobile repair shops and tire stores including lubrication or tune up centers; truck stops; service 
stations; boarding and rooming houses; contractors equipment depot; restaurants with drive-through

of this Ordinance, those uses shall, upon the adoption of this Ordinance become non-conforming 
uses, shall comply with and be governed by Article 8 of the Zoning Ordinance.

10.14 
    Amended 08-10-21 

iv)  As long as the interior arrangement or use will not have any effect on exterior architectural features 
and complies with the standards herein it will not be considered. 

v)  The following are other grounds for considering a design inappropriate. 

- Character foreign to the area. 

- Arresting and spectacular effects. 

- Violent contrasts of material or color, or intense or lurid colors.

Manager, it shall be forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting.  If the 
City Manager fails to accept or reject an application within 30 calendar days of receipt it shall be 
deemed accepted and forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting.  The 
Council may approve the application and direct the City Manager to issue a Certificate of Design 
Review if it finds that the proposed material change in exterior appearance or development would 
not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic or architectural significance and value of 
adjacent and nearby properties, and if the Council finds the application is consistent with the criteria 
for acting on applications above.  The Council may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks 
proper and conditionally approve the application if the applicant agrees to the conditions, or the 
Council may deny the application as submitted.  In the event the Council rejects an application, it 
shall state its reason(s) for doing so and the City Manager shall transmit a record of such action and 
reason(s) for rejection, in writing, to the applicant.  The Council may also table the application or

The following provisions shall apply to all property inside the Central Business District (CBD) as delineated 

on the Central Business District Boundary Map, which is attached as Exhibit 2 and incorporated by reference.   
 
The CBD is an overlay zoning district.  The land use regulations applicable to the Town Center Overlay 

District (TCO), the Central Business District (CBD), as well as the underlying zoning remain in full force and effect

provision hereof is in conflict with the TCO or underlying zone, the provision of the CBD overlay district shall govern. 

 
A. Purpose and Intent 

To further the goals of the Downtown Sugar Hill LCI Study and to foster development of the city center that 
contributes to the function and feel of traditional small town business districts prominent throughout this region during 
the late 19th century to the early 20th century.  To recreate this feeling by using traditional block patterns characterized 
by common side walls, building fronts abutting the sidewalk and on street parking; breaking up large blocks; 
optimizing multi-modal connectivity and incorporating small public gathering spaces.     
In order to establish a regulatory framework that creates this traditional small town urban character; promotes compact 
mixed use growth; supports community development and the need for walkable, pedestrian oriented public and 
commercial spaces; provides incentives and removes barriers to redevelopment, rehabilitation and revitalization of 
vacant and underutilized properties in the area this section establishes an overlay zoning district for Sugar Hill that 
provides for an appropriate mix of uses, establishes standards of development to facilitate urban forms and sets up a 
design review process for any new construction or material change in appearance to existing structures within the 
CBD. 
 

B. Exceptions  

Variances shall be processed in accordance with Article 15 of the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Ordinance. 
 

C. Severability  

Any requirement set forth herein deemed unconstitutional, vague, illegal and/or otherwise unenforceable in a court of 
law shall not invalidate the remainder of this Section and all other provisions and requirements of this Section shall

6. Mixed Use. 

Two or more of the allowed uses, conditional uses and special uses may be present and allowed subject to the 
following restrictions and all other zoning and development requirements unless specifically exempted by this 
Section. No zoning buffers will be required between parcels within the Central Business District or between parcels 
within the Central Business District and parcels directly outside of the boundaries. 

  
a.  Residential or office uses in buildings containing retail or other uses are encouraged and the 

acreage on which such buildings are located may be used in either or both classifications for 
density purposes. 

7. Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors.  The CBD is bounded on two sides by Georgia State Route 20 
(SR20) and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard (PIB).  While these regionally important arterial roadways create 
physical limits to the development and expansion of the CBD they move a large amount of people and goods 
around Downtown Sugar Hill on a daily basis.  In consideration of the heavy volume and higher speeds of 
vehicular traffic along these corridors adequate provisions should be granted to facilitate appropriate 
commercial development which addresses the needs of our traveling consumers while promoting pedestrian 
oriented development patterns within Downtown Sugar Hill.  Therefore, the uses shown below in table 
1002.D.7  shall only be allowed if granted a special use permit by the City Council provided that the property 
abuts Hwy 20 or PIB for at least 350 feet of continuous frontage, does not interfere with the safe and normal 
flow of traffic, is not within 1,320 feet of Hillcrest Street, has an existing commercial driveway permit from 
the state or county Department of Transportation, is not within 1320 feet of a similar use along the same 
direction of travel and meets the specific conditions associated with each use as shown in table 1002.D.7.  In 
addition to the criteria set forth in Article 17 of this Zoning Ordinance, in deliberating a special use permit 
under this section, the Council shall consider the:  

a. Appropriateness of the use based on the development of surrounding properties;  

b. Any benefit or harm to the surrounding properties and the CBD as a result of the use; and 

c. Whether the use is consistent with the intent of the CBD and this section. 

Table 1002.D.7 – Special Uses along Principal Arterial Corridors and Associated Conditions 
 
Use: Conditions: 

1. Convenience store, with or without fuel 
pumps. 

Signs are prohibited on fuel pumps, canopy and other accessory 
structures. 
 
Vehicle washing facility is prohibited. 
 
Fuel pumps and associated canopy shall be located in the side or 
rear yard. 
 
Outdoor display of items for sale are prohibited.

Provide at least one outdoor seat for every five indoor seats or a 
minimum of 12 outdoor seats. 

E.  Design Criteria and Standards.  
These design criteria and standards shall be used to evaluate every development, redevelopment, rehabilitation and 
building project whether new or a change in appearance on all properties located within the boundaries of the CBD. 

 
1. Design Criteria – Physical Relationship to Streetscape:  

 
All forms of ground transportation are important to the urban infrastructure of Downtown Sugar Hill and access 
to all modes to include auto, pedestrian, bus and bicycle should be encouraged.  Providing for transportation 
choices allows our less mobile citizens to get around with dignity and may reduce congestion in and around 
Downtown.   

 
Standards:  
i) All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley access. 

ii) All buildings adjacent to Alton Tucker Blvd and  West Broad St  must align with the sidewalk edge and have 
their principal orientation toward the street except to accommodate features that enhance the pedestrian 
experience and contribute to the character of the streetscape such as outdoor dining areas, exhibition spaces 
for art, gathering space for events or lines such as a ticket window, gardens, courtyards or similar recessed 
features. 

iii) Buildings shall be set back from the right-of-way between zero (0) and twelve (12) feet.  Porches, canopies 
and awnings may extend into the front setback up to six (6) feet but shall not encroach into the right-of-way 
or within 6’ of back of curb.  No front loading attached garages shall be permitted.  All attached garages shall 
be side or rear entry.  Zero (0) foot side setbacks are allowed for attached residential dwellings and 
nonresidential buildings.  Detached residential dwellings shall be subject to the underlying zoning district’s 
setback requirements. 

iv) New structures shall fit in with the surrounding buildings.  Refer to Appendix B for suggested guidelines on 
siting new buildings. 

v)         Large scale single use facilities such as conference spaces, theaters and athletic facilities shall generally 
occur behind or above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.  Such facilities may exceed maximum 
first floor area standards if so sited.  No structure shall exceed 30,000 square feet as a single use. 

vi) Parking structures adjacent to a street shall be oriented with its shortest dimension along the street frontage 
and shall include facilities for commercial or office space at the ground level for at least 50% of the frontage.  
A landscaped pedestrian plaza shall make up any remaining frontage. 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                                                            Article 10 
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia                          Overlay Zoning Districts 
 

10.22 
    Amended 08-10-21 

vii) All development shall coordinate pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns with adjacent buildings and 
sites as well as interconnect with existing adjacent sidewalks.  Where development adjoins undeveloped 
properties, the sidewalk for the new project shall terminate at the property line at a point where the next project 
can continue the sidewalk along the public right-of-way with little difficulty in vertical or horizontal transition. 

viii) Access connections shall be required where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to important 
civic uses such as churches, schools, parks, transportation and other critical community facilities. 

ix) Mechanical and electrical equipment, solar collectors, satellite dishes, dumpsters, compactors, storage tanks, 
utility meters, valves, vents and other similar equipment shall be located to the rear of the building or otherwise 
concealed from public street view. 

x) Adjacent to public streets and dedicated pedestrian walkways, chain link, razor wire, barbed wire, corrugated 
metal, plastic, exposed concrete and exposed concrete block walls and fences are prohibited. 

xi) Walls and fences shall have vertical articulation at least every 40 linear feet. 

 
2. Design Criteria – Pedestrian Experience:  

 
Providing a visual connection to the civic uses from the commercial uses inside each building and more private 
uses on upper floors may increase the level of awareness and self-policing among the users of Downtown Sugar 
Hill.  This additional interaction will contribute to the sense of safety for the pedestrian community, residents 
and business owners.  

 
Standards:  

i) Building facades longer than 40 feet shall be visually divided into segments of no more than 20 feet through 
articulation of the façade achieved through methods such as but not limited to architectural recesses, breaks in 
materials, additional window bays, variation in roof line, and building setback. 

ii) Streetscape elements such as benches, trash receptacles, fencing and/or bike racks shall match the finish, style, 
design, material and quality of the approved City of Sugar Hill streetscape elements found in Appendix A, which 
is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  Dining tables and chairs in outdoor seating areas shall 
be maintained clean and in good condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance.  All metal and wood 
furniture shall be finished to preserve their natural color or match colors from the exterior color palettes shown 
in Appendix A.  Wood furniture may be stained to preserve their natural texture and color.  All other furniture 
shall match the exterior color palettes shown in Appendix A. 

iii) A lighting plan for the site including standard data and design details showing location, character and light 
coverage shall be approved by the City Manager.  Proposed lighting appurtenances must be visually compatible 
with the approved City of Sugar Hill street lights found in Appendix A. 

iv) A minimum of 50% of the street facing facades on the ground level shall be transparent through windows and 
doors.   

v) A minimum of 40% of all facades on the upper floors shall contain windows or balconies.       

vi) Reflective or glass tinted more than 30% is not permitted.  No glass may be more than 30% opaque.  

vii) Awnings, canopies or overhangs shall be integrated into the building design for all pedestrian ways.

10.23 
    Amended 08-10-21 

viii) Awnings or similar type structures must be constructed of durable, protective and water repellant materials.  
Plastic or fiberglass awnings are not permitted.  

ix) Awnings must project a minimum of 42” from the building and are limited to segments of eight feet (8’) in length.  

x) Awnings may serve as sign panels for businesses provided the total sign area on the awning is included in the 
calculations for the wall signs on the associated façade. 

xi) Discharge of water along the surface of a walkway is prohibited.  e.g. storm water from gutters, condensate from 
air conditioning units, etc. 

xii) All new or relocated utilities shall be placed underground. 

xiii) Dumpsters shall be screened on all sides by a minimum six-foot high brick or stone wall with access via an opaque

sidewalks and neighboring uses. 

xv) Sidewalk displays related to a licensed business shall only be permitted directly in front of the subject business 
location and shall not project into the sidewalk more than three (3) feet and shall not otherwise obstruct pedestrian 
or ADA accessible travel ways. 

xvi) Maximum block length = 500’. 

 
3. Design Criteria – Vehicular and Pedestrian Access:  

 
Vehicular access and parking should be adequate while serving to enhance the overall pedestrian experience.  
Size and location of off street parking lots should be small and limited to the rear of the businesses they serve.  

 
Standards:  

i) Sidewalks are required on all streets except for alleys.  

ii) Sidewalks adjacent to Alton Tucker Boulevard and West Broad Street shall be 15 feet in width. 

iii) All other sidewalks shall be at least six (6) feet wide.  

iv) A combination of off-street, on-street (10% Max.) and shared parking (10% Max.) may be used for off-street 
parking requirements as long as no required parking space is more than 700 feet from an entrance to the 
building, unit, suite and/or space it serves. 

v) Except parking structures, off street parking areas should not abut the street and/or sidewalk. 

vi) All development shall accommodate ADA accessible, safe and continuous pedestrian walkways to and 
through parking areas.

standing sign structure, which is not permanently anchored to the ground, consisting of two sign faces set up 
back to back in a triangle shape. For the purposes of this Section a display board is defined as a wall sign.  
Commercial buildings located at the street level may display either a sandwich board or display board without 
the requirement of a permit, subject to Section 1309 Maintenance and Appearance.  Such sign must be located 
within ten (10) feet of the business entrance and shall provide a clear path of at least five (5) feet along the

submitted with the application. 

 
4. Criteria for Acting on Design Review Applications 

In reviewing applications for design review, the Council shall consider the appropriateness of the design of any 
building or any proposed material change in exterior appearance in the context of the following criteria: 

i)  Consistency with any adopted design guidelines for the type of development, and/or the proposed use.   

ii)  The nature and character of the surrounding areas, and the consistency and compatibility of the proposed 
application with such nature and character.  



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                                                            Article 10 
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia                          Overlay Zoning Districts 
 

10.26 
    Amended 08-10-21 

iii)  The general design, character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, texture, 
materials, and colors of the structure in question and the relation of such elements to similar features of 
structures in the immediate surrounding area, site, and landscaping. 

iv)  As long as the interior arrangement or use will not have any effect on exterior architectural features and 
complies with the standards herein it will not be considered. 

v)  The following are other grounds for considering a design inappropriate. 
- Character foreign to the area. 

- Arresting and spectacular effects. 

- Violent contrasts of material or color, or intense or lurid colors. 

- A multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance.  

- The absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character 
of the present structure or surrounding area. 

 
5. Action by the Council 

Once a Certificate of Design Review application is determined complete and is accepted by the City Manager, 
it shall be forwarded to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting.  If the City Manager fails 
to accept or reject an application within 30 calendar days of receipt it shall be deemed accepted and forwarded 
to the Council for consideration at its next scheduled meeting.  The Council may approve the application and 
direct the City Manager to issue a Certificate of Design Review if it finds that the proposed material change in 
exterior appearance or development would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic or architectural 
significance and value of adjacent and nearby properties, and if the Council finds the application is consistent 
with the criteria for acting on applications above.  The Council may suggest alternative courses of action it 
thinks proper and conditionally approve the application if the applicant agrees to the conditions, or the Council 
may deny the application as submitted.  In the event the Council rejects an application, it shall state its reason(s) 
for doing so and the City Manager shall transmit a record of such action and reason(s) for rejection, in writing, 
to the applicant.  The Council may also table the application or request more information.  The applicant, if he 
or she desires, may make modifications to the plan(s) and may resubmit the application.

Amended 10/11/2021



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                                                            Article 10 
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia                          Overlay Zoning Districts 
 

10.28 
    Amended 08-10-21 

Section 1003. MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS 
 
A.  Intent and Purpose. 
The Mixed Use Development Districts are established for the following purposes: 
 
1. To encourage larger scale mixed use development which will produce a logically 
organized and compatible set of land uses resulting in a higher overall quality of development 
than if accomplished in incremental unplanned stages. 

 
2. To allow a mixture and/or density of land uses not otherwise allowed in an established 
zoning district; by careful site planning the appropriate site improvements are incorporated into 
the plan that establish compatible relationships between uses within the site and uses adjacent to 
the site. 

 
3. To encourage creative site design which seeks to preserve the open space and unique 
environmental features, conserve energy through efficient building design and clustering, 
efficiently use the land, and increase the efficiency of public service delivery. 

 
4. To be applied in a manner consistent with the Land Use Plan for the City of Sugar Hill. 

B. General Conditions. 
An area may be considered for rezoning to a Mixed Use Development District if any one of the 
following conditions exists: 
 
1. The characteristics of the specific site plan and uses proposed for the subject property 
would only be compatible with the surrounding area if the development were limited to those 
plans and uses as submitted. 

 
2. Separate land uses, which would not otherwise be permitted to locate within the same 
zoning district, are proposed for development on one or more adjacent parcels under single 
ownership. 

 
3. Exceptions or variation from the size, setback, frontage, density, uses or other standards 
which are required in the conventional zoning districts are being proposed as a part of a planned 
development. 

 
 
 
 
 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                                                            Article 10 
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia                          Overlay Zoning Districts 
 

10.29 
    Amended 08-10-21 

C.  Uses Within a Mixed Use Development. 
Any use allowable inherently or by City Council approval in the conventional zoning districts set 
forth herein may be proposed for inclusion in Mixed Use Development.  Each proposed use 
should be consistent in application with the intent and purpose of the conventional zoning 
districts in which it is allowed.  Only the specific uses proposed in an application and approved 
shall be allowed in the district.  Any addition of uses, change of plans, or increase in size or 
density shall require a separate amendment to the original approved Mixed Use Development 
and shall follow the same administrative process as any other amendment.  Initial approval of a 
Mixed Use Development by the City of Sugar Hill does not mean that subsequent amendments 
to that Mixed Use Development carry any requirement to be approved.  Unless otherwise stated 
in this section, the development standards and land uses which are presented with an application 
for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and as such 
shall become a part of these zoning regulations.

Department of Transportation or the Georgia Department of Transportation for 
safety reasons and which do not affect the general street layout or number of 
access points to the development, and minor adjustments to layout required as a 
result of engineering data not available at the time of the approval of the plan by 
the Mayor and Council and which does not significantly change the development 
or adversely impact any adjacent properties.  Any major changes in the 
development and the site plan approved as part of the approval of the 
development shall be resubmitted to the Mayor and Council as a zoning change 
and shall require approval of the Mayor and Council.  Major changes include, but 
are not limited to, reductions in lot sizes, changes in the wording of any zoning 
conditions specifically approved by the Mayor and Council, increase in density or 
the number of lots; street modifications that would affect adjacent properties, 
change the basic street structure of the development or change the number of 
entry or exits to the development, or other changes deemed by the Director of 
Planning and Development to constitute major changes. 

2.  A site plan shall be incorporated into each ordinance approving a Mixed Use 
Development and shall be a condition of zoning.  Any changes to the site plan 
which constitute a major change as described above shall constitute a change in 
zoning and shall require a submittal to the Mayor and Council.  If changes are 
made at the time of approval of the zoning which require changes to the site plan 
submitted and reviewed by the Mayor and Council, the Mayor and Council may 
provide in its ordinance for the necessary changes to be made and submitted to the 
City Manager for approval.  Upon such approval by the City Manager, a copy of 
the revised and approved site plan shall be submitted to the Mayor and Council at

SIGNS 

Section 1300. Purpose and Intent. 

It is hereby declared that the aesthetic and safety interests of the City of Sugar Hill are 
reasonably promoted by the provisions of this article.  Accordingly, it is the intent and purpose of 
this article to provide for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community; to 
avoid the erection of displays which produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent 
properties and to the natural beauty of the environment; to provide for the safety of the traveling 
public by limiting distractions, hazards, and obstructions; to minimize visual clutter and 
encourage a positive visual environment within the City; and to promote the mental and physical 
health, safety, and welfare of the public. 

The regulations and requirements herein set forth shall be the minimum requirements to promote 
the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the public and to protect the character of the 
City of Sugar Hill. 

The purpose and intent of these regulations is to create the legal framework for a comprehensive 
and balanced system of signage to improve and enhance the aesthetic environment of the City 
and to avoid the visual clutter that is potentially harmful to traffic and to the appearance of the 
community.  The City Council of the City of Sugar Hill finds that the regulations set forth herein 
will improve the visual appearance of the City by limiting the number and size of signs within 
the corporate limits, consistent with constitutional guarantees, while continuing to provide an 
effective means of communication.

issued, provided no electrical connections are disturbed or modified and the size or weight of the 
sign is not increased.

ARTICLE 13.5. 

 
STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAE AND TOWERS 

 
 
SECTION 1351. PURPOSES.  This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the 
interests of the residents of the City of Sugar Hill, telecommunications providers, and 
telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the 
City of Sugar Hill so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential 
neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a 
competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably 
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and shall not prohibit or 
have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to 
promote the City of Sugar Hill as a proactive city in the availability of wireless 
telecommunications service.  To that end, this ordinance shall: 
 

A. Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications 
facilities to serve the residents and businesses of the City of Sugar Hill; 

 
B. Protect the City of Sugar Hill’s built and natural environment by promoting 

compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
 
C. Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful 

design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
 
D. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure 

through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures 
and antennae; 

 
E. Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to 

minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of 
towers throughout the City; 

 
F. Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as 

a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
 
G. Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas 

which are not zoned for residential use. 
 
SECTION 1352.  DEFINITIONS.  As used in this ordinance, terms shall have the 
meanings indicated in Article 3 of the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Ordinance. 
 
SECTION 1353.  EXCLUSIONS.  The following shall be exempt from this ordinance:

SECTION 1354.  PLACEMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BY 
ZONING DISTRICT. 
 

A. In Light Industrial (HM-1) and Heavy Industrial (HM-2) zoning districts 
telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right.  
Telecommunications towers are permitted as a use by right up to a height of  120 
feet following design review  and approval by the Director.  Telecommunications 
towers greater than 120 feet in height shall require a Special Use Permit.  An 
additional 20 feet may be allowed by right for towers, which provide proof of 
three (3) or more companies locating on the same tower. 

 
B. In General Business (BG) and Light Manufacturing (LM) zoning districts 

antennas shall be allowed as a use by right on existing structures.  New towers 
and antennas greater than seventy (70) feet in height shall be allowed if permitted 
by a Special Use Permit approved by the City Council following design review by 
the Director.  Monopole towers up to a height of seventy (70) feet shall be 
permitted.

of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia              Telecommunications Antennae 
    And Towers                       

13.5.3 
 
 

 
C. In Highway Service Business (HSB) and Office-Institutional (OI) zoning districts, 

telecommunications facilities greater than fifty (50) feet shall be allowed if 
permitted by a Special Use Permit approved by the City Council following design 
review by the Director.  Telecommunications towers fifty (50) feet or less are 
permitted. 

 
D. Except as set forth in this section or listed as an “exclusion” in Section 1353, 

A.,B,C,E,F,G of this Ordinance, telecommunication facilities shall not be 
permitted in Low Density Single Family Residential (RS-150, RS-175, RS-200, 
PUD), Medium Density Single Family Residential (RS-100), Residential Multi 
Family (RM), or Mobile Home Park (MH) zoning districts . Telecommunications 
facilities shall be allowed only if the applicant provides evidence that such 
placement is a technological necessity in order for the applicant to be in 
compliance with federal law; upon such evidence, such use shall be allowed if 
approved with a Special Use Permit by the City Council following design review 
by the Director. 

 
E. Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be 

built upon approval of a Special Use Permit except for variances to the Zoning 
Ordinance setbacks for a specific zoning district which shall be presented to the 
Zoning Board of Appeals unless the request is part of a Special Use Permit 
application which is presented to the City Council. 

 
SECTION 1355. PREFERRED LOCATION SITES. 

 
A.   Publicly used structures: Publicly used structures are preferred locations 

throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are 
dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses 
are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications 
facilities.  Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable 
when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or 
residential structures.  Publicly used structures include facilities such as police or 
fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility 
structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, 
hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 

  
B.   Co-Location Sites: Any existing site on which a legal wireless 

telecommunications facility is currently located shall be a Preferred Location Site 
regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, 
that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting 
components of this ordinance and co-location sites shall not become an “antenna 
farm” or otherwise be deemed by the Director or the governing authority to be 
visually obtrusive. 

 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                             Article 13.5 Standards for  
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia              Telecommunications Antennae 
    And Towers                       

13.5.4 
 
 

C.   Industrial and Commercial Structures: Wholly industrial and commercial 
structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, 
garages, or service stations shall be Preferred Locations particularly where 
existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will 
be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications system. 

 
D.  Mixed Use Buildings in Planned Development Districts: Mixed use buildings 

(housing above commercial or other non-residential space) are also Preferred 
Location sites.  

 
SECTION 1356.  REQUIREMENTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. 
 

A. General Requirements for All Telecommunications Facilities: The requirements 
set forth in this Section shall govern the location and construction of all 
telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance.   

 
1. Building Codes and Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity of 

telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility 
shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in 
applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such 
telecommunications facilities that are published by the FCC as amended from 
time to time.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic 
inspections of such facilities at least once every three years to ensure 
structural integrity.  Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer 
licensed to practice in Georgia.  The results of such inspection shall be 
provided to the Director. 

 
2. Regulatory Compliance:  All telecommunications facilities must meet or 

exceed current standards and regulations of  the FAA, the FCC and any other 
agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate 
communications towers and antennae.  If such standards and regulations are 
changed then  the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by 
this ordinance shall bring such communications towers and antennae into 
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date 
established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 

 
3. Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be enclosed by decay-

resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be 
equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.  This requirement may be 
waived by the Director if it is deemed that this would produce negative visual 
clutter or obstruct a view corridor. 

 
4. Lighting: No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless 

part of  a approved public lighting program or required by the FCC, FAA or 
other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the

Director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design 
that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 

 
5. Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. 

 
6. Visual Impact: 

 
a. Telecommunications facilities shall, subject to applicable standards of the 

FAA or other federal or state agencies, be maintained with a galvanized 
metal finish, painted a neutral color, or painted and/or textured to match 
the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.  
Telecommunications facilities located in residentially zoned areas shall be 
painted in a neutral color or textured to match the existing environment to 
minimize visual obtrusiveness.  If federal or state regulations require, 
telecommunication facilities shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or 
other required finish. 

  
b. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower and is generally 

visible to the public, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical 
equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to , or closely 
compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the 
antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.  Roof 
mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to 
match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers, or other 
background. 

 
c.  Antennas mounted on architecturally significant structures or significant 

architectural details of the building shall be covered by appropriate 
casings, which are manufactured to match existing architectural features 
found on the building. 

 
d. Where feasible, antennas can be placed directly above, below or 

incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in 
camouflaging. 

 
e. Towers or roof mounted antennas shall not be placed in direct line with 

significant view corridors, as designated by the City of Sugar Hill or by 
any state or federal law or agency.  For purposes of this ordinance a 
significant view corridor shall be defined as an area to be kept free of 
obstructions or structures which interfere with the view of any scenic area, 
or historic building or area.  A view corridor shall be established by 
ordinance of the City of Sugar Hill, by zoning restrictions adopted in 
accordance with the ordinances of the City of Sugar Hill, or by any state 
or federal law or agency in accordance with provisions of federal laws or 
duly adopted regulations.

    And Towers                       

13.5.6 
 
 

 
f. Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view or 

made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or 
placed underground.  Equipment shelters shall be screened from public 
view and may use landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the 
surrounding structures.  The shelter or cabinet must be regularly 
maintained. 

 
7. Landscaping: 

 
a. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower 

compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential 
property. 

 
b. Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical 

extent.  The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant 
vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that 
lost. 

 
c. The Director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where 

lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security 
purposes or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or 
forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms.  In certain locations 
where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote 
agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the 
landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the Director.   

 
8. Maintenance Impacts.  Equipment at a transmission facility shall be 

automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion.  
Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for 
maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street.  
Access drives and maintenance vehicle parking shall be paved unless the 
requirement is waived by the Director. 

 
9. Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses: 

 
a. Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but 

not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage.  Mobile 
or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall 
not be stored or parked on the site of the tower. 

 
b. Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the 

same build able area.  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or 
existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                             Article 13.5 Standards for

13.5.7 
 
 

flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, 
natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 

 
10. Lot Size and Setbacks: 

 
a. The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate 

setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a 
residential district, public property, or public street.  Such setback shall be 
sufficient to: 

 
(1) Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as 

required in Section 1356 (A)(7); 
 
(2) Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; and 
 
(3) Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure 

by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based 
on the engineer’s analysis required in Section 1357 (B)(1)(d.)(iv.). 

 
11. The proposed project must not disrupt the overall community character.  For 

purposes of this ordinance, the term overall community character shall be 
determined by applying the criteria set forth in Section 1707 of Article 17 of 
the Zoning Ordinance of  the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia. 

 
B. Additional Requirements for Towers: 

 
1. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the 

surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible.  
Wireless communication towers shall be integrated through location and 
design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent 
practical (i.e. camouflaging through integration with structures or appearance 
such as artificial trees, etc.). 

  
2. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of 

the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would 
result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 

 
3. At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the 

extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that 
will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.  
(i.e. artificial tree appearance, steeples, decorative fencing, etc.) 

 
4. Towers greater than 70 feet in height shall not be located any closer than 1500 

feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually 



The 2000 Zoning Ordinance                             Article 13.5 Standards for  
of the City of Sugar Hill, Georgia              Telecommunications Antennae 
    And Towers                       

13.5.8 
 
 

preferable as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals through a variance 
request. 

 
5. When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the 

nearest residential lot line a distance equal to one hundred and thirty-three 
percent (133%) its total height. 

 
6. Towers shall not be sited where they will create visual clutter or negatively 

affect specific view corridors as designated by the City of Sugar Hill or any 
state or federal law or agency. 

 
7. Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided 

requirement number 4 above is met along with all setback, design and 
landscape requirements as to each tower.  Structures may be located as close 
to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of 
the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one 
fails. 

 
SECTION 1357.  APPLICATION PROCEDURES. 
 

A. Special Use Permits: 
 

1. A request for a Special Use Permit shall be initiated by application to the 
Director and handled in accordance with the Special Use Permit provision of

SECTION 1361.  REMOVAL OF ANTENNAE AND TOWERS.  All 
telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained 
in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such 
facilities.  If upon inspection by the Director or his designee any such 
telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the minimum Standard 
Building Code or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being 
provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is 
different, such owners shall have thirty (30) days to bring such facility into compliance.  
In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within thirty 
(30) days, the City may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications 
facility to be removed.  In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed 
within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the City may remove such facility and 
place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal or seek costs incurred through 
court action.  Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City’s 
right to take action.  The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that 
telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the minimum Standard Building 
Code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into 
compliance or removed.  The City may seek to have the telecommunications facility

SECTION 1362.  ABANDONED TOWERS. 
 

A. Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 
twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or 
operator intends to make use of it or any part of it.  The owner of a 
telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is 
located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications 
facility.  If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within sixty (60) days of 
receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the 
City may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for 
the costs of  removal or seek costs incurred through court action.  The City may 
pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned 
telecommunications facilities are removed.  Delay by the City in taking action 
shall not in any way waive the City’s right to take action.  The City may seek to 
have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owners’ or 
operator’s intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, 
federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

SECTION 1363.  PRE-EXISTING TOWERS/NON-CONFORMING USE. 
 

A. All telecommunications facilities operative on the effective date of this ordinance 
shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a non-conforming use and shall 
be treated as a non-conforming use in accordance with Article 8 of the Zoning 
Ordinance of the City of Sugar Hill.  Routine maintenance, including replacement 
with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on 
such existing telecommunications facilities.  New construction other than routine 
maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance.  The Director 
may approve the addition of twenty (20) feet to any existing tower whereby it can 
be shown that this would provide for co-location and eliminate the need for a new 
tower and it is determined that adequate site area exists for the location of any 
equipment buildings.  Approval of an additional twenty (20) feet applies to all 
zoning districts, however, additions greater than twenty (20) feet shall require a 
Special Use Permit. 

 
B. A telecommunications facility that has received City approval in the form of 

either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed 
or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility 
so long as such approval is current and not expired. 

 
C. Placement of an antenna on a non-conforming structure shall not be considered an 

expansion of the non-conforming structure. 
 
SECTION 1364.  COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL LAW.  Whenever the Governing 
Authority finds that the application of this ordinance would unreasonably discriminate 
among providers of functionally equivalent services or prohibit or have the effect of 
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a Special Use Permit waiving any 
or all of the provisions of this ordinance may be granted.   
 
SECTION 1365. SEVERABILITY. 
 

A. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for 
any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, 
such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and 
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

ARTICLE 15. 

VARIANCES AND APPEALS 

Section 1501.  Power to Hear Appeals and Grant Variances 

The Council shall have the following powers: 

1. To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, 
decision or determination made by the City Manager in the enforcement of this Zoning 
Ordinance or the Construction/Building and Technical Codes adopted by the City Council. 

2. To hear and decide requests for Special Exceptions of the Zoning Ordinance. 

3. To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variances from the terms of the Zoning 
Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a 
literal enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary 
hardship, so that the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and 
welfare secured and substantial justice done.  Such variances may be granted in such 
individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Council that: 

a. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular 
property in question because of its size, shape or topography, or 

b. The application of the Ordinance to this particular piece of property would create 
an unnecessary hardship, or 

c. Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 

d. Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner, and 

e. Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor 
impair the purposes or intent of this Ordinance. 

No variance may be granted for a condition of zoning required by the City Council in 
approving a rezoning application; a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by 
this Ordinance; or to permit a use which would result in a greater intensity of development 
on a property than would otherwise be allowed if no variance were involved. 

4. In exercising the above powers, the Council may, in conformity with the provision of this 
Ordinance, reverse decisions or determinations from which the appeal is taken and, to that 
end, shall have all the powers of the City Manager from whom the appeal is taken and may 
issue or revoke or direct the issuance or revocation of a Building or other permit.

15.2 

Section 1502.  Appeals 

Appeals to the Council may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any official of the City affected by 
any decision of the City Manager.  Such appeal shall be taken within fifteen days after the decision 
appealed from by filing with the City Manager and with the City Clerk a Notice of Appeal specifying the 
grounds thereof.  The City Manager shall forthwith transmit to the City Council all the papers 
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 

An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the City Manager 
certifies to the City Council that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, 
cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such a case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than 
by Order of the Councilor by a restraining order granted by a court of record on application and notice 
to the City Manager for good cause shown. 

 

Section 1503.  Required Public Hearings 

Before the Council acts upon an application for a Variance or a Special Exception, it shall hold a public 
hearing thereon.  The notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least 15 days 
prior to the hearing in the official organ of the City.  At the hearing any party may appear in person or by 
agent or attorney. 

In addition, the City shall erect in a conspicuous place on the property involved a sign which shall 
contain information as to the Variance or Special Exception applied for and the time and place of 
hearing.  Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified above shall not invalidate the subsequent 
determination provided the required notice has been published. 

 

Section 1504.  Reapplication  

If an application for a Special Exception or Variance is denied by the Council, a reapplication for such 
Special Exception or Variance may not be made earlier than 12 months from the date of the original 
application, except as provided in Section 1701. 

 

Section 1505.  Appeals from Decisions  

Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the Council under the powers 
granted in this Article may present an Appeal to the Superior Court.  Such an Appeal to the Superior 
Court shall be By Writ of Certiorari as specified in the official Code of Georgia except, however, that 
the Appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision of the Council.  Upon 
failure to file the appeal within thirty (30) days, the decision of the City Council shall be final.

Section 1700. Zoning Ordinance and Map Amendment Procedure.   

A. This Ordinance, including the City of Sugar Hill Zoning Maps, may be amended from time

of the forty-day period. 

C. Before the Planning Commission or the City Council of the City of Sugar Hill enact an

forty-five days prior to the date of each such hearing, the City Council shall cause to be 
published within the official organ of the City, a notice of the hearing.  The notice shall state

petition shall be submitted by the owner of record of said property, the owner's agent or by a 
contract purchaser with the owner's written consent. 

Any amendment request brought before the City Council by petition of any property owner,

of hearing by the City of Sugar Hill City Council, unless the petition was allowed to be 
withdrawn by The  City of Sugar Hill Council at the public hearing.

development or other similar permit, for the affected property shall be accepted until final 
action is taken by the City Council on the proposed map amendment.  Provided, however, 
that if the City Council does not take final action on the proposed map amendment within 
six (6) months from the date of initiation, Permit applications shall again be accepted and 
reviewed pursuant to existing zoning.  And, further provided that such permit applications 
shall be accepted during the map amendment process if the proposed use is authorized under 
the same conditions in both the existing and proposed Zoning District.

Hill which contains less than five acres and the requested use of the annexed property is the 
same as the existing use of said property, a rezoning involving a request for RS100, RS150, 
RS175, or RS200 which will result in the development of less than three individual building 
lots, and a rezoning for a non residential zoning classification in which the property that is

17.7 

Such conditions: 

1. Shall only be valid if they are included in the motion approving the amendment for 
adoption; 

2. Shall be in effect for the period of time specified in the amendment; 

3. Shall be required of the property owner and all subsequent owners as a condition of 
their use of the property; and 

4. Shall be interpreted and continually enforced by the City Manager in the same manner 
as any other provision of this Ordinance. 

 
Section 1706.  Special Use Permits.   

The Special Use Permit is designed to be used when: 

a. A Special Use listed under the Zoning District is desired for development and a more 
intensive Zoning District which contains that use as a use by right would not be 
appropriate for the property, or, 

b. A Special Use listed under the Zoning District is desired for development and no 
Zoning District contains that use as a use by right, or, 

c. A unique use not addressed in any Zoning District is desired for development and is 
not likely to be duplicated within City of Sugar Hill, or, 

d. The density of development may be affected by the height of a building, or, 

e. The neighboring properties may be affected by the height of any structure, and, 

f. The Special Use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood or the 
community as a whole, be compatible with the neighborhood and would not be in 
conflict with the overall objective of the Comprehensive Plan. 

Section 1707. Special Use Permit Procedure.   

In order to accommodate Special Uses, the Special Use Permit allows the City Council to 
approve a Special Use on a particular parcel without changing the general Zoning District.  Such 
approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth below and any additional conditions 
deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the Special Use with the surrounding properties.  
All Special Use Permit applications shall be for firm development proposals only.  The Special 
Use Permit shall not be used for securing early zoning for conceptual proposals which may not 
be undertaken for some time.  A Special Use Permit application shall be considered only if it is 
made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent.  The minimum requirements for a 
Special Use Permit are: 

1. Any uses permitted under a Special Use Permit shall also conform to the requirements 
of this Ordinance and the Development Regulations for the use as found in the Zoning 
District.

17.8 

2. The application and review process for a Special Use Permit shall be the same as for 
the Zoning District under which the Special Use is found.  In addition to the 
information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed 
development, additional information deemed necessary by the City Manager in order to 
evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted.  
In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to the evaluation of the 
characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to its immediate neighborhood and 
the compatibility of the proposed use with its neighborhood. 

 
3. In the approval process for a Special Use Permit application, the City Council shall 

consider the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, particularly in 
relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential 
adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially in regards but not limited to 
traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities. 

4. If an application is approved and a Special Use Permit is granted, all conditions which 
may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property.  All subsequent 
development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan 
and conditions.  Once established, the Special Use shall be in continuous operation.  
Upon discovery that the operation of the Special Use has or had ceased for a period of 
90 days or more and the owner of the property has not requested voluntary termination 
of the Special Use Permit, the City Manager shall forward a report to the City Council 
through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to 
remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 

5. Changes to a Special Use, or development of a site for the Special Use, shall be 
treated as an amendment to the Special Use Permit and shall be subject to the same 
application and review process as a new application. 

6. The Special Use for which a Special Use Permit is granted shall commence operations

use which may be operated by a lessee under a private agreement with a lessor in any

may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the 
property.

Appendix D. Inactive Zoning Districts  

Section D-10: This appendix is provided as reference for projects in zoning districts that have been 
retired with adoption of an amendment to the zoning ordinance. No new zoning application, or variance 
applications, will be accepted for a retired zoning district, however, properties governed by these pre-
existing zoning classifications may continue to be developed in accordance with the use provisions and 
dimensional standards outlined in this appendix.  

Residential Multi-Family (RM) – Retired 10/22/2020  

Section D-20  

Residential Multi-Family District provides for multi-unit structures which are attached housing at  a net 
density not to exceed eight (8) units per acre, and high-density single family residential, providing eight

development is appropriate. The regulations for this district are designed to provide an area where 
individuals and families may establish homes in an environment which satisfies their needs for 
convenience and economy.  

This zoning district is to be located where public water supply and waste water treatment  facilities are 
available or can be obtained and where there is convenient access to collector streets, major
