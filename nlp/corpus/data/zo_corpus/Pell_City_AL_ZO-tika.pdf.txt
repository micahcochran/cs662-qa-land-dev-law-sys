this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.  A variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall 
not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:

4. That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that 

is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 
 
In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards 
in conformity with this Ordinance.  Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the 
terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance.

conformity with the terms of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,

Administrative Official from whom the appeal is taken. 
 
The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,

this Ordinance may require action and decisions by the said Board of Adjustment, only the appeals taken 
in the manner and form as provided in this Ordinance will be considered and acted upon by the said 
Board of Zoning Adjustment.  However, any interested party who is aggrieved by any action or decision of 
the said Board of Adjustment may take an appeal there from to a court of law, as provided for in the State 
Law. 
 
 
SECTION 404.  APPEALS FROM ACTION OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.   
 
Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision of the board may, within fifteen (15) days thereafter

appeal specifying the judgment or decision from which appeal is taken.  In case of such appeal, the board 
shall cause a transcript of the proceedings in the cause to be certified to the court to which the appeal is 
taken and the cause in such court shall be tried de novo.   
 
The City of Pell City hereby appoints a Zoning Board of Adjustment.  This Board shall in appropriate 
cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards make special exceptions to the terms of this

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 50 Article VII.  Boundaries and Establishment of Districts 

A R T I C L E  V I I  
 

B O U N D AR I E S  A N D  E S T AB L I S H M E N T  O F  D I S T R I C T S  
 
 
This article provides for the definition of district boundaries and the establishment of districts for the 
various uses of land within the City. 
 
 
SECTION 701. BOUNDARIES OF DISTRICTS. 
 
The boundaries of the districts are established as shown on the Zoning Map of the municipality.  Unless 
otherwise shown on said Zoning Map, the boundaries of districts are lot lines, the center lines of streets or 
alleys or such lines extended, railroad right-of-way lines, or the corporate limit lines as they existed at the 
time of enactment of this Ordinance. 
 
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps the following rules shall 
apply: 
 

1. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley lines, or platted 
lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 

 
2. In subdivided property or tracts, where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such 

boundaries, unless some are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the 
scale appearing on such maps. 

 
3. Where boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center lines or 

street lines of streets or to the center lines or alley lines of alleys, or to the center lines or 
right-of-way lines of highways, such, boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto 
and at such distance there from as indicated on the Zoning Maps.  If no distance is given, 
such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the said maps. 

 
4. In case any further uncertainty exists, the Board of Adjustment shall determine the location of 

boundaries.  The Board of Adjustment may also cause to be prepared sectional maps of any 
part of the City which will interpret the exact location of the district boundaries, following the 
guidelines contained in the preceding paragraphs. 

 
 
SECTION 702. DISTRICTS. 
 
In order to classify, regulate, and restrict the locations of trades, industries, and the location of buildings 
designed for specific uses, to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or 
structurally altered, to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of the lot areas, and to regulate and 
determine the areas of yards, courts, and other open spaces within and surrounding such buildings, the 
City of Pell City, Alabama, is hereby divided into districts, of which there shall be: 
 

R-A Residence Agricultural District 
R-E Residence Estate District 
R-1 Low Density Residential District 
R-1MH Single Family and Manufactured Home Residential District 
R-2 Medium Low-Density Residential District 
R-3 Medium Density Residential District 
R-4 High Density Residential District 
P-R Planned Residential District 
R-MHP Residential Manufactured Home Park District 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 51 Article VII.  Boundaries and Establishment of Districts 

O-1 Office Building District 
B-1 Neighborhood Business District 
B-2 General Business District 
B-3 Heavy Business District 
M-1 Light Manufacturing District 
M-2 General Manufacturing District 
PUD Planned Unit Development District 
F-C Flood Plain and Conservation District 

 
 
SECTION 703. ZONING MAP. 
 
The boundaries of the districts are as shown upon the map which is made a part of this Ordinance.  Said 
map shall be known as the "Zoning Map".  The Zoning Map and all the notations, references, and other 
information shown thereon, are a part of this Ordinance and have the same force and effect as if the 
Zoning map and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon were all fully set forth 
or described herein.  Such map shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk and shall show thereon the 
date of adoption of said map. 
 
 
SECTION 704. ANNEXED TERRITORY. 
 
Any territory hereafter annexed to the City of Pell City shall continue to be subject to the county or city 
Zoning District classifications and regulations as such territory was subject at the time of annexation, until 
such territory shall have been zoned by the City of Pell City, or until the expiration of one (1) year after the 
date of such annexation, which ever shall first occur.  In the event that properties are annexed which were 
classified in a category not contained in this Ordinance or were classified in a category not comparable to 
a classification existing in this Ordinance, such properties will automatically be classified in the next 
higher restrictive zoning classification. 
 
 
SECTION 705. ABANDONED RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
 
Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the Mayor 
and the City Council of the City of Pell City, the Zoning District adjoining each side of such street, alley, or 
public way shall be automatically extended to the center of the same and all area included therein shall 
then be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended district. 
 
 
SECTION 706. FLOOD PLAIN CONSERVATION DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. 
 
The boundaries of any F-C, Flood Plain Conservation District, shown on the Zoning Map shall be 
interpreted as the boundary of the 100 Year Flood as defined by the currently applicable FLOOD 
INSURANCE RATE MAP for the City of Pell City published by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 52 Article VIII.  Use Provisions for Zoning Districts 

A R T I C L E  V I I I  
 

U S E  P R O V I S I O N S  F O R  Z O N I N G  D I S T R I C T S  
 
 
The purpose of this Article is to provide for the determination of uses compatible with the various Zoning 
Districts established in Article VIl.  Each of the use districts as defined and established in “Article VII: 
Boundaries and Establishment of Districts” shall be subject to specific regulations regarding uses 
permitted, uses permitted by conditional use, uses not permitted, required lot area and width, yard 
setbacks, and maximum building height. 
 
 
SECTION 801. USE LIMITATIONS. 
 
Although a use may be permitted according to specified procedures in a particular district, such use may 
not necessarily be permitted on every parcel of land in the district.  A use may be permitted only if it can 
meet all of the standards of this Ordinance and other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. 
 
 
SECTION 802. INTERPRETATIONS OF USES. 
 
This Ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings given the infinite variations of 
essentially similar uses.  Therefore, the Building Inspector is empowered to make interpretations so as to 
classify any questioned use within a listed use classification of most similar impact and characteristics.  
However, in no case shall the Building Inspector interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use 
in question is more similar in impact and characteristics to another listed use.  Appeals of the Building 
Inspector’s use interpretation may be made to the Board of Adjustment. 
 
 
SECTION 803. UNCLASSIFIED USES. 
 
In the event the Building Inspector receives application for permitting of a use that is not listed or that 
cannot appropriately fit a use listed in “Section 804.00: Uses Allowed”, the following procedure shall 
apply: 
 

1. If compatible with the existing use district intent, the unclassified use may be permitted as a 
conditional use by the Planning Commission pursuant to “Section 306:  Conditional Use 
Regulations”. 

 
2. If the unclassified use would not be compatible with the intent of the existing use district, the 

Building Inspector shall make a determination of the most appropriate use district, and require the 
applicant have the property rezoned, and conditional use granted by the Planning Commission 
pursuant to “Section 306:  Conditional Use Regulations” before granting approval. 

 
3. Following final action of the unclassified use per above paragraphs, the Planning Commission 

may initiate an amendment to this Ordinance to list the newly permitted use in the most 
appropriate district(s). 

 
 
SECTION 804.00.  USES ALLOWED.   
 
Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Ordinance, no building, structure or land shall be used or 
occupied except in the Zoning Districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in this section.  The 
general use categories specified by Table VIII-1 are defined in Articles X through XIII. 
 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 53 Article VIII.  Use Provisions for Zoning Districts 

Uses allowed in each district are determined from TABLE VIII-1.  Categories for each use are: 
 

A. Permitted [P]. Allowed as of right; applicant need only submit the necessary plans for review to 
the Building Inspector. 

 
B. Conditional Use [C]. Further review and special permission is required from the Planning 

Commission as per Section 306. 
 

C. Not Permitted [N]. Use not allowed in this district. 
 

D. Subject to Special Use Regulations [*]. See Article IX for Special Use Regulations.

                              {See Ordinance 2015-4497 for revisions to 903.05 through 903.06.06} 
 

903.05.01.  Purpose.  
 
The purpose of these guidelines is to establish minimum considerations and criteria for the review 
of communication towers.  It is the City of Pell City’s express intent that the construction of new 
towers be an option of last resort; to the greatest extent feasible, location of antennae on existing 
towers, and other suitable structures should first be sought.  These guidelines are designed to 
ensure the compatibility of towers with and avoid adverse impacts to nearby properties and 
discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the City of Pell City. 

 
903.05.02. Applicability.   
 
All communication towers and antennae shall met the minimum requirements as prescribed in 
this ordinance and any additional regulations adopted by the City Council governing the 
development and construction of communication towers and antennae. 

 
903.05.03. Objectives.   
 
The proposed locations and design of all communication towers shall duly consider the following 
public health, safety and general welfare objectives: 

 
1. Structural Safety.  The proposed tower will comply with wind loading and other structural 

standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as not to endanger the 
health and safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of 
the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. 
 

2. View Protection.  The proposed tower facility will be designed to minimize adverse visual 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 60 Article IX.  Special Use Regulations 

impacts to surrounding properties and the public right-of-way, given the topography of the 
proposed site and surrounding area. 
 

3. Land Use Compatibility.  The proposed tower facility will be compatible with the 
surrounding land uses, given the character of the use and development of the location. 
 

4. Design Harmony.  The proposed tower facility will be designed in harmony with the 
natural setting and the surrounding development pattern as well as to the highest industry 
standards. 
 

5. Existing Communication Services.  The proposed tower facility will comply with FCC and 
other applicable agency standards so as not to interfere with existing communication 
services in the area. 
 

6. Health Effects.  The proposed tower will comply with all applicable federal, state, county 
and Town health standards so as not to cause detrimental health effects to persons in the 
surrounding area. 

 
903.05.04. Development Criteria.   
 
The City of Pell City building inspector and town engineer shall review all communications towers 
requesting permits for compliance with the applicable standards and criteria listed below.  These 
criteria are considered the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and general 
welfare.  The Pell City Planning Commission may also impose higher standards if it deems them 
to be necessary to further the objectives of this section. 

 
1. Setbacks. 

 
A. Where permitted, the distance between the base of the tower, including guys, 

accessory facilities and property lines abutting urban residential districts, public parks 
and roads, must equal twenty percent (20%) of the tower height.  Property lines 
adjacent to other uses (e.g. agricultural, industrial) shall require a setback equal to 
the rear yard setback established for the underlying zone. 

B. When located within or adjacent to a residential district or dwelling, the minimum 
standard setback from all adjoining residential property boundaries shall be fifty feet 
(50’). 

C. The Site Review by the Planning Commission may reduce the standard setbacks in 
exceptional cases where a hardship would result due to unusual conditions on the 
site or other impracticalities.  However, the Planning Commission shall not reduce the 
setbacks to the detriment of affected residential properties. 

 
2. Appearance. 

 
A. Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish so as to reduce the 

visibility of the structure, unless other standards are required by the FAA. 
B. The design of the tower shall be of a type that has the least visual impact on the 

surrounding area. 
C. The design of the tower compound shall, to the greatest extent possible, maximize 

use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively 
blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. 

D. Where communication towers are deemed appropriate for a given location, the type 
of tower shall be restricted to monopoles in or within 1,000 feet of residential areas 
and area of special aesthetic concerns such as commercial revitalization areas, 
historic districts and scenic corridors. 

 
3. Lighting.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by FAA or other authority 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 61 Article IX.  Special Use Regulations 

for safety purposes.  Where required, the Planning Commission shall review the available 
lighting alternatives and approve that design that would cause the least disturbance to 
the surrounding views.  “Dual lighting” (red at night/strobe during the day) shall be 
preferred unless restricted by the FAA.  Security lighting may be permitted in accordance 
with “903.05.04.5: Security Devices” below. 

 
4. Landscaping. 

 
A. A landscaped buffer shall effectively screen the view of the tower compound from 

adjacent public ways and residential properties. 
B. The standard buffer shall consist of a minimum eight feet (8’) wide landscaped strip 

outside the dark vinyl coated steel security fencing of the perimeter of the compound.  
The buffer strip shall be planted with an attractive combination of trees, shrubs, vines 
and/or ground covers that can achieve the full height of the fence at maturity and 
enhances the outward appearance of the security fence.  For sites within 1,000 feet 
of a residence, the Site Review by the Planning Commission may impose increased 
buffer standards to include a decay-resistant, solid wood fence, earth berms and 
brick or masonry walls in addition to the security fencing.  All fencing and landscaping 
shall be maintained by the lessor/owner. 

C. In isolated non-residential areas, alternative landscaping methods may be accepted, 
such as the use of earth toned colored, vinyl-coated steel security fencing in 
combination with four feet of evergreen trees, shrubs, vines and/or other plantings. 

D. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as 
remote, agricultural or rural locations, or developed heavy industrial areas, the 
landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived by the Planning Commission. 

E. Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to 
the maximum extent possible.  In some cases, such as towers located on large, 
wooded lots, preservation of substantial natural growth around the property perimeter 
may be a sufficient buffer. 

F. Cellular facilities utilizing underground vaults in lieu of above ground switching gear 
buildings shall be exempted from any buffer requirements. 

 
5. Security Devices.  The facility shall be fully secured.  A minimum eight feet (8’) high, dark 

vinyl coated steel fence shall be installed around the entire perimeter of the compound 
(measured to the top of the fence or barbed wired, if applicable).  Security fencing shall 
require screening in accordance with landscaping requirements, as defined above.  Other 
security measures shall include locks and alarms.  Approved barbed or razor wire and 
lighting of the compound shall be permitted, if deemed necessary to fully secure the 
tower compound. 

 
6. Access.  Driveways and parking shall be provided to assure the operator’s access to the 

facility for maintenance or emergency services.  In some cases, parking/access may be 
from an adjoining alley, public street or off-street parking area. 

 
7. Co-Location.  No new tower shall be established if space is structurally, technically and 

economically available on an existing tower, which would serve the area that, the new 
tower would serve.  Documentation that reasonable efforts have been made by the 
applicant to achieve co-location shall be submitted in accordance with Section 903.04.05 
(5) below.  Towers shall be designed to maximize shared use to the greatest extent 
possible, given the structural and technical limitations of the type of tower proposed.  In 
any event, co-location shall be encouraged.  If feasible, each tower shall, at a minimum, 
be designed for double its intended use for all transmitting and receiving antennae other 
than microwave dish antennae. 

 
8. Removal of Obsolete Towers.  Any tower that is no longer in use for its original 

communications purpose shall be removed at the owners’ expense.  The owner shall 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 62 Article IX.  Special Use Regulations 

provide the Building Inspector with a copy of the notice of the FCC of intent to cease 
operations, which shall be given ninety (90) days from the date of ceasing operations to 
remove the obsolete tower and accessory structures.  In the case of multiple operators 
sharing use of single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease 
operations. 

 
903.05.05. Application.   
 
Any application submitted for approval shall submit the following items, in addition to any other 
required items, to show compliance with these review standards. 

 
1. Statement of Impact on Health, Safety and Welfare.  A brief written statement shall 

address conformance with the health, safety and welfare objectives of this guideline. 
 

2. Site Plan.  A scaled site plan shall show the location and dimensions of all improvements, 
including setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, and other information 
necessary to determine compliance with the development criteria of these guidelines. 

 
3. Rendering.  A rendering of the tower, accessory facilities and compound shall depict 

colors, materials and treatment.  If lighting or other FAA requirements for tower color is 
proposed, evidence of such requirement shall be submitted. 

 
4. Justification for a New Tower.  A proposal for a new tower shall be documented by the 

applicant that the planned equipment for a proposed tower cannot be accommodated on 
an existing tower within the proposed service area.  The applicant shall submit a written 
affidavit showing what attempts have been made to share an existing tower or that no 
such tower exists. 

 
5. Certification of Shared Use Design.  A qualified engineer, registered in the State of 

Alabama, shall certify that the proposed tower’s structural design can accommodate a 
minimum of two (2) shared users, in accordance with “ 903.05.04: Development Criteria”. 

 
6. As Built Survey.  A qualified professional engineer, registered in the State of Alabama, 

shall certify that the proposed communication tower was built in accordance with the 
submitted site plan including the installation of any required buffer yard. 

 
7. Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including the number and types of antennae 

that can be accommodated. 
 

8. Mitigation measures for ice and other hazardous falling debris, including setbacks and 
de-icing equipment. 

 
9. Where applicable, adequate parking shall be provided, along with buffers where such 

tower abuts any residential Zoning District. Such towers shall be prohibited in any 
residential Zoning District of the City of Pell City, Alabama. 

 
903.05.06. Exceptions.   
 
Towers camouflaged to resemble woody trees or indigenous vegetation in order to blend in with 
the native landscape will be subject to administrative review by the Building Inspector, as are 
other types of concealment techniques.  Concealment techniques are design methods used to 
blend a wireless telecommunications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into 
the existing surroundings so as to not have the appearance of a wireless telecommunications 
facility.  Such structures shall be considered wireless telecommunications facilities and not spires, 
belfries, cupolas, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for 
purposes of applying height limitations.  Due to their height, such structures must be designed 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 63 Article IX.  Special Use Regulations 

with sensitivity to elements such as building bulk, massing and architectural treatment of both the 
wireless telecommunications facility and surrounding development.  Concealed towers on 
developed property must be disguised to appear as either a part of the structure housing, a 
principal uses, or an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal use 
occupying the property.  Concealed towers developed on unimproved property must be disguised 
to blend in with existing vegetation.  Example:  A tower of such design and treated with 
architectural material so camouflaged to resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches 
on its upper part (also known as a “monopine”). 

 
903.06.  Family Care Homes. 
 

1. The use shall be conducted within a single family residence. 
 

2. The building shall maintain the exterior appearance of a single family residence, with no 
separate outside entrances to individual bedrooms.

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 93 Article X.  Use Provisions for Residential Districts 

SECTION 1008. P-R PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. 
 
The P-R Residential District is designed to encourage innovative and creative facilities, use of the most 
advantageous construction techniques in the development of land for residential use and to encourage 
higher densities of land use.  At the same time, the district regulations will insure ample provision for 
efficient use of open space, promote high standards in the lay-out, design and construction of residential 
development and enhance the development of the land in the district in relation to the natural 
topographical features, slopes, flooded land and stream valleys, and adjacent land uses existing in the 
area.  To these ends, development under this district will be permitted only in accordance with a detailed 
development plan and after approval of the plan by the Planning Commission in accordance with the 
procedures contained herein. 
 
1008.1 General Provisions. 
 
All planned developments shall conform to the following provisions: 
 

1. Standards for Planned Development 
 

a. Available land shall be efficiently utilized. 
b. Structures and open space shall be arranged in such a way as best to serve the needs of 

residents and commercial users of the planned development and to minimize any 
adverse effects on neighboring properties. 

c. Scenic assets and natural features, such as trees, streams, and topographic features, 
shall be protected and preserved to the extent possible. 

d. Harmonious, design incorporating a variety of building types and variations in building 
styles, shall be encouraged. 

e. The public health, safety and general welfare and the purpose and intent of this 
Ordinance and the comprehensive plan shall be maintained and preserved. 

 
2. Comprehensive Plan 

 
a. The development plan shall substantially conform to the applicable provision of the 

adopted comprehensive plan of the City with respect to type, character and intensity of 
use and public facilities.  Residential planned developments shall not exceed the density 
permitted under each section, except as expressly permitted under the density bonus 
provisions of the PR regulations or as delineated by the City Planning Commission. 

b. The uses proposed by the development plan shall be designed to prevent substantial 
injury to the use and value of existing surrounding development and shall not hinder, 
deter or impede development of surrounding undeveloped properties in accordance with 
the comprehensive plan. 

c. Fences, walls or vegetative screening shall be provided at the perimeter of planned 
developments where necessary to screen improvements, glare, uses or other influences 
having an adverse impact either on the planned development or on adjacent property.  
Such screening shall be of sufficient height to eliminate the impact of such adverse 
elements on the first floor of any use located either within or adjacent to the planned 
development. 

 
3. Vehicular and Pedestrian Movement 
 

a. Principal vehicular access to a planned development shall be from streets and roads 
capable of supporting existing traffic and the traffic that will be generated by the planned 
development.  Access points shall be designed to provide smooth traffic flow, controlled 
turning movements, and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic.  Merging and 
turnout lanes and traffic dividers shall be provided where existing or anticipated heavy 
flows of traffic indicates such need.  No streets or roads within a planned development 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 94 Article X.  Use Provisions for Residential Districts 

shall connect to exterior streets in such a way as to encourage use of minor streets for 
through streets. 

b. Pedestrian access shall be arranged so as to provide safe and convenient routes to and 
from a planned development.  Pedestrian access routes within a planned development 
need not be adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, vehicular access routes.  Pedestrian 
crossings at the perimeter of a development shall be marked and controlled, and where 
pedestrians are exposed to substantial vehicular traffic, fencing or other similar barriers 
shall be erected to prevent crossing at other than designated points. 

c. Bicycle and bridle paths where provided, shall be coordinated with the pedestrian system, 
and street crossings shall be combined. 

 
Traffic visibility, both automotive and pedestrian, shall be preserved as follows: no 
impediment to visibility between two and one-half and seven feet above center line 
grades shall exist at the intersection of any street or road within a planned development 
or at its perimeter within a triangle beginning at the intersection of right-of-way edges 
(projected if round corners exist), thence fifty feet (50’) along said edges, thence along 
the line connecting those two points.  Where pedestrian access of any kind exists within a 
planned development to a perimeter street or road, without a barrier to prevent 
indiscriminate entrance into such street or road, no substantial impediment to visibility 
shall be permitted between two and one-half feet (2

1
/2’) and seven feet (7’) above the 

center line of the street or road or above the ground level of the access areas. 
d. Within a planned development, streets, roads, driveways, parking, loading, and service 

areas shall be designed so as to provide safe and convenient vehicular access to all uses 
and facilities.  Pedestrian ways to be used by substantial numbers of children shall be 
located and controlled to minimize contact with vehicular traffic.  Pedestrian passages 
over and under vehicular roads shall be used whenever possible. 

e. Developed recreation space and other open space intended for pedestrian-oriented 
structures, such as schools and churches, shall be accessible from related structures, 
such as dwellings and office buildings, with a minimum of street crossings.  Where 
possible, such uses shall be interconnected by a common pedestrian system. 

 
4. Public Facilities 

 
a. The planned development shall be located in an area within which police and fire 

protection and public facilities are available and adequate for the uses proposed: 
provided, however, that the applicant may provide such facilities which are not presently 
available, and written assurance of such provision shall be included as a part of the 
development plan.

legal ownership and maintenance of any common open space designated on the 
development plan.  Such organization shall be created by covenants running with the 
land, and such covenants shall be included as part of development plans and subject to 
approval by the City Attorney and City Council.  Such organization shall not be dissolved 
nor shall it dispose of any common open space, by sale or otherwise (except to an 
organization conceived and organized to own and maintain the common open space), 
without first offering to dedicate the same to the City. 

 
6. Unit Development 

 
a. When a planned development is to be constructed in stages or units, and includes 

common open space, the total area of common or dedicated open spare provided at any 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 95 Article X.  Use Provisions for Residential Districts 

stage of development shall bear substantially the same relationship to the total open

4. Exceptions and waiver of minimum area requirement for "Density Development Area": This 

Ordinance is designed to permit the construction of apartments and other multiple family 
dwellings throughout the City on the basis of progressive density provisions allowing for 
increased density proportionate to the acres being considered for development.  It is intended 
to encourage large scale planned development and to minimize negative effects on existing 
residential areas and other land uses that may occur as a result of small scale density 
development in an area.  It is recognized, however, that large tracts of land may be 
uneconomical to assemble in developed areas of the City, and that small tracts close to the 
center of City may be suitable for higher density development.  For this reason, exceptions to 
the minimum area of development for density construction may be made subject to the 
following provisions and in accordance with the areas outlined in the Comprehensive Plan.

SECTION 1301. THE FC FLOODPLAIN CONSERVATION DISTRICT. 
 
The purpose of this district is to protect public health, safety, and general welfare: to protect persons, 
private and public property from the hazards of flood water inundation, and to protect the community from 
costs which are incurred when urban development occurs in flood plains. 100-year flood plain areas will 
be conserved for open land uses, agricultural uses, recreational areas and other uses which do not 
require extensive buildings within the flood plain. 
 
1301.01. Permitted Uses. 
 

1. Wildlife refuges, including game preserves, sanctuaries, and forest reserves. 
 
2. Watershed reservation areas and reservoirs.

regulations under the conditions herein listed; and after a public hearing before the City 
Council, the following may be permitted: 

 
2. Permanent building structures associated with the uses permitted provided that the first floor 

level shall be at or above an elevation of the flood of record plus two feet (2’), and that such 
construction shall not impede the flow of flood waters nor increase the hazard of flooding 
either upstream or downstream. 

 
 
SECTION 1302. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
 
A Planned Unit Development Overlay District may overlay, or include, properties located in one or more 
use districts.  The Planning Commission shall, in accord with this Ordinance, apply additional regulation, 
in the form of design and development review guidelines, to govern development of land within such 
districts, and those guidelines shall be applied in lieu of or in addition to, as the case may be, other 
regulations required in the underlying use districts.  The Planning Commission may, from time to time and 
subsequent to a public hearing, add to those guidelines in a manner not inappropriate to the purposes of 
this district. 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 118 Article XIII.  Use Provisions for Special Districts 

 
1302.01. Designation of Districts.   
 
A Planned Unit Development Overlay District may be established for any tract with a minimum site area of 
five (5) acres whose development could be undertaken as an integral unit under single ownership or 
control.  Before the City Council shall designate or amend the boundaries of any Planned Unit 
Development Overlay District(s), the Planning Commission shall first submit a report to the City Council, 
which shall include the conceptual site plan required by Section 1302.02 and shall, in addition, outline the 
boundaries of the proposed overlay district and indicate the Commission’s specific intent for development 
within the overlay district and how implementation of the Comprehensive Plan would be furthered by such 
development. 
 
1302.02. Application Requirements.   
 
A conceptual site plan shall accompany each application for rezoning to the PUD Overlay District.  The 
site plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a professional engineer, land surveyor, 
architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Alabama.  The site plan shall show, in 
schematic detail, the concept for use and development of the entire PUD overlay district, including the 
location of the proposed uses and major buildings, the proposed residential density, housing types, 
dimensional standards for all lots, layout of roads, location of all entrances, and layout and configuration 
of all common open spaces.  The site plan shall be accompanied by a brief narrative text describing the 
general design and architectural policies for the PUD, treatment of environmentally sensitive lands, and 
proposed time frame for phased development. 
 
1302.03. Permitted Uses and Development.   
 
Development of the PUD shall be in substantial accord with the approved conceptual site plan required in 
Section 1302.02, and with all other site plan and subdivision approval procedures as required by this 
Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations.  There shall be permitted a mix of uses within a single 
development and within lots as shown on the Final Subdivision Plat as required by the Subdivision 
Regulations.  Such mix shall reflect and appropriately account for the relative land areas and 
development densities called for in the underlying use districts, but may relocate, within the spirit of this 
Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan, such uses within the planned unit development.  The purpose of 
this limitation is to ensure that this overlay district is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to create 
higher density development than called for by the underlying use districts.

A M E N D E D   A U G U S T  3 ,  2 0 0 6  
O R D I N A N C E  N O .  2 0 0 6 - 1 8 8 3   

 
S I G N  A N D  O U T D O O R  A D V E R T I S I N G  R E G U L A T I O N S  

 
 
The purpose of this Article is to regulate all exterior signs and interior signs placed for exterior observance 
so as 1) to protect health, safety, morals, and to promote the public welfare, 2) to protect property values 
and the public investment in streets and highways, 3) to protect the character of the various communities 
of the City, 4) to prevent the uncontrolled erection of outdoor signs in that indiscriminate erection and 
maintenance of large signs seriously detracts from the enjoyment and pleasure of the natural scenic 
beauty of the city which in turn injuriously affects the tourist trade and thereby the economic well-being of 
the City, 5) to ensure that information in the specific interest of the traveling public is presented safely and 
effectively, 6) to provide for the above while recognizing that a reasonable freedom to advertise is 
necessary to attain such objectives. 
 
The principal features are the restriction of advertising to the business or use of the premises on which 
the sign is located and the restriction of the total sign area permissible per site.  Any sign placed on land 
or on a building for the purpose of identification or for advertising a use conducted therein or there on 
shall be deemed to be accessory and incidental to such land, building or use.  It is intended that the 
display of signs will be appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and be 
adequate, but not excessive for the intended purpose of identification or advertisement.  With respect to 
signs advertising business use, it is specifically intended among other things, to avoid excessive 
competition and clutter among sign displays in their demand for public attention.  It is further intended that 
in commercial areas now in existence and more so in proposed commercial and industrial areas that all 
signs within one complex be coordinated with the architecture in such a manner that an overall 
appearance is harmonious in color, form and proportion. 
 
It is also intended by this section that all temporary signs erected for directional purposes, for public 
information or to call attention to special events shall be confined to those that are of general public 
interest and that such signs shall be limited to the giving of information. 
 
All other signs commonly referred to as outdoor advertising, billboards or poster panels which advertise 
products or businesses not connected with the site or building on which they are located, are deemed by 
this section to constitute a separate use.  Any widespread display of outdoor advertising is deemed to be 
inappropriate to the character and sound development of the City and it is intended that such advertising 
be confined to unimproved commercial or industrial property subject to the restrictions set forth under 
Section 1508 below. 
 
 
SECTION 1501. DEFINITIONS. 
 
The following general definitions and sign classification definitions by function and by structure are 
provided to facilitate administration and enforcement of the provisions in this Article. 
 
1501.01. General Definitions  

 
1. Awning – (See Canopy).

provisions shall apply to all nonconforming signs within the City. 
 

1. Any permanent sign legally existing on or before the date of adoption of these regulations, or 
any future amendment thereto, that does not conform with the requirements of these 
regulations shall be considered a nonconforming sign.  No sign erected in violation of a 
previous sign ordinance shall, by virtue of adoption of this Ordinance, become a conforming

replacement cost at the time of damage, unless approved by the City Council. Determining 
the appraised value of the sign shall be the responsibility of the City Council. 

 
4.  Replacement – A nonconforming sign shall be replaced only by a conforming sign. 

 
 
SECTION 1510. REMOVAL, MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY. 
 
  
Section A:    That the provisions of Section 1510 of Ordinance 2004-1766, as previously amended, are

property on which such sign is located and may be collected in the manner of ordinary debt or in the 
manner of taxes and such charge shall be in lien on the property. 
 
1510.04 Abandoned Signs. 
 
A sign shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located when the 
business which it advertises is no longer conducted on the premises. If the owner or lessee fails to 
remove the sign, the City shall remove it in accordance with Section 1510.03. above.  These removal 
provisions shall not apply where a succeeding owner or lessee conducts the same type of business and 
agrees to maintain the signs as provided in this Ordinance or changes copy on the signs to advertise the 
type of business being conducted on the premises and provided the signs comply with the other 
provisions of this Ordinance.

section or provision of this Ordinance.

N O N C O N F O R M I N G  U S E S  O F  L A N D  AN D  B U I L D I N G S  
 
 
Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist 
lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the 
Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the 
terms of this Ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these 
nonconformities to continue until they are removed. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that 
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding 
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. It is further the intent of this Ordinance 
that the nonconforming use of land, of structures, or of land and structures in combination be 
discontinued as required by this Article. 
 
 
SECTION 1601. CONTINUANCE. 
 
A nonconforming use of land, nonconforming structure, or nonconforming use of land and structure in 
combination existing at the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, except as hereinafter 
provided, though such use does not conform with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
 
SECTION 1602. ENLARGEMENT, EXTENSION, AND ALTERATION. 
 

1. The nonconforming use of land shall not be enlarged or increased, extended to occupy a 
greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of this Ordinance, nor moved to 
any portion of the premise or parcel of land than was occupied on the effective date of this 
Ordinance. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance shall 
be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.  

 
2. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its 

nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its 
nonconformity. Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance 
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located 
after it is moved. 

 
3. An existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, extended, or 

structurally altered except in changing the use of this structure to a use permitted in the 
district in which it is located. The extension of the nonconforming use throughout such 
existing structure, as constructed on the effective date of this Ordinance, shall not be 
considered an expansion of a nonconformity; but no such use shall be extended to occupy 
any land outside such structure. 

 
 
SECTION 1603. RESTORATION TO SAFE CONDITION. 
 
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the restoration of any building or structure to a safe or sanitary 
condition when required by the proper authorities. 
 
 
SECTION 1604. RESTORATION AFTER DAMAGES. 
 
No nonconforming use, other than dwellings, which have been damaged by fire or other causes to the 
extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its current replacement value at the time of such damage, shall 



 

Pell City Zoning Ordinance 151 Article XVI Nonconforming Uses of Land and Buildings  

be rebuilt or restored except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. If a nonconforming 
building is damaged less than sixty percent (60%) of its current replacement value, it may be rebuilt or 
restored and used as before the damage, provided that such rebuilding or restoration is completed within 
twelve (12) months of the date of such damage. No nonconforming dwellings damaged by fire or other 
causes to the extent of more than seventy-five (75%) percent of its current replacement value at the time 
of such damage, shall be rebuilt or restored except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. If a 
nonconforming dwelling is damaged less than seventy-five percent (75%) of its current replacement 
value, it may be rebuilt or restored and used as before the damage, provided that such rebuilding or 
restoration is completed within twelve (12) months of the date of such damage. 
 
 
SECTION 1605. ABANDONMENT. 
 
A nonconforming use, other than dwellings located in Residential Districts, which has been discontinued 
for a continuous period of one year shall not be reestablished and any future use shall be in conformity 
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The use of any nonconforming dwelling in Residential Districts 
which has been discontinued for a continuous period of one year shall not be reestablished except by 
special approval by the Planning Commission. Abandonment of manufactured homes on nonconforming 
lots within the R-A District shall comply with the provisions of Section 1001.05. 
 
 
SECTION 1606. CHANGES IN USE. 
 
A nonconforming use of a structure, or of structures and land in combination, may as a special exception 
be changed to another nonconforming use; provided, that the Board of Adjustment shall find that the 
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing use. In permitting
