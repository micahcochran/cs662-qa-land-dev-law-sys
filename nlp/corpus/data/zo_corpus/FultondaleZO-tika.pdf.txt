and alley lines or land lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be
such boundaries.

2 In unsubdivided property or tracts where a district boundary
divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are
indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the
scale appearing on such maps.

Be Where boundaries are approximately parallel to public right-of-way

2.11

2.12

Section 3.0

3.1

Interpretation Of Uses

This ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings given the
infinite variations of essentially similar uses. Therefore, the Building Inspector
is empowered to make interpretations so as to classify any questioned use within
a listed use of most similar impact and characteristics. However, in no case shall
the building inspector interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in
question is more similar in impact and characteristics to another listed use. Any
appeals related to the Building Inspector’s use interpretation may be filed with the
Zoning Board of Adjustment.

Unclassified Uses

A. In the event the Building Inspector finds a new or unusual use that cannot
appropriately fit a listed use in any district, the following procedures shall
be followed:

I, If compatible with the existing zoning district intent, the unclassified
use shall be permitted by Special Exception upon approval and
subject to the conditions set by the Fultondale Zoning Board of
Adjustment.

2s If the unclassified use would not be compatible with the intent of
the existing zoning district intent, the Building Inspector shall
determine the most appropriate zoning district classification and
require the property in question to be rezoned. In addition, the
unclassified use shall be permitted in the new district by special
exception if granted approval by Fultondale Zoning Board of
Adjustment. See Article VII.

a, Following final action on the unclassified use, as (1) and (2) above
may require, the Fultondale Planning Commission may initiate an
amendment to this Ordinance to list the newly permitted use in the
most appropriate district(s).

Zoning Board of Adjustment

Appointment

A board of Zoning Adjustment is hereby established. Such board shall be
appointed as provided by Code of Alabama, 1975, Section 11-52-80, or as such,
may be amended; and, it shall have all powers granted therein.

To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this Ordinance
as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.

4.1 Justification

A. Variances to the terms of this Chapter may be granted individual cases
upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Adjustment that the variance will
not be contrary to the public interest and where owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would
result in unnecessary hardship. Another essential factor is that the spirit
of the Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. More
specifically, the board shall determine all of the following criteria have
been satisfied.

1. The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary
hardship, even to the extent of authorizing nonconforming uses.
Where the Board authorizes a nonconforming use in a district to
prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors, when taken
together, must indicate that the plight of the premises in question
is unique in that they cannot be put reasonably to a conforming use
because of the limitations imposed upon them by reason of their
classification in a specific zone.

8

 




Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional
circumstances.

Hardship alone is NOT sufficient. Alabama statutes require
unnecessary hardship.

Mere financial loss of a kind, which might be common to all of the
property owners in a district, is not an unnecessary hardship.

When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis
for claim that a variance should be granted.

Variances should be granted sparingly and the spirit of this Chapter,
in harmony with the spirit of State Law, should be carefully
preserved to the end, that the structure of this section would not
disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands of the
Zoning Board of Adjustment.

4.2 Application For A Variance

A.

An application for a variance shall be filed with the Office of the Building
Inspector at least twenty-one (21) days ahead of the scheduled hearing date
before the Board of Adjustment. The application shall be filed by the
property owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made
available from the Building Inspector and shall include the following:

the property owner, if any.

Zoning and land use of the property under consideration.

Justification for the variance in accordance with ALL of the
criteria in Section 4.0, Subsection 4.1.

A vicinity map showing the location of the property.

A plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property
boundaries and proposed development layout with the variance
noted or highlighted.

on the most recent records of the Jefferson County-Tax Assessor’s
Office.

give written notice of the variance request to all adjacent property owners.
Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States
Mail, first class, postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at
the addresses as submitted with the variance application. Any error in the
address of such notices shall not invalidate the giving of notice, provided
that no more than five percent (5%) of the total number of notices given
contain any such error. Such notice shall state the following:

1. The name of the applicant.
2s The location of the property.
B. The nature of the variance and applicable zoning provisions.

4, The time, date and location of the Zoning Board of Adjustment
hearing at which said application is to be considered.

Action On Appeals

In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Ordinance, reverse,
affirm (wholly or partly) or modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination as to what should be made; and, to that end, shall have powers of
the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote
of four members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Building Inspector, or to decide in
favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
Ordinance, or to affect any variation in the application of this Ordinance.

Appeals - How Taken

Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved
of by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any
decision of the administrative official. Such appeals shall be taken within a
reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) days or such lesser period as may be
provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the Building Inspector and with
the Zoning Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.

10

 




4.6

4.7

Section 5.0

The administrative official shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting which the action appealed from was taken.

The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing of the
appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest,
and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or attorney.

Stay Of Proceedings

An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the
Building Inspector certifies to the Zoning Board of Adjustment (after the notice
of appeal is filed by him or her) that by reason of facts stated in the certificate,
a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.
In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment or by a court of record
on application, on notice to the Building Inspector from whom the appeal is taken
and on due cause shown.

Appeals From The Action Of The Board

Any party aggrieved by any final judgement of the Zoning Board of Adjustment,
may appeal therefrom to the Circuit Court or court of like jurisdiction as provided
by Code of Alabama, 1975, Section 11-52-81, or as the same may be amended
within 15 days from the date of the Board hearing.

Special Exception Uses

In certain cases, land uses are identified for special zoning treatment. The nature of these
uses is such that, when properly regulated, they are appropriate in several zone districts. In
order to bring about the proper integration of uses into the City’s land use pattern, a special set
of criteria or standards may be provided for each use listed in the Special Exception Use
category. Review of these standards will tend to maintain compatibility with adjoining land uses
and it is intended that the Fultondale Zoning Board of Adjustment will review all such proposals
for these types of uses for compliance with the appropriate provisions before approval is granted
and appropriate permits are issued. See Article VII.

5.1

Special Exception Procedures

A. All uses listed as permitted by special exception shall require the
submission of an application to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. An
application for a special exception use shall be filed with the Building
Inspector at least twenty-one (21) days ahead of the scheduled hearing date
before the Zoning Board of Adjustment. An application shall be filed by
the property owner or the authorized agent of the property owner on a

11

 




form made available by the Building Inspector. Such form shall be
completed by the applicant or agent and include the following:

City Council Action on Amendments

Notification and Adoption Requirements

At least fifteen (15) days in advance of the public hearing before the City Council,
the Council shall publish the proposed zoning amendment in full for one (1)
insertion in a newspaper of general circulation published within the City, together
with a notice stating the time and place that the Ordinance is to be considered by

adjacent property owners as well as those property owners within five hundred
feet (500°) of the subject property. Following the second public hearing, the
City Council must publish a synopsis of the proposed amendment. This synopsis
Should refer to the date and name of the newspaper in which the proposed
amendment was first published. Both insertions must be published fifteen (15)
days in advance of the passage of the Ordinance. If there is no newspaper of
general circulation published within the City, the City Council must have the
synopsis posted in four (4) conspicuous places within the municipality. Until
these publication requirements have been met, no adoption of a zoning ordinance
or amendment thereto will be valid.

After such hearing, the governing body may adopt the Ordinance as reported by

Commission until a period of six (6) months has elapsed from the date of such action by the City
Council. Furthermore, a withdrawal of the application for rezoning, after the hearing held by
the Planning Commission but prior to the hearing held by the City Council, shall also require
a six (6) month time period before another application may be submitted. However, the
Planning Commission may adjust this time period if in the opinion of a majority of the
Commission, an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing.
Each time the zoning amendment application is made, the required filing fee must be paid.
Under no condition shall the fee be refunded for failure of such proposed amendment to be
enacted into law.

Section 13.0 Buffers

13.1

13.2

Definition

A buffer is herein defined as a strip of land that is retained, planted or constructed
for the purpose of providing a means of: Screening or separating incompatible
land uses, promoting visual harmony, reducing noise, diverting emissions,
restricting passage and enhancing the natural environment - thereby providing for
a compatible mix of otherwise conflicting uses. A buffer may consist of the
following:

A. A natural barrier such as existing or planted trees or shrubs, or a |
combination of trees, shrubs or vegetation. Any combination of evergreen
trees or other deciduous trees (hardwoods) or shrubs are acceptable as
long as the desired visual barrier will be uniformly dense at the minimum
height required.

B. A solid opaque fence, a brick or masonry wall or an earth berm.

General Requirements for Buffers/Screening

Specifications for buffers shall be determined by the Planning Commission where
otherwise specified during its review of site development plans. Ata minimum,
buffers shall meet the following criteria: (a) If a natural barrier is specified in
the buffer strip, such barrier shall be a planting strip so planted that within one
full growing season after installation, said planting strip shall provide a visually
impervious barrier uniformly dense at all heights from the ground, and a minimum
of four feet (4”) tall throughout the entire length of the planting strip. The entire
surface area of the buffer shall be planted with trees and/or shrubs. Within three
(3) full growing seasons after installation, said planting strip shall have reached
a minimum height of six feet (6’) or greater.

A. If man-made screening methods are specified, the following shall apply:

1. Screening materials shall be continuously maintained, present an
attractive exterior appearance and be of durable construction.

2s Unless otherwise noted, acceptable Screening materials include:
wood stockade fences, decorative masonry walls, brick walls and
earth berms. Screening walls or fences shall be a minimum of six
feet (6’) in height (or as modified by the Planning Commission),
but not exceeding three feet (3) in height within any required front
yard.

a Location of screening shall not obstruct the visibility of traffic
circulation.

92

 




B.

Buffers shall be of sufficient: width, height, opacity and density to
eliminate the adverse impact on adjacent properties.

13.3. Modification or Waiver

The screening and planting requirements of this Section shall be applied equally
to similarly classified and situated properties, but may be modified or waived

altogether in certain cases where a building site is subject to any of the following
circumstances as determined by the Planning Commission:

A.

Where natural vegetation (trees and/or shrubs) exist on a piece of property, |
when application is made for a building permit, a strip of natural
vegetation shall be left undisturbed until the Building Inspector has
inspected such area and evaluated it with regard to the width requirements
set forth in the Zoning Ordinance for that specific use and zone, as well
as suitability. The Building Inspector may require that the developer retain
a portion of the natural vegetation as a greenbelt/buffer, where such
already exists, rather than require a man-made planting strip or other
method of screening. However, such greenbelt/buffer must be sufficient
in both height and/or density to achieve the desired purpose as a natural
barrier.

Where impending development of adjacent property would make these
standards unreasonable or impractical.

Where, after inspection by the Building Inspector, it is found that two (2)
different and incompatible zone districts abut each other but are already
separated by a street or alley, or where the view from the adjoining district
is blocked by a change in grade or other natural or man-made feature.

Where a greenbelt or planting strip cannot, in the professional opinion of
an expert, be expected to thrive due to poor soil conditions, intense shade
or similar conditions.

Fencing, where installed, shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.

All plantings shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition
by the party or parties required to provide such plantings and, when
necessary, replaced with new growth. All fencing shall be permanently
maintained in good condition and, whenever necessary, repaired or
replaced by the party or parties required to provide such fence.

In special cases where the side and/or rear yards may be inadequate to
meet the requirements for the buffer strip, the Planning Commission shall
determine, based upon the site plan review or other pertinent information
requested, an alternative method of screening or separation.
