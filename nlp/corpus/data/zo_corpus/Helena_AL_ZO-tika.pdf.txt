discharge of sediments to the Cahaba River.  This plan 
shall be consistent with the practices set forth by the 
Alabama Department of Environmental Management. 

 
5.7.8.2 The applicant shall demonstrate that development will not 

increase the likelihood of chemical or bio-hazard runoff in 
adverse amounts into the Cahaba River, Buck Creek or 
their tributaries which could be damaging to their 
ecosystems, or the applicant shall propose modifications to 
the plan to retain run-off on the site to bring the project into 
conformance with ADEM standards, such modification may 
require the inclusion of water quality monitoring stations. 

 
5.7.8.3 The applicant shall demonstrate, using methodology for 

small urban watersheds for a twenty-five year, twenty-four 
hour storm, that the total volume of storm water discharged 
from the site in its post development condition shall not 
exceed the total run-off in its pre-development condition.  If 
this analysis demonstrates that this standard will not be 
met, the applicant shall propose modifications to the plan 
to retain run-off on the site to bring the project into 
conformance with this standard. 
 
5.7.8.3.1 If stormwater detention facilities are 

required, said facilities will be engineered to 
retain the first ½ inch of storm run-off for 
residential development and the first 1-1/2 
inch of storm run-off for commercial and 
industrial development or comply with the 
recommendations of qualified engineering 
experts. 



- 69 - 
Zoning Ordinance 
UPD: 10.2021  v21.2

erosive velocities as may be accomplished 
by constructed velocity breaks, elevation 
drops, or other generally accepted 
engineering practices. 

 
5.7.8.4 Notwithstanding any of the above, in areas of Helena 

where the flood hazard has been determined and that are 
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of 
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of 
commerce and governmental services, and/or 
extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and 
protection, all development shall be done in accordance 
with the City of Helena Flood Plain requirements to 
maximize flood damage protection.  The standards of flood 
plain development shall apply to any land delineated on 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) whether or not the 
base flood elevation has been determined.  Permits shall 
be subject to the requirements of the City of Helena Flood 
Damage Prevention Ordinance for Non-Costal 
Communities.  However, no construction will be approved 
within the floodway. 

 
5.7.8.5 In considering “SDPR” zoning, the Helena Planning and 

Zoning Commission, with input (topography maps, 
engineering studies, water management studies, etc.) from 
the developer, may modify the buffer requirement as 
outlined in this Ordinance, as long as the proposed 
modification will achieve the intent of this Ordinance.  In 
considering any modification, attention will be given to 
maintaining natural vegetation and eliminating or reducing 
run-off.  All buffers and/or modifications will be shown in 
the master plan. 

   
5.7.9 Conflict with other regulations: Where the standards and management 

requirements of this section are in conflict with other laws, regulations, 
and policies regarding streams, steep slopes, erodible soils, wetlands, 
flood plains, timber harvesting, land disturbance activities or other 
environmental protective measures, the more restrictive shall apply.

ARTICLE XXIV SPECIAL DISTRICT 
 

Section 1. Generally 
 

Special districts are hereby authorized for the purpose of providing optional methods of 
land development, which encourages imaginative solutions to environmental design problems.  
Areas so established shall be characterized by a unified building and site development program 
providing for coordinated open space and architectural treatment.  The special districts 
authorized by this Article are also intended to provide means for the establishment of use which 
are generally considered to be incompatible with most other land usage. 
 

The procedure to be followed in the creation of special districts shall conform to the 
regulations for any other zone change with the following exceptions: 

 
1.1 Any petition for the establishment of a Special District shall be submitted to the 

Helena Planning Commission for its review and recommendation. The 
recommendation, which shall be in writing, shall state the Commission’s 
consideration of the following: 

 
1.1.1 The value and character of the property or properties adjacent to the  
 tract of land under consideration will not be adversely affected. 
 
1.1.2 That the proposed development is consistent with the intent and 
 purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, morals and 
 the general welfare. 

 
1.1.3 That the final plan for the proposed development meets the requirements 

of all other regulating bodies. 
 

1.1.4 That an approved method of sewage disposal is available to the tract 
under consideration. 

 
1.2 The establishment of a Special District will be for the express purpose of 

improving the tract of land in accordance with the approved plan of development 
for the particular tract of land and for the use set forth in the development plan. 

 
1.3 The owner or owners of a tract of land may petition the Helena City Council for 

an amendment to the official zoning map creating a special district only after the 
development plan has been approved and favorable recommendation on the 
zone change has been rendered by the Helena Planning Commission. 

 
1.4 If, within three hundred sixty-five (365) days for the effective date of the 

amendment, the Building Inspector has not received an application for a building 
permit, the City Council may, by appropriate action, repeal the amendment 
establishing the Special District.  Once a building permit is issued, the 
improvements set forth in the plan of development must be completed within 
twelve (12) years from date of issuance. Otherwise, the City Council may repeal 
the amendment establishing the Special District.

Zoning Ordinance 
UPD: 10.2021  v21.2

Section 3. General Regulations and Requirements 
 
 3.1 Purpose and Intent 
   
  3.1.1 The purpose of the Section in accordance with the purpose of the Zoning  
   Resolution of the City of Helena to protect the public health, safety and  
   welfare, is to establish minimum location requirements, siting criteria and  
   development standards for wireless communications facilities, and to do  
   so in such a way as to be consistent with the Federal    



- 105 - 
Zoning Ordinance 
UPD: 10.2021  v21.2 

   Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended.  It is therefore a   
   concurrent purpose of the Section to prevent discrimination between and  
   among the various providers in the wireless communication industry. 
 
   As authorized by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, as  
   amended, City of Helena finds it necessary to enact and enforce these  
   minimum standards and requirements, which are designed to assure  
   safety; ensure compatibility and adjacent land uses; protect against the  
   devaluation of property; preserve the character of existing communities  
   and their design; protect revitalization areas, historic areas and other  
   areas of special significance or public investment; avoid adverse visual  
   impacts to the City landscape; and discourage the unnecessary   
   proliferation of wireless  facilities. 
 
   It is the intent of this Section to encourage and maximize the use of  
   existing and approved (future) towers so that the construction of new  
   communications towers be an option of last resort.  To the extent feasible, 
   co-location of antennas on existing towers, or their attachment to   
   buildings, water towers and other suitable structures, should first be  
   sought.  However, where new tower construction is justified as being  
   absolutely necessary, compatible design measures, camouflaging   
   techniques and screening should be instituted to minimize any and all  
   detrimental effects to the area in which it is to be located. 
 
 3.2 Lighting Restrictions 
 
  3.2.1 There shall be no lighting on any towers except when required by the  
   F.A.A.  In cases where the F.A.A. does require a tower to be lighted, only  
   red blinking lights shall be used at night; white strobe lights will not be  
   permitted for nighttime lighting. Written documentation of any F.A.A.  
   directives to light a tower differently than provided herein must be   
   submitted with the zoning application. 
 
   Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of a low-density nature,  
   and shall not be directed or reflected away from/off of the site.  Wattage  
   of such lighting shall be restricted to the equivalent of a 150-watt bulb. 
 
 3.3 Co-Location Requirements 
 
  3.3.1 All towers constructed subsequent to the adoption of this Section, and  
   their associated compounds, shall be designed and built to accommodate 
   additional wireless communication service providers based on the height  
   of the tower as follows: 
    
   3.3.1.1  Towers 80 to 159 feet in height shall accommodate a  
     minimum of two (2) different providers, except as follows; 
   3.3.1.2  Towers 160 to 209 feet in height shall accommodate a  
     minimum of three (3) different providers, except as follows: 
   3.3.1.3  Towers 210 to 300 feet in height shall accommodate a  
     minimum of four (4) different providers.

Zoning Ordinance 
UPD: 10.2021  v21.2 

 
 3.4 Maximum Utilization of Existing Sites 
 
  3.4.1 No new communications tower shall be constructed if space is   
   structurally, technically and economically available for the proposed  
   communications antenna(s) and related facilities on an existing tower, or  
   on an alternative site (e.g., building or other structure), where such  
   alternative location would cover the required service area without creating 
   undue signal interference. 
 
 3.5 Permission to Co-Locate Required 
 
  3.5.1 Pursuant to Items 3.3. and 3.4. above, and to the stated purpose and  
   intent of this Section, the owner of any existing communications tower  
   that has space structurally and technically available for any additional  
   communications antennas shall make such space reasonably and   
   economically available to other providers. 
 
 3.6 Visual Impact 
 
  3.6.1 All new communication towers shall be designed to minimize adverse  
   visual impacts on/from surrounding residential properties, the public right- 
   of-way, or historically significant or aesthetically-sensitive areas through  
   landscaping, camouflaging and/or other similar techniques, given the  
   topography of the tower site and the surrounding area. 
 
 3.7 Use Compatibility and Design Harmony 
  
  3.7.1 All new communications tower facilities must be compatible with the  
   surrounding land uses, given the character of use(s) and development  
   trends in the area around the tower site.  Said tower facilities shall be  
   designed, both structurally and with regard to finish or color, to be as  
   much in harmony as possible with the natural setting of the site and/or the 
   surrounding development pattern, as well as being up to the highest  
   industry standards. 
 
 3.8 Safety  
 
  3.8.1 All communication towers must comply with wind loading and all other  
   applicable structural safety standards, building and technical codes  
   having jurisdiction, so as not to endanger the health and safety of   
   residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the  
   tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. 
 
 3.9 Security 
 
  3.9.1 A dark vinyl-coated, chain link steel fence shall be installed around the  
   perimeter of the compound, with a minimum height of eight feet (8') as  
   measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire, if applicable).

 3.10 Maintenance 
  
  3.10.1 The owner of a communications tower shall be responsible for   
   maintaining the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening,  
   buffers, security and other installations required by this Section, and by  
   any other applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, statutes or   
   conditions of approval imposed by the City of Helena or its authorized  
   representative, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site. 
 
 3.11 Abandoned Facilities 
 
  3.11.1 Any wireless communications facility that ceases to be used for its  
   original communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s   
   expense.  The owner of the facility shall provide the Building Official with  
   a copy of the notice to the F.C.C. of the intent to cease operations, and  
   shall have ninety (90) days from the date of such ceasing to remove the  
   obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its  
   natural condition. 
 
   In case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still  
   be required from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and  
   such provider will be required to remove its facilities with the ninety (90)  
   day period prescribed above.  At such time as all providers sharing use of 
   a tower cease operation of their facilities located thereon, the owner of  
   the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process as set forth  
   herein. 
 
 3.12 Violations 
 
  3.12.1 Any violation or other failure to comply with any provision of this Section  
   shall subject the violator to the fullest extend of the Remedies and   
   Penalties for Violation. 
 

Section 4. Area and Dimensional Requirements 
 
 For all of the above permitted uses, the area and dimensional regulations set for herein 
shall be observed: 
 
 4.1 Minimum Lot Area: None 
 
 4.2 Minimum Yard Setback: 15 feet* on all sides, including front and rear, as   
  measured from the U-2 zoning district boundary to the required security fence. 
 
  * Yard setbacks may be reduced to zero feet (0') if the adjoining property is  
  zoned Commercial, Industrial or Utilities. 
 
 4.3 All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed  
  tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence.  (Guy   
  anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound.)

Zoning Ordinance 
UPD: 10.2021  v21.2 

 4.4 The yard setback areas required herein shall be preserved and maintained in  
  accordance with a “buffer plan” approved as part of the required site plan.  The  
  City of Helena reserves the right to require a planted and/or landscaped buffer  
  where appropriate in cases where existing natural vegetation is not available, or  
  is otherwise inadequate for use as a buffer as determined by the Building Official. 
 

Section 5. Height and Location Restrictions 
 
 In regard to the height and siting for all of the above permitted uses, the regulations set 
forth herein shall be observed: 
 
 5.1 In relation to a residence: 
  
  5.1.1 No U-2 Communication Tower zoning district boundary shall be located  
   closer than five hundred feet (500') to any residence. Provided, however,  
   that this requirement may be waived or otherwise modified with regard to  
   a residence owned by the leaser of a tower site.  However, such waiver or 
   modification shall be contingent upon said owner/leaser submitting an  
   affidavit indemnifying the City of Helena from any litigation, by the current  
   and any subsequent owners, relating to the tower and zoning in question. 
 
 5.2 In relation to a Protected Residential Area: 
 
  5.2.1 No U-2 Communications Tower zoning district boundary shall be located  
   closer than one thousand feet (1,000') to the nearest boundary (zoning or  
   otherwise) of any protected residential area (as defined in this Section). 
 
  5.2.2 The maximum height of any tower whose zoning district boundary  lies, at  
   any point, one thousand feet (1,000') from a protected residential area  
   shall be one hundred eighty feet (180'). 
 
  5.2.3 For any tower whose zoning district boundary lies greater than one  
   thousand feet (1,000') away from any protected residential  area at its  
   nearest point, the maximum allowable height of such tower may be  
   increased one foot (1') for each additional eight feet (8') of distance from  
   such protected residential area. 
 
 5.3 In relation to height generally, no tower shall exceed a maximum height of three  
  hundred feet (300'). 
 

Section 6. Application and Justification 
 
 Sufficient justification must be submitted for the siteing of all new construction towers in 
the City of Helena.  Determination as to the adequacy of the justification for any new tower will 
be made as a routine part of the zoning process, and shall be based upon, along with the other 
standard land use considerations of appropriateness, the  review and evaluation of the 
application for a U-2 Communications Tower zoning designation.  The following information and 
materials shall accordingly be considered the minimum application requirements when applying 
for U-2 Communications Tower zoning:

UPD: 10.2021  v21.2 

   that are subordinate and incidental to approved non-residential uses or  
   structures (e.g., buildings, water towers, etc.) on the same parcel.   
   Exemption of such facilities from the requirements of this Section, and the 
   subsequent permitting of same, shall be made only after administrative  
   review and approval by the Building Official. 
 
  7.4.7 Camouflaged Towers and Antennas.  Upon adoption of this Section, the  
   Use Regulations of all other zoning districts shall also be hereby   
   amended to allow camouflaged towers and communications antennas as  
   a conditional use in any zoning district.  The conditions of such allowance  
   shall be that it can be clearly demonstrated that such location is in full  
   accord with the Purpose and Intent of this Section; that the proposed  
   facility satisfies the requirements of Section 3, subsection f., Visual  
   Impact, and Section 3, subsection g., Use Compatibility and Design  
   Harmony, to the fullest extent possible; and, that such facility meets the  
   criteria set forth herein below. 
 
   The general criteria for the permitting of new antennas under this Sub- 
   Item shall include the siting of an antenna on structures, whether new or  
   existing, such that it can be made as unobtrusive as possible by blending  
   it into the surrounding environment. 
 
   Any new structures on which such antennas are to locate shall hereafter  
   be deemed to the “camouflaged towers” as defined previously in the  
   Section.  Such towers may also be permitted as conditional uses in any  
   zoning district, provided they meet the general criteria of being   
   constructed such that they appear as structures that are normal,   
   customary or otherwise unobtrusive within the context of the surrounding  
   environment.  Such towers may be multi-functional, such as functioning  
   as a working street light while simultaneously supporting a    
   communications antenna, or may otherwise be made unobtrusive through 
   the use of color, camouflaging, architectural treatment, incorporation into  
   other buildings or structures, etc.. Whatever technique is utilized, all  
   towers permitted under this Sub-Item must achieve a satisfactory   
   appearance within the context of the surrounding environment. 
 
   Existing structures proposed to be used for the site of communications  
   antennas must also meet the criteria set forth for new structures, and for  
   the purposes of this Section, shall also be considered “camouflaged  
   towers” when used to support a communications antenna. 
 
   In order for a permit to be issued under this Sub-Item, any and all new  
   towers and antennas shall be subject to administrative review and   
   approval by the Building Official.  The Building Official shall determine the 
   sufficiency of the camouflaging of each such tower and antenna, and  
   shall base his/her decision whether or not to issue such permit thereon.
