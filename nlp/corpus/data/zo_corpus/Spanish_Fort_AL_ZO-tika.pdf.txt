placed on or across an existing utility or drainage easement. 3 

5.485 The setback requirements for side yards and/or front yards on corner lots 
shall not apply to any lot where the average setback on residentially 
developed lots located, wholly or in part, I 00 feet on each side of such lot 
and within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same 
streets as such lot, is less than the minimum required setback. In such 
cases, the setback on such lot may be less than the required setback, but 
not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the existing developed 
lots. 

5.486 Where the Coastal Construction Control Line applies and the yard 
requirements cannot be met, the Building Official may reduce the yard 
setback up to one-half the required distance, and even more reduction may 



be obtained by variance, except as otherwise required by ADEM or the 
Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. In no case shall the setback from the 
water edge of any water front lot to any primary structure be reduced to less 
than thirty-feet. (see Article IX).3 

5.5 SCREENING, LIGHTING AND SPACE. 

5 .51 In any Commercial District, any operation not conducted within a building, such as 
drive-in businesses, outdoor recreation, outdoor storage of materials, and outdoor 
servicing activities, shall be enclosed by a wall or fence of solid appearance or tight 
evergreen hedge not less than six (6) feet in height where necessary to conceal such 
areas or facilities from a residential district adjoining or facing across a street in the 
rear or on the side of the principal building or use. 

5.52 In any district where reference is made requiring adequate screening ofa specified 
operation, such screening shall be a wall or fence of solid appearance or tight 
evergreen hedge not less than six ( 6) feet in height. 

5.53 Outdoor lighting of all types shall be directed so as to reflect away from all adjacent 
properties and shall be so situated as not to reflect directly into any public 
right-of-way. 

5.54 All screening, lighting, space, etc., shall be in good condition and appearance. The 
Building Official may cause to be removed, replaced, repaired or corrected, at the 
owner's expense, any screening, lighting and space improperly maintained.3 

5 .6 SURFACE DRAINAGE. Owners, particularly developers of larger paved areas such as 
those in connection with apartment complexes, shopping centers, etc., shall be responsible 
for increased runoff resulting from these developments which cause flood damage to 
neighboring property. The Building Official shall, in consultation with the City Engineer, 
determine that reasonable provisions for properly handling surface drainage have been made 
in the applicant's design and report these findings for the Planning Commission's 
consideration in acting on building applications. If such reasonable provisions are not made 
in the applicant's design, the Planning Commission shall make such remedies as may be 
available to the applicant as a condition of the building permit issuance. 3 

5.7 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL. Where more than one acre of land will be 
disturbed for construction purposes, developers shall be required to submit a sediment and 
erosion control plan for approval (see Article VIII).

'1__006 

5.82 Water and Sewer Connections. Developments or individual lots in all districts must 
connect to public or private community water and sewer systems where such 
systems border any development or lot line or are reasonably available and the 
appropriate utility has the capacity to provide the service; otherwise, lots must meet 
the minimum size requirements of the Health Department for on-site wells and/or 
septic systems. Existing private wells and septic systems that are functioning 
properly and meet the Health Department requirements may continue to be used. 

5.821 It is the intent of this Ordinance to eliminate by attrition all existing private 
wells and septic systems in areas where public or private community water 
and sewer systems are available. Therefore, at such time as any private 
well or septic system is destroyed or must be replaced, the owner must 
connect to the public or private community water and sewer system where 
such systems border any development or lot line or are reasonably 
available and the appropriate utility has the capacity to provide the service. 

5.83 Other. All new utilities shall be placed underground. 

5.9 EXISTING COVENANTS. Where subdivisions, lots, or parcels exist which have already 
been recorded or which will be recorded with deed restrictions or other such restrictive 
covenants, such restrictions and covenants shall apply if they are more stringent than the 
requirements of this Ordinance; otherwise, the requirements of this Ordinance shall apply. 

5.010 GRANDFATHER CLAUSE. Any use of buildings or land existing on the dateofadoption 
of this Ordinance and not in compliance with its provisions shall be allowed to continue as a 
non-conforming use. Any land development projects in the City under legal authority of 
this Ordinance that are not located in a zoning district designated for their intended use may 
be permitted to continue provided that: 

5.010 l The project was under construction prior to the date of adoption of this Ordinance. 
For the purposes of this Section, under construction shall mean that a legal 
building or construction permit has been issued and that actual construction has 
been or will be started within the initial period of validity of the permit, exclusive 
of any time extensions, or that a permit application has been submitted to the 
Alabama Department of Environmental Management. 

5.0102 The project complies in other aspects with the requirements of this Ordinance for 
districts in which similar uses are permitted. 

5.0103 The developer complies with other conditions that may be required by the 
Planning Commission due to the unique circumstances of the land.

ARTICLE VIII 

EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

8.1 PLAN REQUIREMENT. An erosion and sediment control plan shall be a part of the 
construction plans for all developments in Spanish Fort's corporate limits and planning 
jurisdiction. Such plan shall accompany any application for subdivision or zoning approval, 
building permit, excavation or other construction activity whenever the proposed activity is 
to be undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, or more than one contiguous acre 
is to be uncovered.4 

8.2 PLAN SUBMISSION AND REVIEW. Whenever there is an area to be disturbed comprising 
more than one acre, three (3) copies of the erosion and sediment control plan shall be filed 
with the Building Inspector at the time the application for Land Use Certificate and Building 
Permit are submitted. A copy of the plans shall also be on file at the job site. If the Building 
Inspector and/or the City Engineer determine, either upon review of such plan or on 

- inspection of the job site, that a significant risk of off-site sedimentation or erosion exists, a 
revised plan shall be prepared and submitted. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, the 
work shall be either suspended or continued under conditions outlined by the Building 
Inspector and the City Engineer.4 

8.3 PLAN CONTENT. Erosion and sediment control plans shall contain architectural 
and engineering drawings, maps, assumptions, calculations and narrative statements 
as needed to accurately describe the proposed development of the site and the 
measures planned to meet the Basic Control Objectives. Plan content may vaFy to 
meet the needs of the specific site conditions, but the plan must show, at a mininmm, 
the best management practices (BMP's) which will be used to control site erosion 
during and after construction. Examples of best management practices shall include, 
but shall not be limited to, the following: 

Mulching 
Sodding 
Diversion berms 
Sedimentation catch basins 
Clean up practices 
Recreational area storage 
Diversion structure 
Ponds 
Retain natural vegetation 
Aeration of soils 4 

Detention basins 
Porous pavements 
Holding tanks 
Infiltration systems 
Channel storage 
Minimize disturbed land area 
Minimize the duration of 

exposure to the natural 
elements 

8.4 PROTECTION OF PROPERTY. Persons engaged in land-disturbing activities shall take all 



reasonable measures to protect all public and private property, including roadways, from 
damage by such activities. 

8.5 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES. The basic control objectives which should be considered 
in developing and implementing an erosion and sediment control plan are to: 

8.51 Identify Critical Areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and offÂ­
site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or 
sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention. 

8.52 Limit Exposed Areas. All land-disturbing activities should be planned and 
conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time. 

8.53 Limit Time of Exposure. All land-disturbing activities should be planned and 
conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time. 

8.54 Control Surface Water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas 
should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment Joss during exposure.4 

8.55 Control Sedimentation. All land-disturbing activities should be planned;, and 
conducted to minimize off-site sediment damage.4 

8.56 Manage Stormwater Runoff. When any land disturbing activity increases the peak 
rates and velocity of stormwater runoff into receiving ditches or stream channels, 
plans indicating the management of stormwater runoff shall be submitted and 
approved by the City Engineer. These plans shall include measures that control both 
the velocity and rate of increased runoff to minimize erosion and sediment 
deposition in the ditch or stream channel. 4 

8.6 STANDARDS. 

8.61 Mandatory Standards. No land-disturbing activity subject to these provisions and 
guidelines shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following 
requirements: 

8.611 

8.612 

No land-disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake, 
natural watercourse or adjacent property, unless a buffer zone is provided 
along the boundary of sufficient width to confine visible siltration and/or 
prevent erosion, provided that the land-disturbing activity is not in 
connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over or 
under a lake, natural watercourse or adjacent property.4 

The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle 
which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion 
control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, 
within 30 working days of completion of final grading, be planted or 



otherwise provided with ground cover, devices or structures sufficient to 
restrain erosion. 

8.613 Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising 
more than one acre, if more than one contiguous acre is uncovered, a 
ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be planted or otherwise 
provided within 30 working days on that portion of the tract upon which 
further active construction is not being undertaken, provided that this 
activity shall not apply to cleared land forming the basin of a reservoir 
later to be inundated. 

8.62 Design and Performance Standards. Erosion and sediment control measures, 
structures and devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide 
control from the calculated peak rates of runoff from a ten-year frequency storm. 
Runoff rates may be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil 
Conservation Services "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation 
Practices," or other acceptable calculation procedures. Runoff computations shall be 
based on rainfall data published by the National Weather Service for the area. All

WHEREAS, the Planning Commission of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, held a 
meeting on May 12, 2008, and the City Council of the City of Spanish Fort held a meeting on 
July 7, 2008, for the purpose of receiving public comments on proposed amendments to the 
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama; and 

WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, has determined that 
said Zoning Ordinance should be amended. 

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE 
CITY OF SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, AS FOLLOWS: 

SECTION 1. Section 7.9 of Ordinance No. 51-96 of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, 
the Zoning Ordinance, is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows: 

7.9 RADIO CELLULAR RADIO CELLULAR TELEPHONE AND WIRELESS 
COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS, ANTENNAS, DISHES AND RELATED 
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT. The purpose of this Section is to 
establish minimum location requirements, siting criteria and development standards for 
wireless communications facilities consistent with the Federal Telecommunications Act 
of 1996, as amended. No radio, telephone or wireless communications or transmitting 
towers and antennas, or their associated structures or equipment, shall be erected or 
constructed without first complying with the provisions of this ordinance and all 
applicable State and Federal rules and regulations. The underlying principles of these 
standards are to: (1) achieve a balance among the number, height and density of wireless 
communications facilities that is appropriate for our community; (2) encourage and 
maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings and other structures to 
accommodate new wireless communications facilities; (3) ensure the compatibility of 
towers with, and avoid the adverse impacts to, nearby property; and (4) discourage the 
proliferation of towers throughout the City of Spanish Fort. 

7.91 Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to the terms used in this 
Section: 

Accessory Structure Compound. A fenced, secured enclosure in which a wireless 
communications facility and its equipment, buildings, access roads, parking areas and 
other accessory devices/auxiliary structures are located. 

Alternative Support Structure. Any structure other than a wireless communications 
tower, which may include, but is not limited to, buildings, water towers, light poles, 
power poles, telephone poles and other essential public utility structures. 



2 

Antenna Support Structures. Any structure on which wireless communications antennas 
and cabling can be attached. (See also Communications Tower and Alternative Support 
Structure.) 

Co-location. The placement of more than one wireless communications antenna by one 
or more service providers on a single existing or approved antenna supporLstructure or ________ _ 
communications tower. 

Communications Antenna or Antenna. A device used to transmit and/or receive wireless 
communication services as authorized by the Federal Communications Commission, 
including all mounts and supporting structures. Communications antennas typically 
include: 

a. Microwave dish -- parabolic antennas that emit microwave signals. 

b. Panel antenna -- vertical and horizontal plane antennas that aim radio 
signals in specific directions. (Also referred to as sector antennas.) 

c. Whip antenna -- cylindrical antennas which emit radio signals in a 360-
degree horizontal plane and a compressed vertical plane. (Also referred to 
as stick, omni-directional or pipe antennas.) 

Communications Tower or Tower: Any ground-mounted structure that is designed and 
constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more communications 
antennas. Communications towers shall include: 

a. Monopole towers -- cylindrical self-supporting towers constructed as a 
single spire. 

b. Self-Supporting or Lattice towers -- self-supporting towers with multiple 
sides of open-framed supports. 

c. Guyed towers -- towers anchored with guy wires. 

d. Camouflaged towers -- self-supporting towers concealed such that they 
blend in with their surroundings. Such towers may be constructed to 
resemble objects, such as a tree or a street light, or may be concealed 
within another structure, such as a clock tower, church steeple, flag pole or 
lamp post. 



Concealment or Camouflage Techniques. Design techniques used to blend a wireless 
communications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the existing 
surroundings so that the appearance is not of a wireless communications facility. Such 
structures shall be considered wireless communications facilities and not spires, belfries, 
cupolas or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for 
purposes of applying height limitations. Due to their height, such structures must be

treatment of both the wireless communications facility and surrounding development. 
Concealed towers or communications antennas on developed property must be disguised 
to appear as either a part of the structure housing a principal use or an accessory structure 
that is normally associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed 
towers or communications antennas developed on unimproved property may be required 
to be disguised to blend in with existing vegetation. Example: A tower of such design 
and treated with architectural material so that the tower is camouflaged or disguised to 
resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches (also known as a "monopine"). 

F.A.A. the Federal Aviation Administration. 

F.C.C. the Federal Communications Commission. 

Height. When referring to a tower or alternative support structure, the distance measured

development, buildings, natural vegetationaiid landscaping. Such 
screening, as required, is subject to site plan review, shall have a minimum 
height of eight feet (8'), and may consist of one of the following: brick, 
masonry walls, solid wood fencing, berms or opaque barriers. All nonÂ­
vegetative screening shall be properly maintained by the property owner 
or lessor. 

(2) In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be 
minimal, such as remote, agricultural or rural locations, or developed 
heavy industrial areas, the non-vegetative screening requirement may be 
reduced. 

(3) The screening requirements may be reduced on wireless 
communications facilities utilizing underground vaults rather than above 
ground equipment buildings. 

d. Landscaping. In addition to the landscaping and buffer requirements set 
forth in Article VI and X, the following provisions shall also apply:

landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view 
of the compound from adjacent property and public ways. The standard 
buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip of at least ten feet (10') wide 
outside the perimeter of the compound. In locations where the visual 
impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirements may 
be reduced. 

(3) Where the property on which the wireless communication facility is 
located abuts, or is in close proximity to, a residential district or residential 
use, additional buffering may be required by the Zoning Administrator. 



7 

( 4) A row of trees a minimum of eight feet (8') tall and a maximum of ten 
feet (10') apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the compound 
fence. A continuous hedge of at least thirty (30") inches high at planting 
and capable of growing to at least thirty-six (36") inches in height within 
eighteen (18) months shall be placed in front of the tree line. 

( 5) All landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety. All landscaping

ORDINANCE NO. 326-2007 

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 51-96 
OF THE CITY OF SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA 

WHEREAS, the Planning Connnission of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, 
held a meeting on October 8, 2007, and the City Council of the City of Spanish Fort held a 
meeting on November 19, 2007, for the purpose of receiving public connnents on proposed 
amendments to the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama; and 

WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, has 
determined that said Zoning Ordinance should be amended. 

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF 
THE CITY OF SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, AS FOLLOWS: 

SECTION 1. Ordinance No. 51-96 of the City of Spanish Fort, Alabama, the 
Zoning Ordinance, is hereby amended by adding Section 7.9 as set forth below: 

7.9 RADIO. CELLULAR RADIO CELLULAR TELEPHONE AND WIRELESS 
COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS, ANTENNAS, DISHES AND RELATED 
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT. The purpose of this Section is to 
establish minimum location requirements, siting criteria and development standards for 
wireless connntmications facilities consistent with the Federal Teleconnnunications Act 
of 1996, as amended. No radio, telephone or wireless connnunications or transmitting 
towers and antennas, or their associated structures or equipment, shall be erected or 
constructed without first complying with the provisions of this ordinance and all 
applicable State and Federal rules and regulations. The underlying principles of these 
standards are to: (1) achieve a balance among the munber, height and density of wireless 
connnunications facilities that is appropriate for our cornn1unity; (2) encourage and 
maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings and other structures to 
acconnnodate new wireless connnunications facilities; (3) ensure the compatibility of 
towers with, and avoid the adverse impacts to, nearby property; and ( 4) discourage the 
proliferation of towers throughout the City of Spanish Fort. 

7.91 Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to the terms used in this 
Section: 

Accessory Structure Compound. A fenced, secured enclosure in which a wireless 
communications facility and its equipment, buildings, access roads, parking areas and 
other accessory devices/auxiliary structures are located. 

Alternative Support Structure. At,y structure other than a wireless connnunications 
tower, which may include, but is not limited to, buildings, water towers, light poles, 
power poles, telephone poles and other essential public utility structures. 

Antenna Support Structures. Any structure on which wireless connnunications antennas 
and cabling can be attached. (See also Communications Tower and Alternative Support 
Structure.) 

Co-location. The placement of more than one wireless connnunications antenna by one 
or more service providers on a singie existing or approved antenna support structure or 
connnunications tower. 

Connnunications Antem1a or Antenna. A device used to transmit and/ or receive wireless 
connnunication services as authorized by the Federal Connnunications Commission, 
including all mounts and supporting structures. Connnunications antennas typically 
include: 



2 

a. Microwave dish -- parabolic antennas that emit microwave signals. 

b. Panel antenna -- vertical and horizontal plane antennas that aim radio 
signals in specific directions. (Also referred to as sector antennas.) 

c. Whip antenna -- cylindrical antennas which emit radio signals in a 360-
degree horizontal plane and a compressed vertical plane. (Also referred to 
as stick, omni-directional or pipe antennas.) 

Communications Tower or Tower: Any ground-mounted structure that is designed and 
constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more communications 
antennas. Communications towers shall include: 

a. Monopole towers -- cylindrical self-supporting towers constructed as a 
single spire. 

b. Self-Supporting or Lattice towers -- self-supporting towers with multiple 
sides of open-framed supports. 

c. Guyed towers -- towers anchored with guy wires. 

d. Camouflaged towers -- self-supporting towers concealed such that they 
blend in with their surroundings. Such towers may be constructed to 
resemble objects, such as a tree or a street light, or may be concealed 
within another structure, such as a clock tower, church steeple, flag pole or 
lamp post. 

Concealment or Camouflage Techniques. Design techniques used to blend a wireless 
communications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the existing 
surroundings so that the appearance is not of a wireless communications facility. Such 
structures shall be considered wireless communications facilities and not spires, belfries, 
cupolas or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for 
purposes of applying height limitations. Due to their height, such structures must be 
designed with sensitivity to elements such as building bulk massing and architectural 
treatment of both the wireless communications facility and surrounding development. 
Concealed towers or communications antem1as on developed property must be disguised 
to appear as either a part of the structure housing a principal use or an accessory structure 
that is normally associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed 
towers or communications antennas developed on unimproved property may be required 
to be disguised to blend in with existing vegetation. Example: A tower of such design 
and treated with architectural material so that the tower is camouflaged or disguised to 
resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches (also known as a "monopine"). 

F .A.A. the Federal A via ti on Administration. 

F.C.C. the Federal Communications Commission. 

Height. When referring to a tower or alternative support structure, the distance measured 
from the ground level at the base of the tower or alternative support structure to the 
highest point on the tower or alternative support structure, including if said highest point 
is an antenna placed on said structure or tower. 

Wireless Communications Facilities. Any and all buildings, improvements, structures, 
fixtures or other accessories (such as electrical boxes, equipment sheds, guy wires, etc.) 
installed, used or intended for use in conjunction with any of the following: 

a. Cellular Communications Facilities -- low-powered transmitters used to 
transmit signals in a cell for cellular radio-telephone services (cellular 



phones), personal connnunication services (PCS), enhanced specialized 
mobile radios (ESMR), trnnk mobile cellnlar radios, paging services and 
similar cellular-based communications to the general pnblic, whether 
digital or analog based. 

b. Connnercial Satellite Facilities -- satellite earth stations which are greater 
than two (2) meters in diameter, and are nsed to send and/or receive 
satellite signals and similar connnnnications. 

c. Microwave Relay Facilities -- nsed to transmit radio signals between two 
or more fixed points by microwave antennas and similar transmission 
services. 

7.92 General Standards and Reqnirements. 

3 

7.921 Permit Requirements. All wireless connnnnications facilities are snbject to the 
standards contained in this ordinance, and applicants or operators will be required 
to receive a Land Use Certificate from the Zoning Administrator prior to being 
granted a bnilding permit or anthorization to proceed with construction. 
Fnrthermore, the location of wireless comnmnications equipment and related 
strnctnres in all nse districts shall be governed by Article VI, Table 6.4 (Table of 
Permitted Uses and Conditions). 

7.922 Height. 

a. Antennas located on alternative snpport structures shall not exceed fifteen 
feet (15') above the existit,g strnctnre on which they are placed. 

b. Tower height shall be limited to one hnndred eighty feet (180'). 

7 .923 Setbacks. Wireless telecommunications towers, gnys and accessory facilities 
mnst satisfy the minimnm yard requirements of the zoning district in which they 
are located. The nse of concealment techniques does not except a wireless 
teleconnnnnications facility from any minimnm yard requirements. In addition, 
the minim nm setback for all towers from adjacent property lines shall be the 
greater of the following: 

a. the height of the tower, plns the height of any antennas attached thereto, 
where the connnnnications tower property adjoins any non-residential 
zoning district; or 

b. the height of the tower, plns the height of any antennas attached thereto, 
pins five hnndred feet (500') from any adjoining residential property line 
or zoning district; or 

c. Towers mnst be placed no closer than a distance eqnal to the height of the 
tower, pins the height of gny wires attached thereto, to any residential 
strnctnre. 

d. Where a connnunications antenna is to be installed within or on an 
existing strnctnre in any business district, the setbacks shall be as reqnired 
for the existing strnctnre and the nse district in which the strnctnre is 
located, withont regard to the antenna height. 

7 .924 Strnctnral Design of Towers. Every new tower constructed shall be of monopole 
design, nnless the applicant for good canse shown can demonstrate that the 
specific conditions reqnire another tower type. 

7. 925 Aesthetics. The aesthetic properties of each individual wireless connnnnications 
facility shall be approved as part of the site plan review process. 



4 

a Towers and antennas. The design of the tower and antennas shall be of a 
type that has the least visual impact on the surrounding area. The 
following minimum requirements must be observed: 

(I) Towers and antennas shall be painted a neutral or blending color so as 
to reduce visual obtrusiveness, unless otherwise provided or required by 
any applicable F.A.A. standards or the Planning Commission. If an 
anteuna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and 
supporting communications facility must be of a neutral color that is 
identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting 
structure, or as otherwise required by the Planning Commission. 

(2) No signage, symbols or advertisements may be attached to the pole, 
tower or antenna, unless otherwise required by local, state or federal laws, 
rules or regulations. 

(3) Towers camouflaged to resemble woody trees or indigenous 
vegetation in order to blend in with native landscape will be subject to 
review, as are other types of concealment techniques. (See Concealment 
or Camouflage Techniques.) 

b. Accessory Structures. 

(1) The design of the wireless communications facility and its accessory 
structures shall, to the extent possible, maximize the use of building 
materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively 
blend the tower and wireless conununication facilities with the 
surrounding natural setting and built environment. 

(2) In or adjacent to developed properties, accessory structures must be 
aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding 
environment. Materials such as wood, brick and stucco should be used as 
appropriate. The use of metal or metallic-looking material shall be 
avoided as much as possible. 

c. Non-vegetative screening. 

(1) Non-vegetative screening will be required when it is necessary to 
reduce the visual impact of a wireless communications facility on adjacent 
public ways, properties or the neighborhood in which it is located. In or 
adjacent to developed properties, non-vegetative screening shall be 
provided in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding character of 
development, buildings, natural vegetation and landscaping. Such 
screening, as required, is subject to site plan review, shall have a minimum 
height of eight feet (8'), and may consist of one of the following: brick, 
masonry walls, solid wood fencing, berms or opaque barriers. All nonÂ­
vegetative screening shall be properly maintained by the property owner 
or lessor. 

(2) In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be 
minimal, such as remote, agricultural or rural locations, or developed 
heavy industrial areas, the non-vegetative screening requirement may be 
reduced. 

(3) The screening requirements may be reduced on wireless 
communications facilities utilizing underground vaults rather than above 
ground equipment buildings. 

d. Landscaping. In addition to the landscaping and buffer requirements set 
forth in Article VI and X, the following provisions shall also apply: 



5 

(1) Landscaping will be required to reduce the visual impact of the 
wireless communications facilities on adjacent public ways, properties or 
the neighborhood in which it is located. In or adjacent to developed 
properties, landscaping shall be provided in a manner that is compatible 
with the surrounding character of development, buildings and natural 
vegetation. 

(2) The perimeter of the accessory structure compound shall be 
landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view 
of the compound from adjacent property and public ways. The standard 
buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip of at least ten feet (1 O') wide 
outside the perimeter of the compound. In locations where the visual 
impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirements may 
be reduced. 

(3) Where the property on which the wireless communication facility is 
located abuts, or is in close proximity to, a residential district or residential 
use, additional buffering may be required by the Zoning Administrator. 

( 4) A row of trees a minim nm of eight feet (8 ') tall and a maxim nm of ten 
feet (1 O') apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the compound 
fence. A continuous hedge of at least thirty (30") inches high at planting 
and capable of growing to at least thirty-six (36") inches in height within 
eighteen (18) months shall be placed in front of the tree line. 

(5) All landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety. All landscaping 
shall be xeriscape tolerant or irrigated and properly maintained by the 
property owner or lessor to ensure good health and variety. 

7.926 Lighting Restrictions. There shall be no lighting on any towers unless required by 
the F .A.A. or other authority for safety purposes. In cases where the F .A.A. does 
require a tower to be lighted, only red blinking lights shall be used at night; white 
strobe lights will not be permitted for nighttime lighting. Written docnmentation 
of any F .A.A. directives to light a tower differently than provided herein must be 
submitted with the application. 

Basic security lighting for the compound may be permitted, but shall not include 
any flashing lights or lights greater than twenty feet (20') in height. Security 
lighting shall be focused only on the wireless communications facility itself, 
excluding the tower and antennas, and shall be directed away from any adjacent 
property. A lighting photometrics plan will be required. 

7 .927 Lot Size. 

(a) Lot size must conform to the mm1mmn lot size required for the 
underlying use district in which the tower is located. 

(b) In addition, lot size must adequate to accommodate all setbacks, 
buffered areas, ground mounted accessory structures, antenna support 
structures and related guy wires or cables and space for additional coÂ­
locating service providers. 

( c) If only a portion of a parcel is being leased for a wireless 
communications facility, the leased parcel must be situated within the 
parent parcel so that the wireless communications facility complies with 
the applicable setback requirements contained herein. 



6 

( d) All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the 
proposed tower are to be wholly contained within the required security 
fence. (Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound.) 

7 .93 Environmental Impact. All wireless communications facilities shall comply with 
the National Environmental Policy Act. If an environmental assessment is required 
by the Federal Communications Commission, a copy of the assessment with all 
documentation of the F.C.C's subsequent approval must be submitted prior to the 
commencement of construction and approved by the City Engineer.

Sufficient anti-climbing measures must be incorporated into each facility, 
as needed, to reduce potential for trespass and injury. A sign shall be 
discretely placed on the outermost structural element indicating the name 
and telephone number of persons responsible for the safety and 
maintenance of the facility. 

e. Access. Provisions shall be made to provide proper clearances for 
ingress and egress of emergency vehicles. Whenever a tower site does not 
have frontage on a public street from which it derives access, a permanent 
twenty foot (20') wide access easement shall be required. 

7.95 Co-Location. 

a. No new tower shall be permitted unless t.'le applicant demonstrates 
that no existing antenna support structure or other structure can 
accommodate the applicant's needs. 

b. Documentation that reasonable efforts have been made to achieve 
co-location shall be submitted with each application for a new antenna 
support structure. Applications for new antenna support structures or

e. The construction of towers capable of supporting multiple 
providers will take precedence over single use communications towers. 

f. For any communications tower approved for shared use, the owner 
of the tower shall provide notice of the location of the communications 
tower to the City, and the owner shall agree to make such space 
reasonably and economically available to other providers. 

7.95 Application. All wireless telecommunications facilities are subject to the standards 
contained in this section and will be required to receive a Land Use Certificate from 
the Zoning Administrator prior to being granted a building permit. For all wireless 
communication facilities which do not require the construction of a new tower, the 
Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to require any documentation or 
information with the application for Land Use Certificate deemed necessary to 
ensure compliance with this ordinance. 

7.96 Application and Justification for Construction and Siting of a New Tower. 
Sufficient justification must be submitted and proved for the siting of all new 
communications towers in the City of Spanish Fort. Determination as to the 
adequacy of the justification for any new tower will be made as a part of the
