ence and declared to be a part of this Ordinance. The Official Zoning Map of the City of Anniston, Alabama is 
identified by the signature of the Mayor of the City of Anniston, attested by the City Clerk of the City of Annis-
ton and bears the seal of the City under the following words: This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map 
of the City of Anniston, Alabama referred to in Section 1 of Ordinance Number 81-0-40 of the City of Anniston 
Alabama adopted on the 18th day of July, 2016. The City Clerk is hereby authorized, directed, and empowered to

the official Zoning Map of the City of Anniston, Alabama promptly after the amendment has been approved by 
the City Council. No amendment to this Ordinance shall become effective until after such change and entry has 
been made on said map. No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map of the City of Annis-
ton, Alabama or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this ordinance. Any

which may from time to time be made or published, the Official Zoning Map of the City of Anniston, Alabama, 
which shall be maintained in Planning and Development Services, shall be the best and conclusive evidence 
thereof.

DISTRICT ABBREVIATION
Urban Core C
Urban Center 1 UC1
Urban Center 2 UC2
Urban Neighborhood 1 UN1
Urban Neighborhood 2 UN2
Suburban Corridor SC
Suburban Neighborhood Center SNC

II. Principles. Principles are statements of intent related to the character of the physical environment and   
 preferences for how Anniston should manage its land resources in the future. They are used in con-  
 junction with the districts to help communicate preferences for how and where development or    
 redevelopment should or should not take place. The districts have been created with these     
 principles in mind.

 A.  Priority investment areas are the focus for future development and will serve as catalysts for city-  
  wide reinvestment.
 B. Infill development and redevelopment of underutilized and/or deteriorating sites take priority   
  over development in greenfield locations.
 C. Downtown is “everyone’s neighborhood,” featuring a vibrant mix of businesses, residences, and   
  civic uses, and a distinctive character that is appealing to residents, visitors, and investors.
 D. The city’s stable neighborhoods will be maintained.
 E. The development of new residential areas and redevelopment of existing residential areas have   
  strong neighborhood qualities, including sidewalks, mixed housing types, parks, and easy    
  access to basic retail needs. 
 F. Development that includes a mix of uses (residential, commercial, civic, employment) both verti-  
  cally (within buildings) and horizontally (within sites) and is connected to existing urban areas is   
  encouraged.
 G. The city’s historic assets are conserved and respected through future development.
 H. More opportunities to walk, bike, and access public transportation are created.
 I. Quality design is emphasized for all uses to create an attractive, distinctive public (streets, side-  
  walks, parks, and street trees, etc.) and private (building faces, lawns and landscaping, parking   
  lots and driveways, etc.) realm.



City of Anniston Zoning Ordinance     3

I.  LOT

 A.  Defined. A parcel of land intended as a unit for the purpose, whether immediate or for the future,   
  of transfer of ownership, or possession, or for the purpose of development.

 B. Lot Area. Lot area is the area included within all lot lines, but does not include any public rights-  
  of-way.

 C.  Lot Width. Lot width is the length of the Primary Street frontage of a lot.

 D. Lot Depth. Lot depth is the measurement between the front and rear property lines measured   
  along a line midway between the side lot lines.

II.  BUILDING SETBACKS

 A.  General. Building setbacks are defined as the measurement from the lot line to the building facade  
  or elevation. In this ordinance, there are generally four (4) types of setbacks: primary street, side   
  street, side interior, and rear. Setbacks are to remain clear of permanent structures except for  
  permitted encroachments (see Sec. 3: II E). Setbacks are measured from the property lines and  
  do not include any public rights-of-way. 

 B.  Minimum/Maximum Setbacks. Where there are minimum and maximum setbacks rather than   
  Build-to-Areas (see Sec. 3: III), the minimum setback refers to the minimum distance the    
  structure must be set back from the property lines, while the maximum setback refers to the  
  maximum distance the structure may be set back from the property line. Generally maximum   
  setbacks are only applicable to Primary or Side Street frontages.

 C.  Corner Lots. A corner lot must have at least one designated Primary Street. The Zoning Official   
  shall determine the Primary Street and may consider the following in the determination:    
  street classification, orientation of other structures on the block, longest face of the lot,    
  orientation of any alleys within the block, and address of the lot.

 D. Through Lots. Through lots may have either two (2) Primary Street setbacks or one (1) Primary   
  Street setback and one (1) Side Street setback, as determined by the Zoning Official.

 E. Setback encroachments. The following building features and other implements may encroach into   
  a required setback, unless otherwise specified, as listed below:

  1.  Porches, stoops, arcades, awnings, balconies (50% of the depth may encroach up to six [6]   
   feet into the required setback).
  2.  Unenclosed decks (up to six [6] feet into a rear setback or up to four [4] feet into a side   
   setback. Such encroachment must be at least five [5] feet from any lot line).
  3.  Accessibility ramps (to the extent necessary to be functional).
  4.  Mechanical equipment (such encroachment must be at least five [5] feet from any lot line  
   and said equipment is only permitted on the side or rear of the structure).

Sec. 3: MEASUREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS

III.  BUILD-TO-AREA (BTA) 

 A.  General. The Build-to-Area(BTA) is the area along street frontages within which the building   
  must be located. When a district has a minimum percentage in the BTA, that percentage of the   
  frontage must be occupied by a building between the minimum and maximum setback range for   
  the BTA. The percentage is measured by dividing the width of the building by the width of the lot.

 B.  Corner Lots. On corner lots, where applicable, the building facade must occupy the BTA for both   
  streets within the first twenty (20) feet from the block corner.

 C. Civic Buildings. See Sec. 23: Development Types K for reductions to the BTA for Civic    
  Development types.  

IV. PARKING SETBACKS

 A.  General. Parking setbacks are defined as the measurement from the property line to the edge of a   
  parking surface or elevation of a parking structure. There are four (4) types of parking setbacks:   
  primary street, side street, side interior, and rear. 

 B.  Parking. All parking, whether surface or structured, must be located beyond the parking setback.   
  The parking setback applies only to the ground floor of a parking structure.

 C. Where parking setbacks apply, in no case shall the parking be set back less than the setback of the   
  building. 

V. BUILDING HEIGHT 

 A.  Measurement. Building Height is measured in feet from the ground at average grade to the top of   
  the highest point of a roof, whether flat or pitched. 

 B.  Basements and Attics. Basements do not count as an additional story where they are more than   
  fifty (50) percent underground. Attics do not count as an additional story where they have a 
  ceiling height clearance of seven (7) feet or less for fifty (50) percent or more of the floor area.



City of Anniston Zoning Ordinance     5

 C. Exceptions. The maximum height limits do not apply to spires, steeples, cupolas, domes, etc. not   
  intended for human occupancy or to water tanks or towers, monuments, or other structures that   
  by design or function, must exceed the height limits. The following may also exceed the    
  height limit by not more than ten (10) feet:

   1.  Electric utility equipment

  least ten [10] feet from the edge of the roof. If they are not located on the roof, height limits apply.

VI.  GROUND FLOOR ELEVATION

 A.  Measurement. Ground floor elevation is measured from the top of the sidewalk to the top of the   
  finished ground floor.

VII. TRANSPARENCY
 
 A. Definition. Transparency refers to the minimum amount, as a percentage, of windows and doors   
  that must cover a story’s facade. Transparency requirements do not apply to residential structures.  
  
 B. Measurement - ground floor. The ground story transparency is measured between two (2) and   
  twelve (12) feet above the adjacent sidewalk. 



6 

 

 C.  Measurement - upper story. Transparency on an upper story is measured from the top of the 
  finished floor to the top of the finished floor above or to the top of the wall plate if there is no   
  floor above.

 D.  Applicability. Transparency requirements apply to facades on Primary and Side Streets only, and   
  do not apply to residential structures. See Sec. 23: Development Types K for reductions to  the  
  transparency requirements for Civic Development types.  
 
 E.  Requirements. Glass may not be painted. Windows may not be made permanently opaque by   
  window treatments. 

 F.  Blank Wall. Blank wall area is defined as a wall that does not include a substantial material   
  change; windows or doors; columns, pilasters, or other articulation greater than twelve (12)  
  inches in depth. Blank wall applies to both horizontal and vertical measurements and to primary  
  and side street facing facades, both ground and upper stories.

 G. Exceptions. In the historic districts, the Anniston Historic Preservation Commission may alter the  
  transparency requirements for contributing buildings if the proposed changes meet the design   
  guidelines and the intent of the zoning ordinance. 

VIII. PEDESTRIAN ACCESS

  percent of the building facade. The porch must also be at least six (6) feet deep, not including any   
  steps or ramps. The porch may be covered but not fully enclosed. A porch may encroach by up  
  to fifty (50) percent of its depth into a required setback, but may not be closer than three    
  (3) feet to any lot line. A multi-family structure must have at least one porch or stoop, but is not

I. Intent. The Industrial 2 General district is comprised of sites generally larger than 20 acres that are the   
 sites for large footprint buildings intended for a range of industrial development. Industrial development   
 in this district tends to generate more traffic and other impacts on surrounding properties. Properties in   
 this district tend to be near major transportation infrastructure. The intent of this district is to provide   
 convenient sites for industrial development that minimize the effects on surrounding properties by  
 ensuring development is not located in close proximity to neighborhoods or other development    
 that would be adversely affected by industrial uses. Furthermore, this district intends to ensure that   
 development that is potentially harmful to the environment  or public health is located in a way to   
 mitigate and minimize these effects.

 may include infrastructure as well as passive recreational facilities and trails. Some places in the district  
 may be suitable for development or may have been developed but are now vacant and returning to a   
 natural state. The intent of this district is to preserve natural areas and open space in order to preserve  
 wildlife habitat, improve air and water quality, and protect scenic areas and view. Furthermore, the   
 intent of this district is to direct development into areas most suitable for development where there are  
 existing services, infrastructure, and connections.

I. Intent. The Major Institution/Civic Campus district encompasses major community-serving institutions   
 such as educational campuses and hospitals. The development patterns for these institutions are unique   
 to the site and may differ significantly from their surroundings. The intent of this district is to create  
 places for these types of uses, which are highly desirable as economic generators, but also to ensure   
 that these sites do little harm to surrounding districts by integrating better into their surroundings.  
   
II. Except for the development of a new public park or open space, this district is not intended to be expand-  
 ed beyond the existing boundaries.

III. General Procedure. In the Major Institution/Civic Campus district, all development is conditional based   
 on the submittal and approval of a development plan, reviewed and approved by the Anniston Planning   
 and Zoning Commission. The application and approval process is described in detail in Sec. 17: IV.

Sec. 23: DEVELOPMENT TYPES

I. Development Types. All development is classified into the following development types. Each of the   
 development types is further defined.

 A. Single Family Residential Detached - SF. Detached 1-2.5 story residential structures each intended   
  for one family.

 B. Single Family Residential Attached - SF-A. 1-3 story residential structures that are attached to   
  similar structures on at least one side (aka townhouses or rowhouses). Each attached structure   
  has a separate entry and is intended for one family.

  residential dwellings under one roof. May be built in a similar pattern as single-family structures.

 D. Multi-Family Residential - MF-B. Higher density residential format where five or more separate   
  dwelling units are contained within a structure. Units may have separate entries or may only be   
  accessed through a central lobby.

 E. Vertical Mixed Use - MU. Structures intended to include different uses within the same structure.   
  Typically ground floor uses are retail with offices or residential units occupying upper floors.
 
 F. Community Commercial - CC. Large scale, primarily retail, restaurant, and accommodation uses   
  that serve the broader community. Buildings tend to be 1-2 stories and larger than 30,000 square   
  feet.

 G. Neighborhood Commercial - NC. Small scale retail, restaurant, and accommodation buildings   
  which should be compatible with and primarily serve nearby neighborhoods. Buildings    
  are typically smaller than 30,000 sqaure feet.

  development, clean manufacturing or warehousing activities, includes “flex” configurations that   
  offer a hybrid office/industrial format. 

 J. General Industrial - I. Development intended for modern industrial activities such as clean   
  manufacturing and distribution. Larger in scale than Limited Industrial with minimal, utilitarian   
  architecture.

 K. Civic - C. Public and semi-public uses such as government buildings, libraries, police and fire   
  stations, schools, and places of worship. Civic sites may differ from surroundings in style and   
  relationship to the street. In the Core and Urban Center Districts, Civic development types may   
  reduce the BTA requirements by 25 percent. In the Core and Urban Center 1 District, the maxi-  
  mum building setback may be increased to 20 feet, but the parking setback shall not be decreased,  
  and no parking is permitted in front of the building on either the primary or side street. In the

Sec. 24: MCCLELLAN DISTRICT

I.  Introduction.

 A. Intent. The intent of the McClellan development approval process is to facilitate the development   
  of land in a manner that conforms to City plans (including the Master Plan and plans for    
  McClellan) but also provides flexibility on the development of the site, promoting high standards   
  in layout and construction and ensuring development is harmonious with existing topographical   
  and historic features and surrounding land uses.

 B. General Procedure. In the McClellan district, all development is conditional based on the    
  submittal and approval of a development plan, reviewed and approved by the Anniston Planning   
  and Zoning Commission. The application and approval process is described in detail in    
  Sec. 24: V. In this district, there are sub-districts that permit certain types of uses, which are   
  specified in this section.

II. McClellan Districts. Within the McClellan District, there exist the following sub-districts. While these   
 districts have similar characteristics to the districts outside of McClellan, McClellan has a unique    
 character that is expressed in each district’s requirements. The districts are further defined as to each  
 district’s intent: 

 A. McClellan Central District - MC. The intent of the McClellan Central District is to allow for the  
  redevelopment of a walkable, mixed-use neighborhood at the core of the previous fort. The  
  McClellan Central District is similar in type to the Suburban Neighborhood Center, but dev-  
  elopment and redevelopment should be in keeping with the character of historic buildings within  
  McClellan.

 B. McClellan Historic Neighborhood 1 District - MHN. The intent of the McClellan Historic Neigh-  
  borhood District is to, first, preserve the existing historic Buckner Circle neighborhood and,   
   second, to allow infill development within the context of this historic, mixed-use neighborhood  
  that honors the character of the historic district.
 
 C. McClellan Neighborhood District - MN. The intent of the McClellan Neighborhood District is   
  to guide the development of McClellan’s more suburban neighborhoods. The McClellan    
  Neighborhood District is similar in type to the Suburban Neighborhood 1 District, but    
  development and redevelopment should be in keeping with the character of buildings within  
  McClellan.

 D. McClellan Suburban Corridor District - MSC. The intent of the McClellan Suburban Corridor   
  District is to allow for commercial and other development along the most viable commercial  
  corridors such as McClellan Boulevard and Summerall Gate Road.  Development along    
  these corridors should be attractive and reminiscent of the character of historic structures    
  in McClellan while at the same time being viable for larger commercial or other uses.

 E. McClellan Industrial District - MIN. The intent of the McClellan Industrial District is to provide   
  land suitable for light industrial development that is accessible by major transportation    
  routes within the context of the historic fort. Development in this district should be sensitive to   
  the historic and natural character of the larger McClellan District.



City of Anniston Zoning Ordinance     35

 F. McClellan Natural/Open Space District - MNO. The intent of this district is to preserve natural   
  areas and open space in order to preserve wildlife habitat, improve air and water quality,    
  and protect scenic areas and view. Furthermore, the intent of this district is to direct development  
  into areas most suitable for development where there are existing services, infrastructure, and   
  connections. 
  
 G. McClellan National Guard District. The intent of the McClellan National Guard District is to   
  provide property for the operations of the National Guard. As this District is under the purview   
  of the US National Guard, the City does not have any jurisdiction over this District.

III. Conditional Uses. The uses that may be conditionally approved (C) in each of the McClellan sub-districts   
 are listed below. The approval of these uses is at the discretion of the Planning Commission based on   
 an approved development plan. However, these uses are deemed to be the most appropriate uses for these  
 districts and shall be approved if the development plan meets all development requirements and guide-  
 lines.

Sec. 28: NON-CONFORMING LOTS, USES OF LAND, AND STRUCTURES AND PREMISES

I.  Intent. Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted there  
  exist:

•	 Lots
•	 Structures
•	 Uses of land and structures

 which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, reg- 
 ulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this ordi- 
 nance to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their  
 survival. Any expansion or extension of a non-conforming use shall require the granting of a special  
 exception by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.  It is further the intent of this ordinance that non-con 
 forming structures and properties shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as  
 grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district, except as herein  
 provided by this section. 

 Non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the dis- 
 tricts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-conform- 
 ing use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordi- 
 nance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the  
 premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district 
 involved.

 To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,  
 construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to  
 the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construc- 
 tion has been carried on diligently.

II. Non-conforming Lots of Record. In any district in which detached dwellings are permitted, a detached  
 dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective  
 date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, not-withstanding limitations imposed by other provi- 
 sions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other  
 lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements  



City of Anniston Zoning Ordinance     49

 for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and   
 requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regula-  
 tions for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained    
 only through action of the Board of Adjustment. 

 If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single owner-  
 ship are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part or the lots  
 do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered   
 to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be   
 used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established   
 by this ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area  
  below the requirements stated in this ordinance.

III. Non-conforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amend-  
 ment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions   
 on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the struc-  
 ture, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following  
 provision:

 A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is  
  located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered   
  except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.

IV. Non-conforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Premises in Combination. If lawful use involving   
 individual structures, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption   
 or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this    
 ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the follow-  
 ing provisions:

 A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is  
  located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered   
  except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.

 B. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use is   
  superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the   
  non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.

 C. When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discon-  
  tinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months, the structure, or structure and premises in   
  combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district   
  in which it is located.

 D. Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or  
  destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the land. Destruction   
  for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent  
  of the replacement cost at time of destruction.



50 

Sec. 29: SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS

  tial district except behind the nearest portion of a building to the street, provided however that   
  such equipment may be parked anywhere on residential premises for a period not to exceed 24   
  hours during loading or unloading. No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, or   
  housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot or in any location not approved  
  for such use.  

 B. Automotive vehicles or trailers of any kind or type without current license plates or which are   
  inoperable or otherwise disabled for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days shall not be parked

  erty used for residential purposes in a nonresidential zoned district other than in a completely  
  enclosed buildings. For the purpose of this subsection, a vehicle shall be deemed inoperable or   
  otherwise disabled if it is unable to operate on the streets and roadways of a city in the State of   
  Alabama in full compliance with the various provisions of the Code of Alabama, 1975 and/or   
  The Code of the City of Anniston, Alabama, 1981, as the same may from time to time be

 tions Commission Report and Order of 2014, which states that a local government may not deny, and   
 shall approve, any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station   
 that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station. The term   
 “eligible facilities request” means any request or modification of an existing wireless tower or base station   
 that involves collocation of new transmission equipment, removal of transmission equipment, or    
 replacement of transmission equipment.

 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve the FCC from the requirements of the National

 mendations to the City Council of the City of Anniston.

 change.

  application shall be filed with the Secretary of Planning and Development Services in the City

   shall submit a map, drawn to scale, indicating: the dimension and exact location of the site  
   to be considered for rezoning; location of all public right-of-ways; and the approximate  
   location of all proposed structures.

   shall submit a written statement indicating: reason for the rezoning request; availability   
   of required utilities; a legal description of the proposed rezoning site; and explanation of

   shall submit a written time schedule for beginning and completion of the proposed   
   development planned by the applicant.

  tion is considered, this failure to appear shall result in the denial of the application based on the  
  lack of sufficient information upon which to render an opinion.

  plus the majority votes of the Planning Commission members present approving said proposed   
  change. Upon receipt of the approval of the Planning Commission as to a proposed zoning

  votes of the Planning Commission, the applicant may request the City Council to review the   
  rezoning request and take appropriate action thereon.
