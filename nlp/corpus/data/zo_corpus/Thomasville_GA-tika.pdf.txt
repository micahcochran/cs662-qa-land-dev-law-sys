encroachment of those uses which are incompatible with a desirable residential environment. 

(4) R-1 Single-family residential. The purpose of this district is to provide single-family 

residential areas with minimum lot sizes of seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet, such 

areas being protected from the depreciating effects of small lot development and excessive density

(9) C-2 Commercial. The purpose of this district shall be to enhance and protect 

shopping 

facilities in the central business district of the City. 

(10)  M Manufacturing. The purpose of this district shall be to provide and protect areas for 

those industrial or other uses which do not create excessive noise, odor, smoke, dust, and which do 

not possess other objectionable characteristics which might be detrimental to surrounding 

neighborhoods, or to the other uses permitted in the district. 

(11) M-1 Manufacturing. The purpose of this district shall be to provide and protect areas for 

those industrial uses which cannot comply with the regulations of the M district. 

(12) MH Zone (One-family manufactured housing residential district). The purpose of this 

zone is to provide a zone where lots may be purchased by individuals for the purpose of permanently 

locating a manufactured home or constructing a single-family residence with minimum lot sizes of 

seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet. 

(13)   L.U. Zone. The purpose of this zone is to allow the applicant to request that a certain 

area be designated as “Limited Use” (L.U.), which area, after having been recommended by the 

planning and zoning commission and approved by the City Council, must be used for only those 

conditions prescribed by the City Council, which uses must be among those uses permitted in the zone 

from which the limited use zone is taken.  Provided, further, however, that should any area designated 

as “limited use” fail to be used continuously for the limited use or uses approved by the City Council 

pursuant to this subsection, the subject area shall automatically revert to the zoning district from 

which the subject area was taken and designated “limited use.” Any applicant for a limited use may 

ask for and receive consideration by the planning and zoning commission under the same terms and 

conditions prescribed for any rezoning request. The applicant may in all eventualities attach to his 

application a site plan, architectural renderings or such other material as might be of assistance to both 

the planning commission and the City Council in their considerations. 

 (14) R-TH Townhouse district. The purpose of this district shall be to: 
a. Encourage home ownership in the City through innovative housing arrangements 

which utilize design and building concepts which may be different from the standard 

single-family residence concept; 

 b. Provide a wider variety of types of dwelling units than are available at the time of 
the enactment of the ordinance establishing this district; and 

c. Allow for innovative uses of real property which may not be suitable for 

development for other kinds of residential use. See section 22-206 et seq. for 

development standards. 

(15)  R-CD Cluster housing. The purpose of this district shall be to provide savings in   
infrastructure installation, land resources and energy use through the allocation of dwellings, 
construction and physical impact to a given tract of real property to permit variation in lot size, shape, 
width, depth, and building setbacks without an increase in overall density of population or 
development while ensuring to the greatest extent possible compatibility with adjacent developments 
and existing neighborhoods. See section 22-231 et seq. for development standards. 

(16) R-TND Traditional Neighborhood Development. The purpose of the TND District is to 

create an innovative residential zoning classification that will: 
a.   Encourage a pattern of neighborhood development that will be consistent with the 

traditional qualities of the City of Thomasville Historic Districts and that will be 
compatible with surrounding residential areas of the City. 

b.   Be distinguished from other residential zoning districts through a unified plan for a 

neighborhood that includes a diversity of land uses and lot sizes, housing types and 

sizes to accommodate persons of a variety of stages of life in a pedestrian-oriented 

setting that is well integrated with the City’s neighborhoods, parks, civic spaces, 

and commercial uses. 

c.   Result in fewer burdens on present and projected public services and utilities than

would result from conventional subdivision development.  See section 22-235 et 

seq. for development standards.

the office of the zoning administrator at all times. Such map shall accurately show all map 

amendments made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and the date when the 

amendments became effective. It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to see to it that the 

Comprehensive Zoning Map Thomasville, Georgia, is displayed in his office and is kept up to date

(a)  All recording references to deeds, maps, plats or other such data in this chapter unless 

otherwise indicated may be found in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Thomas County. 
(b) Reference once made to a plat of a subdivision shall extend to any other reference to the 
subdivision by name without the place of record of the plat again being made. 

(c)  Where the boundary of a railroad right-of-way is the boundary of a district or zone or districts 

or zones and the total width of the right-of-way is not included by the word description in any

zone. 

(d) Where a conflict exists between the map description and the word description of a 

zone or district, the word description shall control. 

(e)  The word description of zones or districts shall be used in interpreting the map descriptions. 
(f)  If any land area lying within the limits of the city (exclusive of railroad right-of-way) has 

been omitted from zoning classification in this chapter, the omission is unintentional. If by 

reference to the word descriptions and the map descriptions it cannot be determined whether any 

particular land area within the limits of the city has been zoned or classified such particular land area 

shall be construed to be included and zoned as a separate parcel or parcels in the A zone. 

(g) If a district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot of record held in one (1) 

ownership on the date of passage of the ordinance from which this section derives, each part of the 

lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this chapter for the 

district in which each such parcel is located; except, however, that if the property owner of such a lot, 

other than a through lot, so desires, he may extend a use allowed on the greater portion of such lot 

fifty (50) feet beyond the district into which he is encroaching. 

(h) Where any public street or alley is vacated officially hereafter or abandoned, the zone 

classification and regulations of the larger portion shall apply to the remaining smaller portion of the 

lot. 

(i)  Where a street is in existence at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which 
this section derives, and such existing street has less width than sixty (60) feet, it shall nevertheless be

Architectural styles should be consistent with the character of architectural styles found within the City of 

Thomasville as listed in the City of Thomasville Commercial Design Guidelines, to the extent deemed 

applicable by the Architectural Review Board. The following architectural standards shall be applied to 

all new commercial buildings within the City of Thomasville, excluding designated industrial areas, and 

shall be applied to development and redevelopment: 

(a) Exterior finish material on every facade facing a public right of way and 30 percent on the 

remaining facades shall be limited to stone, brick, stucco, synthetic stucco, pre-cast concrete, clapboard 

siding, textured block, and wood shingles. 

(b) No blank facades are permitted for all facades facing a public right-of-way.  All building facades 

facing a public right of way shall have glazed areas or areas of glazed appearance and openings of at least 

20 percent and no more than 75 percent of the facade area.  The Planning Department is authorized to 

allow a variance up to 5% of the required glazed, glazed appearing, and opening façade area. The glazed 

and glazed appearance areas, and openings shall meet the following requirements: 
(1) Storefronts shall be directly accessible from the sidewalk and shall have glazed areas no more 

than ten feet from the ground, equal to a maximum of 75 percent of its primary facade area. 

(2) Windows shall be recessed a minimum of two inches from the exterior face of the façade except 

when clapboard siding is used on the facade. 

(3) Multiple windows in the same rough opening shall be separated by a minimum of a two inch 
wide post and sit on one continuous sill. 

(4) All visible building facades shall have a Typical Window.   It is recommended that the typical 

window be rectangular and vertically oriented or square in proportion, but may include side or fan lights. 

Once a Typical Window is designated, any window, which is not typical shall be considered an "Accent 

Window."  The primary facade shall have no more than three (3) Accent Windows.  All other visible 

facades may have up to five (5) Accent Windows.  An Accent Window may not be larger in area than 
four times a Typical Window.  Sidelights and fanlights abutting a door shall not be considered as separate 

windows. 

(5) If shutters are used, they shall be sized to match the opening, and be provided for all windows on 

a given wall. 

(6) If security bars are used, they shall be located on the interior of the structure and designed in such 

a manner so they appear as muntins in a divided light window.  Mesh and chain link are not permitted to 

cover openings. 

(c) Mechanical systems, backflow preventers, television antennae, satellite dishes and communication 

devices shall be screened from view by landscaping or built elements designed as an integral part of 

the building architecture. 

(d) Any building constructed as new Development or Redevelopment as defined in Section 22-6 is 

required to have a symmetrical pitched roof with a slope of no less than 5:12. Any building constructed 

as new Development or Redevelopment as defined in Section 22-6, which utilizes a barrel tile roof shall 

have a symmetrical pitch of no less than 3:12.  Any building with a roof pitch of less than 5:12, whether 

new Development or Redevelopment, with the exception of one which utilizes a barrel tile roof, shall 

utilize a parapet or false mansard of no less height than necessary to obscure the roof line from view of 

the public right of way and no more than six (6) feet in height as measured from the bottom of the parapet 

or mansard or no more than the maximum height as permitted under Section 22-181 for the zone in which 

the building is constructed.

should be incorporated on all visible building facades, but does not apply to any facade facing service 

courts or other areas generally not visible to the public. 

(f)     In order to avoid “cookie cutter” style buildings and in recognition of the fact that corporations 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

 

have available a minimum of two design options, individual “corporate image” architectural design 

elements and colors shall be incorporated only as secondary elements to the buildings and not as the 

dominant element. 

(g)     No fencing in any commercial and manufacturing zones shall exceed seven (7) feet in height.  A 

list of approved fencing materials is maintained in the Planning Department. Chain link fencing will only 

be permitted in the rear setbacks and must be coated.

Section 22-185 Purpose and Intent 

This code section provides the procedures and minimum requirements for a PUD Conditional Use 

approval to implement the goals of development and redevelopment, preserving the natural environment, 

encouraging high quality development through innovative design and ensuring adequate access to 

facilities and services. 

It is intended that development in a PUD district be superior to that which would occur under 

conventional zoning regulations. 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

 

 
Developments occurring under this code section should: 

A. Have unique, flexible, creative and imaginative arrangements and mixes of land uses in site 

planning and development where the various land uses are complimentary to each other 

B. Develop tracts of land as single developments that promote self-contained communities including 

residential uses and civic, educational, recreational and/or other public and private facilities. 
C. Preserve the natural amenities of the land through maintenance of conservation areas, open spaces 
and recreational facilities (i.e. baseball fields, soccer fields, gymnasiums…) 

D. Provide for the more efficient use of land through clustering and other flexible, innovative 

development arrangements that will result in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lowering 

development costs and housing/commercial costs 

E. Provide for a more desirable living environment than would be possible through the strict 

application of conventional requirements 
F. Provide for slightly higher gross and net development densities and intensities as an inducement 
to develop in a manner consistent with the purposes of this ordinance 

G. Ensure that the designs of building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmonious 
 

 
 
 
Sec. 22 -186 Definitions 

Development Plan means a to – scale drawing of single and/or multi-family residential, 

institutional, office, commercial or industrial development, or some combination thereof, showing the 

general layout of a proposed development including among other features the location of buildings, 

parking areas, buffers and landscaping and open/recreational spaces. The development plan and related 

information form the basis for the approval or disapproval of the development of a PUD. 

Planned Unit Development means a form of development characterized by a unified site design 

for a number of housing units, clustered buildings, common open / recreational spaces and a mix of 

building types and land uses. 

 
 
Sec. 22 -187 Permitted Locations and Uses 

Planned unit developments shall be permitted in all zoning districts excluding R-1A.  Any use 

may be permitted in a PUD if said use is shown on the Development Plan and referred to in the PUD 
application and approved in accordance with this ordinance. The permitted uses of property located in a 

PUD shall be proposed by the applicant and approved at the time the PUD application is approved if the 

proposed uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan and meet the criteria for approval specified in 

this code section. The Planning & Zoning Commission, in recommending approval of any PUD, may 
designate the maximum height, floor area and/or other restrictions on the development of such uses. 

 
 
Sec. 22-188 Requirements 

A. Dimensional - A planned unit development may depart from strict conformance with the 

required dimensions, setbacks, area, height, bulk, use and specific content regulations of the city’s land 

use regulations to the extent specified in the PUD application if approved, so long as the PUD provides 

tangible benefits in the form of provisions of open / recreational space, amenities, superior design, etc. 

Said benefits must be identified in accordance with the Community Benefit Statement as provided for in 

this ordinance.  Departure from any requirements specified in this ordinance and other city regulations is 
a privilege and shall be granted only upon approval by the City Council after review and recommendation 

by the Planning & Zoning Commission. 

A PUD development plan shall not have to follow the regulations for the zoning district in which 

the development is located, unless otherwise provided in this code section. There shall be no 
requirements for minimum lot size, minimum lot width, lot coverage, yards and building setbacks or 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

 

height requirements that apply to a PUD unless said requirements are specified by Planning & Zoning or 

Mayor & Council at time of approval.  Dimensional requirements shall be as proposed by the applicant 
and recommended for approval by the Planning & Zoning Commission during the PUD application plan 

review process. 

 
B. Minimum Open Space - A minimum of twenty (20) percent of the total land area included 

within the PUD shall be open / recreational space, including active or passive recreation. This requirement 

can include open land which is otherwise unbuildable (i.e. floodplains and wetlands) so long as the 

applicant proposes appropriate improvements to these areas such as trails, ball fields...  Proposed PUDs 

within 1/4-mile radius of an existing City of Thomasville Park may calculate the existing park acreage in 

complying with this code section so long as the applicant proposes direct pedestrian access to the park 

being utilized in complying with this code section. In no case shall the level of service for the existing park 

fall below 2 acres per 1,000 persons within a ¼ mile circumference around park. This calculation shall be 

provided by the applicant at the time of the pre-application conference. Said pedestrian access shall 

comply with City of Thomasville standards for sidewalk construction. Where existing sidewalks provide 

access to and from the PUD, applicant shall review the City of Thomasville Sidewalk Inventory, a copy of 

which is on file in the Planning Department, and propose improvements where the Sidewalk Inventory 

identifies “no sidewalk” or “needs improvement”.  Logical termini shall be proposed by the applicant in 

the PUD application and approved by the Planning & Zoning Commission. Pedestrian scale streetlights 

shall be proposed by the applicant along the pedestrian corridor linking the PUD to the Park.   It is defined, 

unless otherwise approved by the Planning & Zoning Commission, that the pedestrian corridor extends 

through the PUD at its widest width and connecting to the park. 

 
C Density - The minimum allowable density for residential components of PUDs shall be 

six (6) dwelling units per gross acre of land devoted to residential uses. Within any PUD, a minimum of 

30% of the total development site (excluding non-developable lands such as wetlands and floodplains) 

shall be designated on the Development Plan as residential use. 
 

 
 
Sec 22-189 General Considerations for Land Use Mix and Design 

A. Comprehensive Plan - Uses within the PUD shall be predominantly in accordance with the 

use recommendations and policies of the comprehensive plan. 

 
B. Housing Unit Diversity - Where appropriate, the PUD should provide for more than just 

one type of dwelling unit, such as townhouses, duplexes and multi-family dwellings in addition to or in 

lieu of detached, single family dwellings. Multi-family dwellings should comprise at least twenty (20) 

percent, but no more than sixty (60) percent of the total dwelling units within the PUD without explicit 

approval from the Planning & Zoning Commission.   In PUDs designed for post-secondary educational 

uses with limited quasi-public facilities, multi-family dwelling units are to be construed as dormitories and 

may comprise one hundred (100) percent of the dwelling units and shall be excluded from the housing 

affordability component prescribed in this ordinance. 

All PUDs shall contain a housing affordability component.  A minimum of ten (10) percent of the 
dwelling units shall be reserved for those whose household income is between eighty (80) percent and one 
hundred twenty (120) percent of the area median income as defined by the most recent U.S. Census or 
other approved source. The exterior of these dwelling units shall be composed of similar materials and 
design and shall be indiscernible from all other dwelling units within the PUD. 

In areas where a PUD is proposed that contains existing housing, a housing survey must be 

completed prior to submittal of a formal application. The housing survey must include all existing 

structures within the area to be designated as a PUD. The housing survey should include property address 

and year of construction.  For structures and dwelling units aged 50 years or more, photo documentation of 

all sides of the structure and/or dwelling unit shall be provided, bounded in a booklet titled “Proposed PUD 

– Historic Structures & Housing Survey”.  For each photo documented structure and dwelling unit, The 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

 

Chief Building Official shall provide an assessment identifying each structure and dwelling unit as 

Standard, Substandard, Dilapidated or Deteriorated as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing & 

Urban Development. The Proposed PUD – Structures & Housing Survey shall then be delivered to the 

applicant who shall conduct an assessment by a qualified person skilled in historic preservation and tasked 

in determining contributing and non-contributing structures and dwelling units. Those structures and 

dwelling units identified as contributing and standard or substandard shall be identified on the Concept & 

Development Plan and shall be reserved for rehabilitation (existing lot sizes can be altered to reflect the 

typical lot size of the proposed development).  It is the intent of this code section to promote the 

preservation of Thomasville’s historic homes. However, should the cost of rehabilitating those structures 

and/or dwelling units, based on a submitted feasibility study, be determined to be cost prohibitive, a sign 

shall be posted in a conspicuous location on site, visible from the public rights of way, for a minimum of 

30 days stating the following:  “This home is a contributing structure / dwelling unit within a proposed 

PUD.  Rehabilitation of this structure has been determined to be cost prohibitive based on a feasibility 

study. The feasibility study is on file in the Planning Department of the City of Thomasville. This 

structure / dwelling unit is slated for demolition or removal unless written notice is provided to the City of 

Thomasville Planning Department indicating your intention to purchase and rehabilitate according to the 

standards prescribed for this PUD or your intention to purchase and remove this structure / dwelling unit 

from this site within thirty (30) days of submission of your written inquiry.” For structures within a historic 

district, treatment of those structures shall be in accordance with the existing City of Thomasville Historic 

Preservation Ordinance. 

 
C. Civic, Educational and Institutional Uses - PUDs shall contain sites for, residential uses 

and at a minimum, at least one of the following:  church, educational facility, community or club buildings 

and/or similar public or quasi-public facilities. 

 
D. Retail Component - Retail trade establishments and personal service establishments shall 

be located in careful relation to other land uses within and outside of the proposed development.  Such uses 

need to be scaled and designed to/for the pedestrian and to the PUD itself.  Appropriate hardscape and 

landscape elements shall be proposed which complement and enhance the relationship between the 

residential and non-residential uses within and outside but adjacent to the PUD.  The amount of land in a 

PUD devoted to retail trade and personal service establishments shall be a minimum of five (5) percent but 

not exceed thirty (30) percent of the total site area of the development.  In PUDs devoted primarily to 

educational uses, the retail component may include concession stands, laundry facilities, vending areas and 

other retail uses such as a student bookstore, student cafeteria or private or public daycare center or other 

use proposed by applicant that could reasonably be considered a retail or personal service establishment. 

 
E. Industrial Uses - Industrial uses are not typically considered to be appropriate for inclusion 

within PUDs; however, such uses are not prohibited and may be considered appropriate and desirable uses 

in PUDs consisting of twenty (20) acres or more where living and working areas need to be proximate to 

one another, subject to separation and landscape / screening requirements to ensure that landscape and 

hardscape elements compliment and enhance the relationship between the residential and non-residential 

uses. 

 
F. Interconnectivity - All new streets within the proposed PUD shall contain a travel lane(s) 

of no more than 12’ for one-way traffic and no more than 24’ for two-way traffic. All streets, existing or 

proposed, shall include curb and gutter, a minimum of 2’ wide grass strip between the curb and sidewalk 

and a minimum of a 4’ wide sidewalk. Crosswalks shall be appropriately defined. Painted crosswalk 

sections do not constitute appropriately defined crosswalks.  Streetscape elements such as street trees, 

pedestrian oriented lighting and decorative traffic signs (including street names) shall be provided for all 

streets within the PUD. Traffic signs including, street names, yield and stop signs should be located on a 

shared, decorative pole.  While pedestrian oriented lighting is encouraged along all pedestrian facilities, at 

a minimum, decorative street lighting is required at all street intersections or along the entire 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

 

street/pedestrian section.  It is preferable that street lighting be solar powered.  It is preferable that traffic 

signs be co-located on decorative, pedestrian oriented light poles on all corners of the intersection. 

Renderings of typical traffic signs, crosswalk sections and street lighting shall be provided with the 

Concept & Development plan submitted for approval. A typical street section detail shall be provided with 

the Concept & Development plan submitted for approval. 

 
G. Landscape Elements - A landscape plan shall be proposed and submitted for approval 

prior to issuance of a building permit.  At the time of the PUD application, the applicant must provide a 

written statement identifying the general guidelines for landscape installation for each type of use 

proposed in the PUD (residential, commercial, retail…) and provide a general rendering of the proposed 

landscape for each type of use (residential, commercial, retail…). The general rendering provides for a

Section 22-233 Common areas. 

(a)  A cluster housing development allows individual lot areas which may have less than the 

minimum lot area for dwelling units required in the zoning district from which the cluster housing zoning 

district was created; provided, however, the land area at least equal to the reduction in each individual lot 

area shall be placed in common areas or open space. 

(b) The land in streets, common off-street parking areas, and storm drainage detention facilities shall 

not be included as part of the open space or common area requirement. However, full credit for lot 

reduction shall be allowed for detention facilities meeting the following criteria: 

(1) The maximum depth of the detention facility shall not exceed two and one-half (2 1/2) feet below 

the existing ground elevation measured beneath the rim of the depression. 

(2) The detention facility shall be designed and constructed to drain completely after each rain event. 
(3) The detention facility shall be designed and constructed with a minimum of three to one (3:1) 

slopes.

(5) Any other unique detention facility that is designed to be usable and maintained for recreation or 

landscaping features or both may be allowed for lot reduction credit if approved by the city 

engineer to meet this intent. In addition, each two (2) square feet of existing and natural water 

surface, or periodically flooded (based upon the one hundred (100) year flood contour elevation) 

or inundated land may be credited as one (1) square foot of land area for lot reduction purposes. 

Land below the one hundred (100) year flood elevation can only be substituted for one-half (1/2) 

of the required open space or common areas. 

(c)  The plan for cluster housing development shall provide for ownership, maintenance and control 

of common areas or open space or both. 
(d) Within districts allowing cluster housing developments, the usable common area or open space

(a) The purpose of the TND District is to create an innovative residential zoning classification that 

encourages a pattern of neighborhood development that will be consistent with the traditional qualities of 

the City of Thomasville Historic Districts and that will be compatible with surrounding residential areas 

of the City. The TND District is distinguished from other residential zoning districts through a unified 

plan for a neighborhood that includes a diversity of land uses and lot sizes, housing types and sizes to 

accommodate persons of a variety of stages of life in a pedestrian-oriented setting that is well integrated 

with City neighborhoods, parks, civic spaces, and commercial uses. The TND District results in fewer 

burdens on present and projected public services and utilities than would result from conventional 

subdivision development. 

 
(b) The TND Design Guidelines are hereby adopted and shall apply to property in the TND. A copy of the 

TND Guidelines shall be kept on file in the administrative offices of the City of Thomasville Planning 

Department.      Within  the  TND  District,  design  and  construction  of  new  buildings  that  are  not  in 

substantial conformity with the TND Design Guidelines is prohibited. In cases of a conflict between the

and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of 

land or building or structure that is prohibited by this article; 

(5) A literal interpretation of this article would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the 

same district are allowed; 

(b) Provided that the board of appeals may impose or require such additional restrictions and 

standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community,

Section 22-500:  Intent  

Thomasville seeks to promote preservation, infill development, and revitalization throughout the city, in its 
traditional communities, and upon individual blocks and lots. As such, it is the intent of the Victoria Place overlay 
district to enable, encourage, and qualify the following policies: 

1. In General and Throughout the City: 
a. Implement the Comprehensive Plan and the Victoria Place Redevelopment Plan; 
b. Enhance the viability of local businesses and reduce travel demand by focusing growth in existing 

neighborhoods with infrastructure, services, employment centers, and schools; 
c. Locate workforce housing near job opportunities while avoiding concentrations of poverty; 
d. Establish Thomasville as a city of compact, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods in which ordinary activities of 

daily living occur within walking distance of most homes, allowing independence to those who do not drive; 
and 

e. Create an interconnected network of 
streets and pathways that are safe and 
secure for vehicles, bicycles, and 
pedestrians; and reduce automobile 
traffic.   

2. Within the City’s Neighborhoods: 
a. Preserve and extend the historic  

neighborhood character through 
the design and placement of 
building types and public spaces; and 

b. Enable mixed-use corner stores and 
mainstreets to remain or return as  
vibrant social and commercial centers. 

3. At the Scale of the Block and Building: 
a. Use buildings to frame streets and 

public spaces, resulting in a high- 
quality, interesting, and human-scaled 
environment; 

b. Ensure that landmark buildings are sited 
at important locations, and that they  
promote a form that reflects their civic  
stature;  

c. Provide a measure of predictability to 
property owners and occupants about  
what may be built on their land or that  
of their neighbors;  

d. Promote sustainability by encouraging 
a range of building types and sizes that  
can readily adapt to changes in the  
economy, the surrounding community, 
or the needs of their owner; and 

e. Ensure that architecture and landscape 
grow from local climate, history, and building practice.

 Section 22-501: General to All Development 

1. The delineation of the Victoria Place overlay district (VPO) is conveyed below, and is outlined on the official 
zoning map of the City. 

2. The Victoria Place overlay district overlays three (3) current zoning districts that are referred to as “base 
zoning.” 

3. State and Local Codes.  
a. Except where specifically  

addressed herein, the standards 
of the underlying zoning district 
shall apply. In the case of conflict, 
the standards of the VPO shall 
take precedent. 

b. In the case of conflict between 
the standards of the VPO and 
those contained elsewhere in the 
Thomasville Municipal Code, the 
standards contained in the VPO 
shall always prevail.  

c. Development must comply with 
all state and local building codes.   

4. Creating Streets.  New or improved 
public or private vehicular rights of 
way, easements, access-ways, and 
driveways that: 
a. Will front a building type or civic 

space type depicted in this Code; 
or 

b. Are necessary to maintain or 
establish an uninterrupted and 
interconnected network of blocks 
and streets… 

…shall, to the maximum extent 
practicable, be designed as complete 
(multi-modal) thoroughfares that 
incorporate on-street parking, 
sidewalks, lighting, plantings, 
streetscape elements (furniture, 
wayfinding signage, etc.), 
terminated vistas, and where 
appropriate, bicycle lanes. 

 

8. Dead-End Streets and Cul-de-Sacs. Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall not be permitted. 
9. Terminated Vistas. In order to improve spatial definition and orientation on each street, terminated vistas shall 

be encouraged using buildings, civic spaces, roundabouts, statues, ornamentation, or natural features. 
10. Traffic Calming. To the maximum extent practicable on-street parking shall be encouraged as a means of 

calming traffic. 
11. Lot Frontage. The primary frontage of a lot shall be along one of the following: 

a. A thoroughfare right-of-way; 
b. A thoroughfare with development on one side and a civic space on the other (see diagram below, left);  
c. Directly upon a civic space in which there is no thoroughfare located between the primary frontage and 

the civic space (see diagram below, center); or 
d. Directly upon a pedestrian passage or rear alley / lane (see diagram below, right).  

 Victoria Place overlay district boundary map 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

Page 106 of 137 
 

12. Reverse Frontage Lots. Reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited. Arterials, collectors, and local streets shall be 
incorporated into the structure of all future blocks, with access to the first tier of lots provided directly from 
the thoroughfare, a perpendicular street, or a rear alley / lane. 

13. Rear Alleys and Lanes. Rear alleys and lanes shall be provided along the rear property lines of lots intended for 
new development when the lots are part of a block face with an average lot width of 55 feet or less at the 
building setback line. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

14. Exceptions from Build-to-lines. The Supervisory Planner may grant an exception to the required build-to line in 
order to avoid trees with a caliper greater than 8”; in the case of an irregularly shaped lot; or where existing 
adjacent buildings are set behind the required build-to-line, a building may be set to align with the façade of the 
front-most adjacent property. All other standards, including parking location and design shall be adhered to.  

14. Exceptions to Lot Coverage Requirements. In the R2 zone the required maximum lot coverage shall be 60%. If 
the design is consistent with the intent of this overlay district (Section 22-500), the Architectural Review / 
Zoning Appeals Board may grant a variance permitting a proposal for multi-family residential, mixed use, or 
commercial structures to exceed this percentage. 

15. Building Height. 
a. Determining Overall Building Height. Building height shall be measured in number of stories from the 

natural grade or finished grade adjacent to the building exterior 
to the highest point of coping of a flat roof, the top of a 
mansard roof, or the highest point of the highest pitched roof. 

b. Number of Stories Permitted. The maximum number of stories 
(floors) is determined by building type. Building Types are 
found in Section 22-502.  

c. Determining the Height of each Story. All heights are measured 
finished floor to highest point of the finished ceiling.  

d. Ground floor Finish Level. Minimum and maximum ground 
floor finish level (measured from adjacent finished grade) are 
established by building type. Where maximum ground floor 
finish level exceeds the permitted height, the undercroft 
(basement, crawl space, or storage area) shall count as a story. 

e. ½ Story. A 1/2 story is the top floor of a building that has a maximum exterior wall height not to exceed 6 
feet, creating a sloped ceiling on the top level of the structure. Dormers may be used to provide egress 
windows as required by the adopted building code. See diagram at right. 

f. Appurtenances. Architectural, Mechanical, and 
Structural Appurtenances may exceed the allowable building height, as conveyed in Section 22-504 
(Architecture). 

16. Utilities. 
a. To the maximum extent practicable, all utility connections including, but not limited to, electric, phone, 

cable, etc., shall be placed underground.   
b. Where a utility easement exists at the front of the lot, the furthest most portion of said easement (from the 

ROW) shall serve as the lot line for purposes of establishing the front setback.

Section 22-502 (j):  Landmark Building 

Landmark Buildings are designed for 
occupancy by public or commercial uses that 
provide important services to the 
community, including recreation, education, 
safety, assembly, and related functions. They 
contribute significantly to the quality of the 
neighborhood and often serve as the focal 
point of a civic space, terminate a vista, or 
are placed at a prominent location. The 
architectural quality and construction of a 
Landmark Building shall be of the highest 
level and exceed that of nearby buildings. 

 

Review Process: 

  Design and Disposition (Dimensional 
  Requirements) 

All Landmark Buildings shall be negotiated on a case-by case basis 
with the supervising planner prior to application.   

Building Location: 

  The following criteria should be considered when determining the location of a Landmark Building within the 
  community, on the block, and on the lot: 

1. Primary function; 
2. Perceived level of importance to the community; 
3. Desired level of formality; and 
4. Sense of permanence. 

  Location within the Community and Block Buildings shall be sited at prominent locations and oriented toward a 
public street or public space in a manner that: 
1. Provides a corner or midblock terminating vista;    
2. Anchors a civic space; or 
3. Fronts a street and civic space. 

  Location on the Lot (Setback) Landmark Buildings often benefit from being set back from the 
adjacent build-to lines of private development, thereby: 
1. Allowing the scale of the building to have more visual emphasis; 

and 
2. Creating a public space in the foreground. 
The amount of this setback should be carefully determined based on 
programming and the urban design objectives of the particular site. 

  Multiple Buildings / Campus Facilities with multiple buildings or a campus-like setting shall comply 
with the standards of Sub-section 502 (k) (Multi-building & Campus 
Development). 

Building Type and Character 

  The following facilities may be designed to an existing building type: 
1. Private and quasi-public Clubs or Lodges;  
2. Small scaled Cultural Facilities such as museums; 
3. Public Recreation Centers and Similar Facilities that are minor or secondary in nature; and 
4. Small to medium-scaled Bus Passenger Stations in which passenger boarding occurs outside the building. 
Structures that draw inspiration from an existing building type may be integrated into the urban fabric or 
streetscape with little to no additional emphasis. All other Landmark Buildings shall be designed as freestanding, 
“monumental” structures that evoke pride in one’s community and convey a sense of timelessness.

Vehicle Access and Parking 

To the maximum extent practicable: 
1. Parking shall not be located between a principal or secondary façade and a primary or secondary street; 
2. Parking requirements for the site shall be met with on-street parallel and angled parking spaces, or via a remote 

parking lot or structure; 
3. Parking shall be accessed from a side street or alley;  
4. Parking drives and access shall be shared with adjacent lots; and 
5. Drop-off, pick-up, and stacking for the site shall occur on or along a public street (may be privately owned). 
If the building is sited in a public space, vehicular access shall be limited to service and emergency vehicles utilizing 
pedestrian walkways of sufficient width and construction. 

Building Design 

  Facades and Entrances   A façade that fronts a primary street shall be considered to be the 
building’s principal façade, and a façade that fronts a secondary street 
shall be considered to be the buildings secondary facade. 
1. The principal façade shall be designed to be the most prominent 

façade of the building. 
2. Building entrances shall always take access from the most 

prominent façades. 
Additional entrances may be provided along secondary and axillary 
facades. 

  Required Frontages Building fronts shall have at least one of the following: porch, stoop, 
gallery, colonnade, arcade, terrace, balcony, marquee, canopy, or 
awning. 

  Massing 1. Symmetrical in form. 
2. The appearance of a balanced design increases the level of 

formality, and shall be encouraged. 
3. Massing, while often larger as a whole, should be divided into 

visually distinct sections.  
4. Massing divisions should provide visual order to the building and 

create vertical proportions within individual elements. 
5. On corner lots Landmark Buildings shall be designed with two 

façades of equal, though not identical architectural quality. 
6. Landmark Buildings located in a civic space shall be designed with 

four façades of equal, though not identical architectural quality. 

Scale: 

  Size In order to be more visually prominent across greater distances, the 
scale of the building should be larger than that of nearby buildings. 

  Building height 3 stories max. 48 ft. above grade, max. (excluding appurtenances).  

  Story height Floor-to-ceiling heights and architectural details should be 
proportionately larger than those of nearby private buildings. 



Thomasville Municipal Code 

Last amended 6-21-17 

Page 119 of 137 
 

  Roof Appurtenances Spires, steeples, towers, cupolas, and belfries can visually extend the 
height of the building, and shall be incorporated when practicable. 
 

Materials: 

  Buildings shall use durable, high quality materials that convey a sense of permanence. These include, but are not 
limited to brick, stone, and cast concrete. Wood construction is appropriate, but should only be executed with the 
highest quality framing and cladding materials. Generally, stucco should be avoided as a material that lacks scale 
and texture. If used, stucco should be traditional, have integral pigment, and be scored to define human-scaled 
dimensions on the façade. 

Specific to Churches and Places of Worship 

  In addition to the above standards, Churches and Places of Worship shall:  
1. Traditional Design. A church should be easily identifiable with timeless features such as bell towers, steeples, 

clearstory windows, and stained glass integrated into the design. Traditionally designed buildings can be 
navigated easily based on intuition without much signage. For example, if a sign or large symbol (e.g. cross) is 
needed to identify the sanctuary then the design can be improved. 

2. Vertical Massing. The scale of the sanctuary building should not overwhelm the block. Building features such as 
arches, columns, pilasters, rooflines (including dormers), and masonry patterns shall divide and create a vertical 
orientation on larger surfaces. Once these proportions have been established, windows (including clearstory) 
and doors shall reinforce the vertical orientation of the composition. 

3. Be Transparent. Being able to see and hear a little bit of what's going on inside makes a church seem less 
intimidating and peeks the interest of those passing by. This is the same principal as “window-shopping,” only 
adapted to a church. It is not uncommon for people to join a service after hearing music wafting through the 
doors of a church. 

4. Define Entrances. The church’s buildings should be open and inviting, with a clear sense of where to enter. In no 
case shall a church’s side doors function as a primary entry point. 

5. Entrances Close to Pedestrians. Use frontage elements such as porches, stoops, galleries, arcades, and canopies 
to bring the church up to the street or public space, while still providing an area for people to gather.  

6. Doors. Church doors should be prominent and inviting. 
7. Parking. Parking lots disrupt the neighborhood fabric and discourage members from walking to and from church, 

resulting in less patronage of local shops and cafes. Parking should be on-street, or shared with other 
commercial or institutional buildings in the vicinity. 

8. Create a Community Focal Point. Add neighborhood- friendly features such as athletic fields, tennis or basketball 
courts, a playground, an outdoor amphitheater, etc. 

9. Permeable Campus. Churches that span more than one block shall ensure that their campus is permeable, 
allowing people to walk through the property using multiple routes. 

Use: 

  This building type / lot may only house Churches or Other Place of Worship; Public Owned Recreation Centers, 
YMCA’s and Institutions of a Similar Nature; Schools (Public or Private); Business Schools; Clubs or Lodges (Private); 
Colleges or Universities; Cultural Facilities; Railroad or Bus Passenger Stations; and Municipal Structures as defined 
in Section 508 (Uses).

Section 22-503:  Frontages and Building Elements 

Porches and Stoops 

Porches and stoops provide outdoor living space. Often, they provide 
protection from the sun, while still permitting breezes to infiltrate the 
body of the building. They provide architectural interest and delineate 
the building’s entrance. This type is appropriate for residential building 
types with small setbacks. Typically, the porch or stoop is located in the 
build-to-zone as close to the sidewalk as possible. It is elevated to 
ensure privacy within the building from those passing by. Stairs may 
lead directly to the sidewalk or may be side-loaded.  

 

Depth 
  Porch  = 8 ft. min.;  
  Stoop = 4 ft. min.; 8 ft. max. 

 

Length 
  Porch = 25% to 100% of building front; 10 ft. min. 
  Stoop = 5 ft. min.; 8 ft. max.  

Height, Clear = 8 ft. min. 

Height = 2 stories max. 
Porches and stoops may have multi-story verandas and / or balconies above.  

Finish Level Above Grade = 2 ft. min.; 5 ft. max. (no more than 8” below the first interior finished floor level). 

Porches and stoops may occur forward of the build-to line, but shall not extend into the right-of-way. They may extend 
into the ROW upon the approval of an easement by the Architectural Review / Zoning Appeals Board.  

Stairs may extend forward of the build-to line into the right-of-way, or upon a utility easement if constructed of non-
masonry, breakaway materials. Full sidewalk clearance shall be maintained.        

Porches and stoops are un-airconditioned. Screens on front porches are prohibited.  

Galleries, Colonnades, Arcades, and Terraces 

This frontage is associated with commercial uses, and is permitted to 
encroach upon the setback, or even into the right of way over the 
sidewalk. The space allows one to window-shop or dine in a shaded 
environment that also captures breezes. The frontage provides 
architectural interest and delineates the building’s entrance. Upper 
stories may be enclosed, providing livable bonus space for occupants. 

 

Depth  
  Gallery = 8 ft. min. from front wall of bldg. to the inside column face. 
  Colonnade / Arcade = 10 ft. min. from front wall of the building to 
    the inside column face. 

 

Length = 75% to 100% of building front. On corners, may wrap around the side of the building facing the side street. 

Height, Clear = 10 ft. min. 

Height = 2 stories max. Additional stories may be permitted by the supervising planner.   
Colonnades and Arcades have 2 or more stories, with upper stories enclosed as habitable space. 

Finish Level Above Grade = 0” – 6” max. 

Galleries, Colonnades, Arcades, and Terraces may occur forward of the build-to line, but may only extend into the right-
of-way (to within 2 ft. of curb) upon the approval of an easement by the Arch. Rev. / Zoning Appeals Board.

In order to address changes in grade, and upon approval of the Supervisory Planner, a Terrace may be utilized in lieu 
of a Gallery at a min. depth = 10 ft., min. length = 75% to 100% of the bldg. front (may wrap bldg. on street side).      

Balconies 

A balcony is connected to a building’s upper stories and is supported by 
either a cantilever or by columns on one side. This type is appropriate 
for residential and commercial buildings with small setbacks. Typically, 
the balcony is located forward of the build-to-zone over the sidewalk. It 
allows occupants of the building to experience the activities of the 
street while also providing significant privacy from those passing by.  

 

Depth 
  2nd Story  = 5 ft. min. 
  Upper Story = 3 ft. min. 

 

Length = 25% to 100% of building front; 5 ft. min.   

Height, Clear =  
  1st floor residential = 9 ft. min. 
  1st floor non-residential = 10 ft. min.; 8 ft. min with suspended signage. Supporting brackets are exempt.  

Balconies shall occur forward of the build-to line and may encroach over the right-of-way to within 2 ft. of the curb. 

Balconies shall be made of wood or metal and may have roofs, but are required to be open, un-airconditioned spaces. 
Balconies in the rear of the building may have screens. 

Ideally, balconies should be supported from below by visible brackets, scaled as if they are supporting the weight of the 
mass, or from above by suspension cables or chains. 

On corners, balconies may wrap around the side of the building facing the side street.  

Marquees, Canopies, and Awnings 

A permanently roofed architectural projection whose sides are either 
vertical or horizontal and are supported entirely from an exterior wall 
of a building. This frontage is typically used for the display of signs. 
Horizontal marquees, canopies, and awnings provide shade from the 
sun, as well as enhanced weather protection for both the building and 
the passerby.  

 

Depth = 5 ft. min.  

Length = 25% to 100% of building front.  

Height, Clear = 8 ft. min. (including suspended signage).  

The above requirements apply to the 1st floor only. There are no dimensional requirements for marquees, canopies, and 
awnings above the 1st floor.  

Sign copy on marquees, canopies, and awnings on 2nd story windows is not permitted. 

Marquees, canopies, and awnings shall occur forward of the build-to line and may encroach over the right-of-way to within 
2 ft. of the curb. 

Marquees and canopies must be visually supported from below by brackets, or from above by suspension cables or ns. 

The top of each awning shall be at the same height as the top of each opening below. 

Awnings shall be made of fabric. Vinyl and high-gloss or plasticized fabrics are prohibited. 

Backlit awnings are prohibited.

Drive-Through Facilities 

Retail, Restaurant, and Service uses with a drive-through 
facility shall comply with the following standards: 

1. Building Location and Circulation. The dimensional and 
design standards established in this overlay code for 
building types and parking shall apply. In no case shall a 
vehicular access way / driveway or off-street parking area 
be permitted between the front façade of the building 
and the frontage street; or in the case of a corner lot, 
between the side façade of the building and the side 
street. Exception: buildings with a footprint in excess of 
35,000 sf. that comprise a multi-building or campus 
development (See Section 22-502 (k)).       

2. Access. Drive-through access may only occur from the 
front if there is no adjacent side street or alleyway. 

3. Configuration. Drive-throughs shall be located to the side 
or at the rear of the building and shall be designed so that 
pedestrian safety is ensured.  

4. Corner Lot. Drive-throughs serving a building located on a 
corner lot shall be located to the rear or interior side. In 
no case shall the drive-through be located on the side of a 
building facing a street. 

5. Types. Both remote drive-through technology (in which 
objects are placed in a capsule and delivered to the drive-
through via a tube) and attached drive-throughs are 
permitted. 

6. Roof. If covered, the roof over the drive-through shall be 
of a complementary architectural design as the design 
covering the primary portion of the structure. The roof on 
a multi-lane attached drive-through that is visible from 
the street may be designed as a porte corchere. 

7. Talk Boxes. Talk boxes at drive-through facilities shall be 
screened by a sound barrier such as landscaping, a fence 
or a masonry wall.

Section 22-504:  Architecture  

Description: 

  General 
Within the overlay district, commercial, multi-family, and residential buildings should reflect a combination of 
vernacular and more formal architecture. This includes residential building types that are utilized for either 
residential or commercial purposes, and commercial building types that are used for a mix of non-residential 
purposes. Essential characteristics include: 
1. Raised or at-grade foundations. 
2. A clearly discernable base (e.g. foundation / water table), middle, and top (e.g. roof) on each building. 
3. The use of permanent and durable materials. 
4. Buildings are typically simple combinations of one or more rectangular forms. 
5. Simple, 2 to 2.5 story massing, with predominantly gabled or hipped roof forms, and some parapeted roofs. 
6. Both enclosed eaves with simplified classical detailing and exposed rafter ends. 
7. Porches with simplified classical detailing. 
8. Mixed architectural vocabulary, utilizing wood, stucco, and masonry. 
Residential Buildings 
Residential structures find precedent in the vernacular one and one-half-story cottages, two-story houses with 
porches, and larger estates of downtown Thomasville. 
Multi-family Buildings 
Multi-family buildings find precedent in the mansion apartment houses and rowhouses of downtown Thomasville 
and are configured to resemble a large single-family house, or row of three or more attached townhouses. 
Commercial Buildings 
Commercial buildings are typically commercial in character, appearing as detached, single-use structures with 
parapetted or gabled, pedimented roof forms, and formal shopfronts or workshops. 
Mixed-use Buildings 
Mixed-use structures are modest in scale, and appear as detached, multi-story commercial buildings. 

Massing: 

  General 
1. Buildings shall incorporate variations in wall heights, façade articulations, and varied roof planes and pitches. 
2. Wall planes shall be divided into visually distinct sections that provide visual order and create vertical proportions 

by the arrangement of windows and features such as columns, pilasters, canopies, and clearly-articulated 
entrances. 

3. The main entrance to a building shall be clearly identifiable and shall be oriented to face a public street or space 
with direct sidewalk access. Entrances shall incorporate design features such as canopies, porticos, arcades, raised 
cornice parapets or peaked roof forms over the doorways, arches, and display windows. 

4. Buildings in the overlay district shall be articulated and finished on all sides. Sides of commercial or mixed-use 
buildings that do not face (or will not likely face) a residential building or public street or space are exempt.   

  Roofs 
1. Roofs are typically gabled, or hipped, with some flat.  
2. Half stories are typically articulated utilizing gable ends and dormers. 
3. Commercial and multi-family buildings shall have relatively steep slopes, ranging from 8 in 12 to 10 in 12. Larger 

commercial buildings may have slopes from 4 in 12 to 8 in 12 or have flat roofs. 
4. Porch roofs may have a lower pitch with a minimum slope of 3 in 12. 
5. Roof penetrations and equipment (except chimneys) shall be screened by parapet, located on the rear slope, or 

otherwise configured to have as minimal visual impact as practicable from the public street or space. 
6. Shed (monopitch) roofs shall only be attached to the principal building walls, with a minimum slope of 2 in 12. 
7. Applied Mansard roofs shall not be permitted. 
8. Architectural (cupolas, towers, steeples, chimneys, etc.) and mechanical (heat and air, elevator enclosure, etc.) 

appurtenances may exceed the allowable building height as follows: 
          Roof Area (combined) = 25% max.; Height = 18’ max.

 PARKING LOCATION AND DESIGN 
1. Wherever possible parking shall be placed along streets 

and in small, strategically located on-site lots (see diagram 
at left). 

2. Parking lots shall be located behind buildings, such that 
buildings separate parking areas from the street. 

3. In cases where this is not possible, and upon approval of 
the Zoning Administrator, parking may be located to the 
side of a building. In no case shall the side parking area be 
wider than fifty (50) percent of the lot frontage. 

4. In no case shall parking be located between the front 
façade of the building and the frontage street; or in the 
case of a corner lot, between the side façade of the 
building and a side street. 

5. Parking lots shall be setback as depicted at left. 
6. Perimeter parking lot landscaping is required as depicted at 

left, and described below (On-site Parking Lot Landscaping).   
7. On-street parking shall be encouraged as a means of 

promoting safety by calming traffic and separating moving 
vehicles from pedestrians using the sidewalk.  

 ACCESS TO OFF-STREET PARKING 
1. Buildings that have both rear and side access shall access 

parking through the rear (see diagram at left). 
2. Front driveways to rear parking areas are permitted only 

where rear or side street access is unavailable (see

4. The minimum effective curb radius shall be utilized. 
5. Ribbon driveways with permeable center strips shall be 

encouraged for single and two-family residential lots.   
6. Circular drives shall be permitted on a case by case basis by 

the Zoning Administrator where necessary for drop-off and 
pick-up only (day care, church, etc.). 

 LINKAGES BETWEEN OFF-STREET PARKING 
1. Linkages between parking areas within the perimeter of 

the block (and half block) should be encouraged when a 
rear alley or lane is present, and shall be provided when 
there is no rear alley or lane present (see diagram at left). 

2. In no case shall a vehicular accessway / driveway be 
permitted between the front façade of the building and 
the frontage street; or in the case of a corner lot, between 
the side façade of the building and the side street.

   RESIDENTIAL GARAGES 
1. Garage door(s) shall be positioned on the back half of the 

lot and no closer than twenty (20) feet behind the 
principal plane of the building front (see diagrams at left).  

2. If possible, garage doors shall face the side or rear of the 
lot, not the frontage street. 

 

 ON-SITE PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING  
1. A 36-42” fence, wall, or hedge with a min. opacity of 75% 

shall be provided wherever a perimeter landscape strip 
abuts a street or first floor residential use. Single-family 
and two-family (duplex) lots shall be exempt. 

2. Landscape islands are required in parking areas at the 
following intervals for head-in or diagonal parking stalls: 

 No more than eight (8) consecutive parking stalls are 
permitted without a landscape break of at least six (6) 
feet in width and extending the entire length of the 
parking stall.  

 Each landscape break shall have at least one (1) 
overstory shade tree for every one-hundred eighty 
(180) square feet of area, or portion thereof, and be 
covered with grass, shrubs, or living ground cover. 

 To minimize water consumption, the use of low-water 
vegetative ground cover other than turf is encouraged. 

3. In lieu of landscaped islands, landscape strips, of at least 
six (6) feet in width, can be provided between parking 
isles. Landscape strips shall have the same landscape 
requirements as landscape islands. 

 

 NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED 
1. The number of parking spaces provided shall be based on 

use as provided at left. 
2. On-street parking provided adjacent to the site may count 

as part of the required parking supply, provided the 
design is deemed acceptable by the Zoning Administrator. 

3. Off-site parking that is located off-street and within 500 
ft. of the site may count as part of the required parking 
supply for non-residential uses, provided the design is 
deemed acceptable by the Zoning Administrator. 

4. For two uses, shared parking shall be calculated as 
follows. The sum of the required parking for the two uses 
shall be divided by the factor listed in the table at left. The 
required number of parking spaces shall be rounded up to 
the closest whole number. 

5. When three or more uses share parking or a use is not 
listed, the amount of required parking may be reduced if 
the Zoning Administrator determines that the uses: 

 Seek to share parking with distinct and differing peak 
parking usage periods (e.g., bank and theater); or 

 The special nature of a certain development (e.g., 
housing inhabited by persons with low or no 
automobile ownership) does not require the amount 
of parking listed. 

The reduction shall be based on a parking demand study.
