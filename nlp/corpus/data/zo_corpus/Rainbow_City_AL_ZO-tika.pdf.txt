zones or districts and may also adopt such ordinances as necessary to carry into effect and 
make effective the provisions of this ordinance. 

 
(b) The City Council may divide the City into districts of such number, shape, and area as may 

be deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, and within such districts, it 
may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use 
of buildings, structures, or land.  All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind 
of buildings throughout each district, but the regulations in any one district may differ from

of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, this ordinance in its entirety and remaining parts 
thereof, other than the part so held to be invalid, shall still be valid.

These regulations shall not be construed as abating any existing or pending action; or as 
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue; or as 
affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation; or as waiving any right of the City 
under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations; or as 
vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation by lawful 
action of the City, except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.

ARTICLE II.  ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
 

DIVISION 1. GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 20.  Zoning Districts. 
 

The City Council hereby divides the City of Rainbow City into zoning districts, which shall 
be known by the designations and titles which follow: 

 
(1) Agricultural districts. 

 
AG Agricultural District 

 
(2) Residential districts. 

 
R-1 Single Family Residential District 
R-2 Patio Home and Townhouse District 
R-3 Multi-Family Residential District 
MHP Manufactured Home Park District 

 
(3)  Business districts. 

 
NS Neighborhood Shopping District 
HC Highway Commercial District 

 
(4)  Industrial districts. 

 
M-1 Manufacturing District 

 
(5) Special purpose districts. 

 
PUD Planned Unit Development District 
FHZ Flood Hazard Zone District 
L General Purpose Liquor Sales District 

 
Sec. 21.  Zoning Map. 
 
(a) The zoning districts established by this ordinance are bounded and defined by an official 

zoning map which shall be known as the Rainbow City Zoning Map and which, together 
with all explanatory materials contained therein, is hereby made a part of this ordinance. 

 
(b) The official zoning map shall be drawn on durable transparent material from which prints 

can be made and shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator. 



 
 6 

(c) The Zoning Administrator shall update the official zoning map within ninety to one hundred 
twenty days after amendments to it are adopted by the City Council.  

 
(d) Should the official zoning map or any portion thereof be lost, destroyed, damaged, or 

difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of revisions, the Zoning Administrator 
shall have a new map drawn and adopted by resolution of the City Council.  The new map 
may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior map, but no such correction 
shall have the effect of amending the maps.  Any map amendment shall follow rezoning 
amendment procedures contained in this ordinance. 

 
Sec. 22.  Zoning District Boundaries. 
 

The rules of this section shall be used to determine the precise locations of any district 
boundary shown on the Rainbow City Zoning Map. 

 
(1) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following any jurisdictional limits 

shall be construed as following such limits. 
 

(2) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets, alleys, or rights-
of-way shall be construed as following such streets, alleys, or rights-of-way. 

 
(3) Boundary lines which follow or approximately follow platted lot lines or other 

property lines as shown on the Etowah County Tax Maps shall be construed as 
following such lines. 

 
(4) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be 

construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines. 
 

(5) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following shorelines of any lakes 
or ponds shall be construed to follow the mean high water lines of such lakes or 
ponds.  In the event of a change in the mean high waterline, the boundaries shall be 
construed as moving with the actual mean high waterline. 

 
(6) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerline of streams, 

rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following 
the channel of such water courses taken at mean low water.  In the event of a natural 
change in the location of such streams, rivers, or other water courses, the district 
boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. 

 
(7) Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any 

of the features listed in paragraphs (1) through (6) above shall be construed to be 
parallel to such features.  In the absence of specific dimensions, the scale of the map 
shall determine the distance from such features. 

 
 



 
 7 

Sec. 23.  District Use Regulations. 
 

Unless otherwise provided, no building, structure, or land shall be used except in the zoning 
districts indicated by this article and according to the regulations of this ordinance and other 
applicable codes and ordinances. 

 
Sec. 24.  Use Limitations Due to Zoning Standards.  
 

A use may be permitted only if it can meet all of the standards of this ordinance and other 
applicable codes and ordinances. 

 
Sec. 25.  Combined Principal and Accessory Uses. 
 
(a) Unless otherwise prevented by this ordinance, more than one permitted principal use may be 

combined on a lot if all of the combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally 
related to one another.  Further, all zoning regulations for each of the combined uses shall be 
met. 

 
(b) Whenever an activity, which may or may not be separately listed in the district, is conducted 

in conjunction with a permitted use in the district as an incidental or insubstantial part of the 
total activity on a lot, the incidental activity shall be permitted as an accessory use if the 
combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally related to one another. 

 
(c) For the purpose of this section, “commonly associated” means that the association of such 

combined uses takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common community 
acceptance of their relatedness. 

 
Sec. 26.  Interpretation of Uses. 
 

This ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings, given the infinite 
variations of essentially similar uses.  Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to 
make interpretations so as to classify any questioned use as falling within a listed use of 
similar impact and characteristics.  However, in no case shall the Zoning Administrator 
interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in question is more similar in impact 
and characteristics to another listed use.  Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's use 
interpretation may be filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

 
Sec. 27.  Unclassified Uses. 
 

In the event the Zoning Administrator finds a new or unusual use that cannot appropriately 
fit a listed use in any district, the following procedures shall be followed: 

 
(1) If compatible with the existing zoning district intent, the unclassified use shall be 

permitted by special exception upon approval of and subject to the conditions set by 
the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 



 
 8 

 
(2) If the unclassified use is not compatible with the intent of the existing zoning district, 

the Zoning Administrator shall determine the most appropriate district classification 
and require the property in question to be rezoned.  In addition, the unclassified use 
shall be permitted in the new district by special exception if granted approval by the 
Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

 
(3) Following the final action on the unclassified use, as (1) or (2) above may require, 

the Planning Commission shall initiate an amendment to this ordinance to list the 
newly permitted use into the most appropriate district(s). 

 
 
Sec. 28.  Minimum Standard for All Dwellings. 
 
(1) Minimum Dwelling Unit Gross Floor Area: 
             
            (a)  One thousand, two hundred and fifty square feet (1,250) in R-1 and one thousand square 

feet (1,000) in all other zoning districts that allow residential construction.  
 
(2) Minimum Exterior Width of Dwelling: 
 
            (a)  Twenty (20) feet. 
 
(3) Foundation/Slab Requirements: 
  
            (a)  All dwellings shall be placed or constructed on a poured concrete slab or foundation in 

compliance with all applicable building code requirements. 
 
Secs. 29-39. Reserved.

DIVISION 2. AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS 
 
Sec. 40.  AG Agricultural District. 
 
(a) AG District intent.  This district consists primarily of undeveloped lands where agricultural 

and related pursuits may occur within the City and where agricultural support centers may 
serve outlying rural areas beyond the City.  Further, the intent of the AG District is to hold 
these lands in agricultural, forest, outdoor recreational, rural residential, and other limited yet

development conflict with the subdivision regulations or any other requirements of this 
zoning ordinance, the standards approved in the MHP approval process shall control. 

 
(u)  MHP approval process.  Approval of a Manufactured Home Park requires a three step 

approval process, as follows: 
 

(1)  Rezoning and concept plan approval.  A concept plan shall accompany each 
application for rezoning to the MHP District.  Development of the Manufactured 
Home Park shall be in substantial accord with the approved concept plan.  The 
concept plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a professional 
engineer, land surveyor, architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the 
State of Alabama.  The concept plan shall show, in schematic detail, the concept for 
use and development of the entire MHP tract. 

 
 
 



 
 49 

(2)  Preliminary site plan approval. 
 

a.  Following rezoning and concept plan approval, the developer shall submit to 
the Planning Commission a preliminary site plan for each phase of the 
development. 

 
b.  The preliminary site plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared 

by a professional engineer, land surveyor, architect, or landscape architect 
licensed to practice in the State of Alabama. 

 
c.  The preliminary plan shall show information necessary for the Planning 

Commission to adequately assess the suitability of the proposed 
development, including at a minimum the following items: 

 
- the location of proposed uses;  
- proposed building areas and heights;  
- proposed residential development density and housing types;  
- lots with proposed sizes, widths, and yards;  
- proposed screening and buffer yards; 
- proposed off-street parking and loading areas;  
- layout of streets, pedestrian facilities, and drives;  
- location of all entrances to the tract; and  
- layout and configuration of common open space. 

 
d.  A narrative text and supplemental drawings shall accompany the preliminary 

site plan, describing the general design and construction policies for the 
Manufactured Home Park; the proposed design and construction standards 
for streets; the treatment of environmentally-sensitive land located in the 
project tract (areas of flooding, severe slope, woodlands, streams, lakes, and 
ponds); the proposed time frame for phased development; and such other 
conditions for use and development proposed by the applicant. 

 
e.  All preliminary site plans shall be in substantial accord with the approved 

concept plan.  Any deviation in the preliminary site plan from the approved 
concept plan shall require resubmitting of the MHP District rezoning and 
concept plan approval application. 

 



 
 50 

(3)  Final site plan approval.  Before each phase of the development is constructed, a 
final site plan shall be required, in accordance with § 314 Site Plan Review.  Final 
site plan approval shall be coordinated with the approval of subdivision plats and 
construction plans, as required by the Rainbow City Subdivision Regulations.  All 
final site plans shall be in substantial accord with the approved preliminary site plan. 

 
 
 Any deviation in the final site plan from the approved preliminary site plan shall 

require resubmitting of the preliminary site plan application. 
 
(v)  Issuance of permits within a MHP District subdivision.  Permits may be issued in any phase 

of a MHP development with public improvements under construction, following completion 
of final site plan and subdivision plat approval, provided: 

 
(1)  No building permits for a subdivision with public improvements under construction 

shall be issued unless the extent of street improvements is adequate for vehicular 
access by the prospective builder and by police and fire equipment.  Further, no 
building permit shall be issued for the greater of two or the final 10% of lots within 
the subdivision until all public improvements and dedications have been completed 
by the developer and accepted by the City. 

 
(2)  No certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior 

to the completion and dedication of required public improvements and posting of a 
maintenance bond for public improvements.

DIVISION 3. SUPPLEMENTAL DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 140.  Purpose of Supplemental Dimensional Regulations. 
 

This division assigns supplemental dimensional standards over and above those imposed by 
the district dimensional regulations.  Unique characteristics and conditions of development 
require these supplemental standards. 

 
Sec. 141.  Minimum Standards for Un-sewered Lots. 
 

Any lot not served by public water and sewer shall have a minimum lot area of 15,000 
square feet and a minimum lot width of 100 feet and meet the requirements of the "Rules of 
Onsite Sewage Disposal and Subdivision Onsite Sewage Systems", State Board of Health, 
July 20, 1988, as amended. The County Health Department may set a larger minimum lot 
area requirement to accommodate private wells or septic systems. Where the district 
dimensional regulations or the supplemental use regulations require a lot area greater than 
15,000 square feet, the more restrictive regulations shall apply. 

 
Sec. 142.  Minimum Yard Exceptions. 
 
(a) Projections into required yards. 
 

(1) Architectural features, chimneys, eaves, and the like may project up to two feet into 
any required yard, but no closer than three feet to any lot line. 

 
(2) Terraces, steps, uncovered porches, and similar features less than three feet above the 

floor level of the ground story may project into any required yard, but no closer than 
three feet to any lot line. 

 
(3) Covered entry porches, balconies, fire escapes and similar features may project up to 

four feet into any required yard. 
 
(b) Fences, walls, and hedges.  Fences, walls, and hedges that are substantially opaque may not 

exceed thirty inches in height within a required front yard, subject to the traffic visibility 
provisions of this article (§ 145). 

 
(c) Satellite dish antennas.  Satellite dish antennas and other ground mounted antennas shall not 

be permitted in the front yard.  Setbacks from all property lines shall be a distance equal to 
the height of the antenna.  The setback of a satellite dish antenna shall be the minimum 
distance measured from the closest edge of the dish to the property line.  Satellite dishes are 
subject to the district maximum building height limitations. 

 
 



 
 52 

(d) Elimination of non-residential yards.  For any non-residential buildings, the side or rear yard 
may be eliminated to accommodate attached buildings sharing a common party wall at the 
lot line, subject to meeting all building codes. 

 
(e) Side yard along street lines.  In the case of a corner lot, the side yard which extends along 

one of the street lines shall in no event be less than 15 feet, regardless of the district 
minimum or the yards set by supplemental use regulations (§§ 100-139). 

 
Sec. 143.  Maximum Building Height Exceptions. 
 
(a) The maximum building height limitations do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas 

(except satellite dishes), water tanks, ventilators, chimneys, or other appurtenances 
customarily placed above the roof and not intended for human occupancy.  

 
(b) Any principal building may be erected to a height in excess of the maximum building height 

for the district, provided each required yard is increased one foot for each one foot of excess 
height.   

 
Sec. 144.  Frontage Exceptions. 
 

All subdivided lots shall front on a public street, except within the following residential 
developments: 

 
(1) Lots of less than 7,000 square feet within a townhouse or patio or garden home 

subdivision.  All such lots may be served by private streets, constructed in 
accordance with the City Engineer's standards, and owned and maintained in 
common by a homeowners' association or equivalent legal entity. 

 
(2) Family subdivisions involving the conveyance of a one acre or larger lot from a five 

acre or larger parcel for the purpose of constructing a single family residence as the 
primary habitat of an immediate family member.  For the purpose of this provision, 
immediate family member shall include any naturally or legally-defined offspring.  
Such subdivision shall provide a 50 foot access easement from a public street to the 
lot. 

 
Sec. 145.  Traffic Visibility at Intersections. 
 
(a) On any corner lot, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow which would 

impede traffic visibility at intersections.  No obstruction shall be placed within a clear sight 
triangle between a height of two feet and seven feet above the centerline grades of the 
intersecting streets.  This clear sight area on the two lot lines forms a triangle.  The triangle is 
bounded by the two lot lines along the street, each measured twenty-five feet from their 
intersection; a straight line connects the legs of the triangle.  This shall be a twenty-five foot 
clear sight triangle. 

 



 
 53 

(b) When one or both of the intersecting streets is an arterial street, the clear sight triangle shall 
be 50 feet. 

 
(c) Where a private driveway intersects a public street, a clear sight triangle of 10 feet shall be 

maintained.  The legs of the triangle shall be measured from the intersection of the street line 
and the edge of the driveway. 

 
Sec. 146.  Dimensional Requirements for Accessory Buildings. 
 
(a) Non-residential accessory buildings. Non-residential accessory buildings up to 12 feet in 

height shall be permitted within 7.5 (seven & one-half) feet of any side or rear property  
            line but not occupy any portion of a front yard. 
 
(b) Residential accessory buildings.  Residential accessory buildings and attached and detached 

carports, garages, and boat houses on residential lots shall meet the following dimensional 
requirements: 

 
(1) In all zoning districts except Agricultural District, the maximum floor area shall be 

40% of the habitable floor area of the principal building. 
 

(2) The maximum height shall be in no case greater than the principal building height. 
 

(3) Such structures and additions shall be subject to the district front yard requirement. 
 

(4) Such structures shall be no closer than 7.5 feet to any property line. 
 
Sec. 147.  Dimensional Requirements for the Keeping of Chickens, Cows, Exotics, Horses, 
Oxen, and Sheep. 
 
(a) Definitions: 
 

enclosure.  An enclosed or fenced in area including, but not limited to, barns, stables,

(c) Parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a 

public street.  This requirement does not apply to parking areas that serve one or two 
dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets shall be prohibited. 

 
(d) All parking areas adjoining a public right-of-way shall be physically separated from the 

right-of-way. 
 
(e) All lighting fixtures used to illuminate parking areas shall not direct lights on adjoining 

streets or properties. 
 
(f) Parking areas for all developments shall be so designed so that sanitation, emergency, and 

other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing 
unreasonable distances or making other dangerous turning movements.  Fire lanes may be 
required by the fire code. 

 
(g) All parking areas in new construction and existing buildings if remodel and remodeling cost 

exceeds 50% of the value of the structure shall be surfaced with dust-free materials (asphalt

to the building housing the served use.  If the use is not housed within a building, 
satellite parking spaces shall be located within 400 feet of the lot.  A satellite parking 
exception requires satisfactory written legal documentation that the user of such 
satellite spaces has the right to such spaces. 

 
(3)  A joint parking area may contain required parking spaces for more than one use, 

provided the combined number of spaces complies with the required parking for all 
uses.  If, however, the combined uses wish to make use of the same spaces at 
different times, the same spaces may be credited to each separate use.  The applicant 
for a combined use facility must present satisfactory legal documentation of a 
combined parking agreement and, if sharing the same spaces, a time schedule for 
allocation of such spaces. 

 
Sec. 175.  Parking Prohibitions. 
 
(a) The keeping of an inoperative motor vehicle in a residential district shall be within a fully 

enclosed building or structure or be completely screened or shielded from public view. 
 
(b) No vehicle exceeding 7,500 pounds gross weight and no boats, trailers, recreational vehicles, 

campers, and similar equipment, regardless of weight, shall be kept within a residential 
district unless such vehicle is parked behind the front building line. 

 
Sec. 176.  Parking Inside Structures. 
 

Required parking spaces may be provided in parking garages, roof parking on buildings, 
parking within buildings, and underground parking.  Such parking spaces shall meet the 
parking space and aisle width requirements of this ordinance. 

 
 
 
 



 
 64 

Sec. 177.  Access Controls. 
 
(a) Access to streets within the City shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator.  The 

proposed location, width, drainage structure, traffic conditions, site distances, and surfacing 
shall be addressed in the request for approval. 

 
(b) Entrances shall be held to a minimum and be located at points affording maximum sight 

distances, minimum grades, and maximum separation.  Combined or shared driveways and 
entrances or marginal access streets may be required for highway service uses along major 
streets. 

 
(c) Entrances to detached residential lots shall not be less than ten feet nor more than twenty feet 

in width.  Entrances to all other developments shall be no more than thirty five feet, or 
eighteen feet per lane of travel, and no less than twenty four feet, or twelve feet per lane of 
travel, in width, measured at the right-of-way line.  The radius to increase the opening shall 
be not be less than fifteen feet but not more than twenty five feet.  A larger radius to 
accommodate truck traffic may be required. 

 
(d) The maximum number of entrances for each site shall be limited on the basis of street

 DIVISION 3. SCREENING AND BUFFER YARD REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 190.  Purpose of Screening and Buffer Yard Regulations. 
 

The intent of this division is to set minimum standards that reduce common conflicts 
associated with incompatible adjacent land uses and to protect natural boundaries.  These 
standards seek to promote visual harmony, reduce noise, divert emissions, restrict passage, 
and enhance the natural environment, thereby providing for a compatible mix of otherwise 
conflicting uses of adjacent properties.  

 
Sec. 191.  Administration. 
 
(a) These standards are intended to encourage, not hamper, innovation in landscape and 

architectural design and shall be administered flexibly so as to give reasonable consideration 
to this objective. 

 
(b) These standards shall apply to all developments subject to site plan review.  Where screening 

and buffer yards are required, the site plan shall explicitly describe proposed compliance 
with these standards. 

 
(c) Screening and buffer yard standards imposed by § 346 Conditional Rezoning shall take 

precedence over the provisions of this division. 
 
Sec. 192.  Screening and Buffer Yard Specifications. 
 
(a) Acceptable screening materials include any combination of solid fencing (weather-resistant 

wood, brick, or decorative masonry), evergreen shrubs, or earth berms of a specified height.  
Planting of evergreen trees may also be required.  Screening shall be continuously 
maintained, present an attractive exterior appearance, and in the case of fencing, be of 
durable construction. 

 
(b) The buffer yard shall be reserved solely for screening. No buildings or structures, except for 

necessary access driveways, shall be permitted. 
 
Sec. 193.  Required Screening and Buffer Yard. 
 
(a) Where a patio or garden home, townhouse, apartment, institutional, or office development 

adjoins a single family residential lot, such development shall require a minimum screening 
height of eight feet and a minimum buffer yard width of 25 feet along the adjoining property 
line. 

 
(b) Where a commercial or industrial development adjoins a single family residential lot, such 

development shall require a minimum screening height of eight feet and a minimum buffer 
yard width of 50 feet along the adjoining property line. 

 
 
 



 
 68 

Sec. 194.  Modification or Waiver of Screening and Buffer Yard. 
 

These screening and buffer yard standards shall be applied equally to all similarly-classified 
and situated properties but may be modified or waived by the Planning Commission in 
certain cases where a site is subject to any of the following circumstances: 

 
(1) Natural land characteristics would achieve the same intent of this division. 

 
(2) Innovative landscape or architectural design is employed to achieve an equivalent 

screening and buffer yard effect. 
 

(3) Impending development of adjacent property would make these standards 
unreasonable or impractical. 

 
(4) The adjacent property is physically separated by an arterial street right-of-way. 

 
Secs. 195-209.  Reserved. 



 
 69 

 DIVISION 4. SIGN REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 210.  Purpose of Sign Regulations. 
 

The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the construction, maintenance, and 
regulation of outdoor advertising within the City.  While Rainbow City acknowledges the 
legitimate public need for business visibility, local businesses must also recognize the 
legitimate public need for a beautiful and uncluttered community and the City’s legitimate 
need to ensure safe traffic circulation on City streets.  Local experience within Rainbow City, 
Gadsden, Atlanta, and Birmingham generally supports the contention that excessive, 
competing signage along public streets can create visual clutter, which makes it difficult for 
motorists to see traffic control and highway safety signs and to know where entrances to 
adjoining businesses are located.  The City also has determined that excessive, competing 
signage can divert motorist attention from the highway, which contributes to traffic 
accidents.  Therefore, Rainbow City has determined that it is desirable to prescribe the 
manner of sign construction and to compel the use of safe materials; limit the number, type, 
surface area, height, and location of signs; and require clean and sanitary maintenance of 
signs in order to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
 Further, these sign regulations are intended to lessen hazards to pedestrian and vehicular 
traffic; preserve property values; prevent unsightly and detrimental development which has a 
blighting influence upon the community; and, in general, preserve the character and aesthetic 
quality of the various zones within the city. 

 
Sec. 211.  Sign Terms Defined. 
 

The following sign terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings defined by this 
section.

(1) year of the date of adoption of these regulations. 

 
(b)  Alterations.  A nonconforming sign shall not be rebuilt, expanded, or altered in a way that 

would increase the degree of nonconformity as it existed at the time the grandfather status

(b)  Freestanding signs.  In zoning districts where freestanding signs are permitted, each lot of 

record may have not more than one (1) freestanding sign.  Freestanding signs shall be 
securely fastened to the ground or to some other metallic or concrete supportive structure so 
that there is no danger that either the sign or the supportive structure may be moved by the 
wind or other forces of nature and cause injury to persons or property.  The City Council 
may approve one (1) additional freestanding sign for any existing lot of record that is 
accessed by more than one collector or arterial street on opposing sides of the property.  
Furthermore, if a development is located on a corner lot that has at least 100 feet of frontage 
on each of the two intersecting public streets, then, the City Council may allow not more 
than one freestanding sign along each side of the development bordered by such streets.  
Freestanding signs shall be located as close a possible to the main traffic access to the 
property, but shall not be located closer than four (4) feet to the right-of-way of a public 
street.  In addition, no freestanding sign shall be located less than thirty (30) feet from 
another freestanding sign on the same side of the street.  All freestanding signs shall comply 
with the following dimensional requirements. 

 
(1)  Maximum sign area:   one (1) percent of the building’s floor area or eighty (80) 

square feet, whichever is larger, but not to exceed two hundred fifty (250) square 
feet.  However, the maximum sign area for a freestanding sign that will serve all 
businesses in a shopping plaza may be increased by an additional ten (10) square feet 
per business. 

(2)  Maximum sign height, including the supporting structure and sign face:   twenty-five 
(25) feet.  However, the City Council may increase the maximum height of a 

 



 
 79 

  freestanding sign to ensure sign visibility from an adjoining public street, where the 
elevation of the street exceeds the elevation of the property by more than five (5) feet 
at the point where the freestanding sign will be erected.  In no instance shall the 
increased height allow the top of the freestanding sign face or copy to extend more 
than twenty (20) feet above the nearest surface elevation of the paved street. 

 
(3)  Maximum sign face or copy height:   eight (8) feet. 

 
(c)  Hanging and projecting signs.  In zoning districts where hanging and/or projecting signs are 

allowed, each building may have not more than one (1) hanging or projecting sign per 
building wall that has a building entrance.  Hanging or projecting signs may extend into a 
public right-of-way, but shall not extend any closer than four (4) feet to the inside face of a 
street curb or the outer edge of the paved travel lane of a street, whichever is applicable.  
Hanging or projecting signs shall be located as close as possible to said building entrance in 
accordance with the following requirements: 

 
(1)  Maximum sign area:   twelve (12) square feet. 

 
(2)  Maximum sign face or copy height:   four (4) feet. 

 
(3)  Maximum sign face or copy width:   three (3) feet. 

 
(4)  Minimum elevation from the bottom of the sign face or copy (including all supporting 

frames or braces) to the finished ground level directly beneath the sign:   eight (8) 
feet. 

 
(d)  Wall signs.  In zoning districts where wall signs are allowed, no portion of a wall sign shall 

extend above the building roof line or beyond the edges of the wall.  In addition, no portion 
of a wall sign shall obscure any portion of a window or entranceway to the building.  Each 
wall sign shall be affixed flush to the wall, and shall not project more than four (4) inches 
away from the wall surface, exclusive of any approved lighting fixtures.  The following 
dimensional requirements also shall apply to all permitted wall signs: 

                                                                     
(1)  Maximum sign area of any individual wall sign:   7.5% for square footage of the wall 

where the sign is to be located or twenty-four (24) square feet, whichever is larger, 
but not to exceed two hundred fifty (250) square feet. 

 
(2)  Maximum sign face or copy height:   four (4) feet. 



 
 80 

Sec. 218.  Signs Allowed Within Residential Zoning Districts. 
 

Within residential zoning districts (R-1, R-2, R-3, and MHP) the only signs that shall be 
allowed are those classified as exempt from these regulations under § 213 and residential 
subdivision entrance signs in accordance with the following requirements: 

 
(1) Permanent freestanding ground signs to residential subdivision developments may be 

erected at principal entrances to the project.  One sign shall be permitted at each 
principal entrance to the development. 

 
(2) Entrance signs shall not exceed twenty (20) square feet in sign area and five (5) feet 

in height as measured from the base of the sign. 
 

(3) Entrance signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other substantial 
supportive structure so that there is no danger that either the sign or the supportive 
structure may be accidentally toppled or moved by the wind or other forces of nature 
and cause injury to persons or property. 

 
(4)  Residential subdivision entrance signs shall not be illuminated, unless indirect 

illumination is afforded by a street light positioned at the entranceway. 
 

(5)  Development entranceways, and, specifically, the area adjoining the entrance sign, 
should be appropriately landscaped and maintained to provide an attractive and 
inviting entrance to the subdivision. 

 
Sec. 219.  Signs Allowed Within Non-residential Zoning Districts. 
 

All signs that are exempt from these regulations shall be permitted in any non-residential 
zoning district in accordance with the conditions specified in § 213 of these regulations.  In 
addition, owners of land within a non-residential zoning district may erect any sign identified 
in § 217 of these regulations in accordance with all dimensional requirements prescribed 
therein.  However, in no instance shall the cumulative total sign area for all signs permitted 
under § 217 that are erected on a single lot of record exceed the limits specified below for the 
applicable non-residential zoning district.  Where a lot of record is divided by two or more 
non-residential zoning districts, the cumulative total sign area limitation of the more 
restrictive zoning district shall apply to the entire non-residentially zoned area of the subject 
lot of record. 

 
(1)  AG - Agricultural District.  Sixty (60) square feet of cumulative total sign area. 

 
(2)  NS - Neighborhood Shopping District.  Three hundred (300) square feet of 

cumulative total sign area. 
 

 



 
 81 

(3)  HC - Highway Commercial District.  Three hundred (300) square feet of cumulative 
total sign area, (exception:  May be increased for shopping centers.) 

 
(4)  M-1 - Manufacturing District.  Two hundred (200) square feet of cumulative total 

sign area. 
 

(5)  PUD - Planned Unit Development District.  Seventy-two (72) square feet of 
cumulative total sign area. 

 
(6)  FHZ - Flood Hazard Zone & L - General Liquor Sales District.  The total permitted 

cumulative sign area allowed shall be determined by the underlying zoning district 
requirements. 

 
Sec. 220.  Traffic Visibility Provisions. 
 

No permanent or temporary sign exceeding four square feet in area shall be permitted within 
the clear sight triangle of an intersection, as defined in § 146 Traffic Visibility at 
Intersections, or within fifteen feet from the front lot line.  This limitation may be waived if 
such sign does not obstruct visibility between a height of 30 inches and eight feet above the 
nearest street grade level or otherwise does not interfere with traffic visibility for entrance 
onto and exit from the lot and adjacent lots and the visibility of traffic flow through nearby 
intersections, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.  In any event, no sign, regardless 
of size, height, or design shall extend into any right-of-way, except as expressly authorized.  

 
Sec. 221.  Construction and Maintenance of Signs. 
 
(a)  All signs shall conform with city building codes, which provide a comprehensive set of 

construction standards for signs.  These specifications include wind loads, vibration 
resistance, seismic loads, acceptable supports, allowable stresses, materials, and electrical 
wiring. 

 
(b)  All signs and all components thereof, including structural supports, shall be kept in a state of 

good repair. 
 
(c)  The area surrounding the base of any freestanding sign shall be kept clear of all debris and 

undergrowth. 
 
(d)  No person may, for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of any sign, damage, 

trim, destroy, or remove any trees, shrubs, or other vegetation within any right-of-way 
(unless express written authorization is obtained from the agency having jurisdiction over the 
right-of-way) or on any area where landscaping is required by this chapter.

DIVISION 5. TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS, ANTENNAS, AND SATELLITE DISHES 
 
Sec. 230.   Purpose of  Regulations. 
 

The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the placement and appearance of 
telecommunication towers, antennas, and satellite dishes under the Telecommunications Act 
of 1996, where such control does not conflict with or unreasonably constrain the legitimate 
right of businesses to exercise free trade.  Rainbow City desires access to advanced 
technology to serve its businesses and citizens, but not at the expense of the community’s 
overall appearance and public image.  Rainbow City seeks to impose sensible controls on 
telecommunication facilities, in order to maintain the aesthetic character and charm of the 
community and its neighborhoods against the insensitive and uncontrolled proliferation and 
placement of wireless facilities.  New telecommunications towers should not create a 
cluttered landscape or dominate the community’s skyline as it is viewed from the primary 
highway entrances to Rainbow City.  To that end, the City desires to partner with 
telecommunications firms to ensure expansion of the existing telecommunications 
infrastructure that will provide effective advanced communications services throughout the 
City and surrounding environs, commensurate with local needs, with a minimal visual 
impact on the character and charm of the community, and without creating impediments to 
free competition among wireless telecommunications providers seeking to serve the City.  
These regulations have been developed by the City to achieve the aforementioned objectives. 

 
Sec. 231.   Definitions. 
 

The following sign terms, when used in this Ordinance, shall have the meanings defined by 
this section. 

 
(a) Antenna.  An electromagnetic device which conducts radio signals, through an 

attached cable or wave guide, to or from a radio transmitter or receiver.  “Antenna” 
includes devices commonly known as “whips,” “panels,” and “parabolic dishes.”  
“Antenna” shall include an antenna used in conjunction with microwave, cellular, or 
personal communication service systems and any other type of telecommunications 
systems now or hereafter in use. 

 
(b) Applicant.  A party or parties who apply for a permit to construct a tower, to 

install an antenna on a proposed or existing tower, or to locate equipment on a 
proposed or existing tower compound. 

 
(c) Co-Location Site.  A parcel of land or other site on which the antennas and 

related equipment of more than one party are located. 
 

(d) Communication Facilities.  Towers, antennas, and associated equipment 
collectively. 



 
 83 

(e) Equipment.  All equipment and facilities used in conjunction with one (1) or more 
towers and/or antennas, including, but not limited to, electronic systems, generators, 
fuel tanks, and fuel. 

 
(f) FAA.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. 

 
(g) FCC.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission. 

 
(h) Fiber-Optics.  Light transmissions through very fine flexible glass, by internal 

reflection. 
 

(i) Monopole.  Any self-supporting wooden pole, metal, or concrete pole designed to 
support an antenna; provided, that the word “monopole” shall not include a latticed 
steel or metal tower, a tower which requires guy wires for support, or a tower which 
has more than one (1) source of support, such as a tower with more than one (1) leg. 

 
(j) Residential Property.  Any land which is located in a Residential Zoning 

District--R-1, R-2, R-3, or MHP. 
 

(k) Surveyor.  A person who is registered with, and licensed by, the State of Alabama 
as a surveyor. 

 
(l) Tower.  Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of 

supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy 
towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission 
towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, 
alternative tower structures, and any other like structure used to support wireless 
telecommunications transmission facilities now or hereafter in use.  As used in this 
Section, “tower” shall include any telecommunication tower installed or constructed 
within the City prior to the effective date of this ordinance, regardless of whether 
such tower is a monopole or another type of tower. 

 
(m) Tower Compound.  A parcel of land or a building on which communication 

facilities are located. 
 

 



 
 84 

Sec. 232.   Jurisdiction of Regulations. 
 

All communication facilities or structures greater than one (1) meter in size, including but 
not limited to those facilities known as “cellular”, “personal communication system (PCS)”, 
“paging services”, and similar services, shall comply with these regulations.  However, the 
following shall be exempt from these regulations under the specified conditions: 

 
(a) Public Property.  Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or 

otherwise controlled by the City of Rainbow City, provided a license or lease 
authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the City Council. 

 
(b) Amateur Radio or Receive-Only Antennas.  Any tower, or the installation of any 

antenna that does not exceed the maximum height restriction of the applicable zoning 
district or seventy (70) feet–whichever is less–and is owned and operated by a 
federally-licensed amateur radio station operator, or is exclusively for receive-only 
antennas. 

 
(c) Pre-Existing Communication Facilities or Towers.  Any communication tower or 

antenna which was constructed prior to the effective date of these regulations and 
which complied with all applicable State, Federal, and Local codes, laws, and 
regulations in effect at the time of construction, provided, however, that all pre-
existing communication facilities or towers shall submit a written request of 
exemption to the Enforcement Officer within six (6) months of the effective date of 
these regulations.  The written request shall state the name, mailing address, business 
and home telephone numbers of the owner, the street address and tax parcel 
identification number of the property upon which the communication facilities are 
located, and the date upon which construction of the facilities was complete.  All 
written requests containing the required information shall be automatically approved 
if received within the above specified deadline. 

 
Sec. 233.   Basic Requirements and Design Considerations. 
 

All proposed communication facilities (towers and antennas) governed by these regulations 
shall comply with the following requirements and guidelines. 

 
(a) Compliance with FAA Regulations.  All proposed communication facilities shall 

comply with all applicable FAA requirements, including but not limited to, Part 77 of 
the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), as amended. 

 
(b) Compliance with FCC Regulations.  All proposed communication facilities shall 

comply with all applicable FCC requirements, including but not limited to, the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended. 

 
 



 
 85 

(c) Structural Safety.  All proposed communication facilities shall comply with wind 
loading and other applicable structural standards contained in local building and 
technical codes, as they may be in effect and amended from time to time, including, 
without limitation, the Southern Standard Building Code and the Electronic 
Industries Association Code and any amendments thereto or replacements thereof, as 
may be adopted by the City Council.  The City’s Building Inspector or his/her 
designee shall determine whether a proposed communication facility will comply 
with this requirement. 

 
(d) Appearance and View Protection.  All proposed communication facilities with the 

exception of proposed antennas that will be co-located on a pre-existing tower shall 
be attractively camouflaged, disguised, or hidden in a manner that it will blend into 
the surrounding environment to the greatest extent possible.  Examples of proper 
camouflaging include: designing a tower to resemble a tree, designing a monopole to 
look like and function as a flag pole or freestanding sign support, hiding an antenna 
within a church steeple, or any other effective means of disguising the appearance of 
a tower or antenna that may be appropriate for the setting in the area surrounding the 
proposed communication facility site.  It shall be the burden of the applicant to 
document and prove that a proposed communication facility cannot be effectively 
camouflaged, before approval of a non-camouflaged structure may be permitted by 
the City.  In such instances, the applicant shall explore alternative means of 
minimizing the visual impact of the antenna, such as installing it onto an existing 
telephone pole, streetlight, or building rooftop, rather than erecting a new tower 
specifically for the proposed antenna.  However, in no instance shall a non-
camouflaged communication facility be approved for a residential property. 

 
(e) Signs prohibited.  No signs or other forms of advertising, including signs displaying 

the name of the owner or user of the tower or antenna, may be attached to or depicted 
on a communication facility, unless the proposed facility is a new monopole 
specifically camouflaged and approved to serve as a permitted freestanding sign 
support.  This prohibition shall not apply to any required warning or private property 
posting signs. 

 
(f) Construction materials.  Where applicable building codes, technical codes, and 

federal regulations permit flexibility in the choice of construction materials and 
where the selection of alternative construction materials will not compromise the 
structural integrity of the proposed communication facility, proposed new towers and 
monopoles shall be constructed of materials that have a composition, texture, and 
color that will most closely resemble structures and natural features that exist on and 
adjoining the facility site. 

 
(g) Health Effects.  All proposed communication facilities shall comply with all 

applicable FCC regulations and requirements in effect to prevent detrimental health 
 



 
 86 

  effects from the proposed communication facilities.  Under the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996, the City cannot deny a request to construct a communication facility on 
the grounds that its radio frequency or electromagnetic emissions would be harmful 
to the environment or the health of residents, if those emissions meet FCC standards. 

 
(h) Interference with Existing Communication Facilities.  All proposed communication 

facilities shall comply with all applicable FCC regulations and requirements in effect 
to prevent interference with existing communication facilities serving the area. 

 
(i) Siting Requirements for Whip Antennas.  Whip antennas shall not be allowed on a 

wall mounted antenna structure. 
 

(j) Co-location.  No new tower or monopole shall be erected on a proposed 
communication facility site unless the applicant can document and prove that an 
existing co-location site is not available or is not technically capable of serving the 
specific telecommunication need in the area of the proposed site.  This co-location 
requirement may be waived by the City where the proposed antenna would create an 
excessively cluttered appearance on the available co-location site (thereby drawing 
greater visual attention to the existing antenna site or creating a more imposing 
obstruction to scenic views and vistas from the area) and the proposed new antenna 
would be less visible or intrusive on the surrounding area if effectively camouflaged 
on an alternate site. 

 
(k) Setback Requirements.  All proposed communication facilities and structures, 

including guys and accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum setback 
requirements of the zoning district in which they will be sited.  However, all 
proposed tower compounds that will be located on a residential property shall be 
subject to an additional setback from all property boundaries of the site equal to the 
height of the tower structure as measured from the finished ground level at the base 
or pad surface to the tallest point of the structure.  If the tower compound abuts a 
property with an existing or approved (but not yet constructed or completed) 
residential use, the residential property setback requirement shall be satisfied for all 
property boundaries of the site that abut said existing or approved residential uses. 

 
(l) Lighting.  Towers may not be artificially lighted, except where required to satisfy 

applicable FAA regulations.  Lights for security and to assist in making emergency 
repairs may be installed on buildings within the tower compound which contain 
equipment essential to the operation and maintenance of the tower.  Such lights shall 
be shielded and directed in a downward direction from a height of not more than ten 
(10) feet, and no such light may exceed a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) watts. 
 Such lights shall be located and directed so that they do not shine, reflect, or 
generate excessive glare onto or toward any residential property or adjoining 
property upon which a residential use exists or has been approved for construction. 



 
 87 

(m) Security Fence.  All communication facilities to be located within a proposed tower 
compound shall be secured by the construction of an eight (8) foot high security 
fence or wall constructed, at a minimum, using chain link fencing. 

 
(n) Landscaping.  All proposed tower compounds must be surrounded by a landscaped 

buffer which shall provide an effective year-round screen to a height of at least eight 
(8) feet upon planting in order to screen views of the tower compound from adjacent 
public ways, residential properties, and properties upon which a residential use exists 
or has been approved for construction.  The buffer shall include a landscaped strip at 
least four (4) feet in depth located outside of the security fence or wall.  The 
landscaped strip shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, vines, and 
grown covers which are capable of attaining, at maturity, a height as high as the 
security fence or wall and which will enhance and screen the outward appearance of 
the security fence.  The use of native species of plants and trees are encouraged to the 
extent that they will satisfy the requirement for adequate year-round screening.  The 
applicant shall provide documentation to show what forms of vegetation will be 
planted within the landscaped area and how the area will be effectively maintained to 
ensure the long-term health of the plantings. Such documentation shall include the 
name, mailing address, and business telephone number of the party who shall be 
responsible for the maintenance and repair of the communication facilities and any 
fences, walls, and landscaped buffer areas.  If the person or party responsible for 
such maintenance and repair changes any time after approval has been issued, the 
owner of the tower must provide the City’s Enforcement Officer with written notice 
of the new party’s name, mailing address, and business telephone number and the 
date upon which the change will become effective. 

 
(o) Communication Facility Siting Priorities.  When selecting sites within the City to 

locate proposed communication facilities or tower compounds, priority shall be given 
to locations in non-residential zoning districts.  Residential property sites shall be 
given the lowest possible consideration for new sites. 

 
(p) Access and Parking.  A driveway and parking area with a surface appropriate for the 

intensity of use shall be provided for each proposed tower compound to provide 
adequate access to the tower compound for the maintenance and repair of the 
communication facilities and for vehicle providing emergency services.  Subject to 
the approval of the City Council and to an appropriate agreement with the owner 
thereof, access and parking for the tower compound may be provided on an adjoining 
property or along one or more public streets adjoining the tower compound. 

 
Sec. 234.   Levels of Review and Approval. 
 

In recognition of the high standards for proposed communication facilities established by this 
Ordinance, allowances have been made for an efficient and, in certain instances, expedited 
 



 
 88 

review process, where the applicant can demonstrate that a good faith effort to embrace and 
comply with the spirit and intent of these guidelines has been made in the design of the 
proposal.  The three levels of review and approval and the types of projects that can be 
considered within each level are as follows: 

 
(a) Review and Approval by Enforcement Officer.  The following types of 

communication facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the Enforcement Officer 
without the need for a public hearing, provided the proposed improvements fully 
complies with all requirements specified in Section 233 of this Article: 

 
(1) Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be co-located on 

an existing approved or registered pre-existing tower, as long as the proposed 
antenna(s) will not protrude at any point from the exterior surface of said 
tower by a distance of more than four (4) feet and the tower will contain no 
more than five (5) antennas if the application is approved.  In addition, the 
supporting equipment for the proposed antenna(s) shall not require the 
construction of any new freestanding structures on the tower compound. 

 
(2) Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be sited in an 

existing structure that fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this 
Ordinance (not a non-conforming structure) and where, after installation, the 
antenna and all supporting equipment will be completely enclosed by the 
exterior walls of the structure or completely screened from public view at any 
point on the land within two (2) thousand feet of the proposed antenna.  An 
example of such a scenario would be the placement of an antenna within the 
steeple of a church or the dome of a farm silo.  The addition of the antenna 
and supporting equipment to the existing conforming structure shall not 
require the construction of an addition to house the communication facilities. 
 However, interior modifications to the structure may be permitted as part of 
the approval by the Enforcement Officer. 

 
(b) Review and Approval Exclusively by City Council.  The City Council shall have the 

authority to review and approve the following specific types of communication 
facilities and tower compounds, subject to the conduct of a public hearing, but 
without the need for a formal recommendation from the Planning Commission: 

 
(1) Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be installed on a 

co-location site that does not fall within the approval authority of the 
Enforcement Officer, as specified in Subparagraph (a) (1) of this Section. 

 
(2) Any new antenna (not including a tower) that will be attached to an existing 

structure that fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this 
Ordinance (not a non-conforming structure), but that would not otherwise fall  

 



 
 89 

 within the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer as specified in 
Subparagraph (a) (2) of this Section. 

 
(3) Any new monopole not greater than thirty (30) feet in height and located in a 

non-residential zoning district that is camouflaged or disguised in such a way 
that it cannot be immediately recognized as an antenna support. 

 
(4) Any new antenna or tower to be located on property owned, leased, or 

otherwise controlled by the City of Rainbow City and located within a non-
residential zoning district. 

 
(c) Review and Approval by City Council Upon Recommendation From Planning 

Commission.  All applications not subject to review and approval by the Enforcement 
Officer in accordance with Subparagraph (a) of this Section or review and approval 
exclusively by the City Council in accordance with Subparagraph (b) of this Section 
shall be subject to review and public hearings by both the Planning Commission and 
the City Council.  The Planning Commission shall review the application and issue a 
recommendation for approval or denial to the City Council.  Final review and 
approval or denial of the application shall be issued exclusively by the City Council. 

 
Sec. 235.   Approval Procedures. 
 

Review and approval of an application shall be conducted in accordance with the following 
procedures. 

 
(a) Pre-Application Consultation.  Any applicant seeking to develop communication 

facilities or tower compounds that fall within the jurisdiction of these regulations 
may request an informal  consultation with the Enforcement Officer and/or Building 
Inspector prior to the preparation and submission of a formal application.  The 
purpose of this voluntary consultation shall be to answer specific questions about the 
process or applicable design requirements, discuss possible camouflaging or co-
location options, or discuss application format options and/or potential supporting 
documentation submission needs.  Any such consultation discussions must occur 
before a formal application is submitted to the City, shall be non-binding on the 
applicant and the City, and shall not in any way constitute or be interpreted to 
constitute a decision to approve or deny an application. 

 
(b) Receipt of Application.  All required applications shall be submitted to the 

Enforcement Officer.  Upon submission, the Enforcement Officer shall determine 
that the application contains all submission requirements specified in Section 236 of 
this Article and is, therefore, complete.  No incomplete application shall be received 
by the City for review and approval.  Once the Enforcement Officer determines the 

 
 



 
 90 

 application is complete, the application shall be determined to have been received by 
the City on that date. 

 
(c) Enforcement Officer Review.  The Enforcement Officer and/or Building Official shall 

review a complete application within thirty-one (31) days of the date of receipt.  At 
the end of that review, the Enforcement Officer shall issue approval or denial for 
those aspects of the application that fall within the approval authority of the 
Enforcement Officer, as specified in Section 234, Subparagraph (a) of this Article.  If 
the application or any part of the application is denied, the Enforcement Officer shall 
provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining the specific findings of 
fact used by the City as the basis of the denial.  Such denial shall be based on the 
unwillingness of the applicant to comply with the requirements of the regulations 
and/or the failure of the application to satisfy specific basic requirements and design 
considerations outlined in Section 233 of these regulations.  If the Enforcement 
Officer fails to render a decision on the application within the required thirty-one 
(31) days, then aspects of the application subject to review and approval by the 
Enforcement Officer shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further 
consideration by the City.  However, the City Council may grant an extension to the 
thirty-one (31) day deadline not to exceed an additional thirty-one (31) days, due to 
extended illness or absence of the Enforcement Officer during the required review 
and approval period or the submission of an application that is too large or extensive 
to be reviewed by existing staff resources within the prescribed time frame.  On the 
date that the Enforcement Officer’s review period ends, any remaining portions of 
the application not subject to approval or denial by the Enforcement Officer shall be 
submitted to the City Council and/or Planning Commission for action, as may be 
applicable.  The forwarded application shall be accompanied by a written report from 
the Enforcement Officer regarding his/her assessment of the proposed 
communication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applicable requirements 
specified in Section 233 of this Article. 

 
(d) Planning Commission and City Council Review.  All applications or portions of 

applications requiring review and approval of the City Council and/or Planning 
Commission in accordance with Section 234, Subparagraphs (b) or (c) of this Article 
shall follow the same general guidelines as for an amendment to this Ordinance as 
specified in Article VIII (Amendments) of this Ordinance, with the specific 
exception that Planning Commission review shall not be required for applications 
that may be approved exclusively by the City Council, in accordance with Section 
234, Subparagraph (b) of this Article. 

 
(e) Public Hearing.  The City Council and, if necessary, Planning Commission shall 

each conduct one public hearing on the application at the earliest regular meeting 
date that will satisfy the public hearing notice requirements following the date of 
submission by the Enforcement Officer.  The required public hearing shall be noticed  

 



 
 91 

 in the same manner prescribed in the applicable Sections of Article V, Division 4, 
Section 345 of this Ordinance (Subparagraph [b] for the Planning Commission and 
Subparagraphs [a] and [c] for the City Council).  At the hearing, the presiding body 
shall entertain a report from the Enforcement Officer regarding his/her assessment of 
the proposed communication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applicable 
requirements specified in Section 233 of this Article.  A written copy of the 
Enforcement Officer’s report shall be incorporated into the minutes of the public 
hearing, along with a written synopsis of all public comments received and an 
attendance sheet identifying the names and mailing addresses of every person who 
attended the public hearing. 

 
(f) Decision.  The presiding body shall render a decision on the application within thirty-

one (31) days from the date that the public hearing is closed.  For the Planning 
Commission, such decision shall be in the form of a written recommendation, along 
with a list of the findings of fact upon which the recommendation was based, to the 
City Council for final action.  If the Planning Commission fails to render a formal 
recommendation on the application within the required thirty-one (31) days, then the 
application shall be transmitted to the City Council for final decision with an 
automatic or implied recommendation of approval.  If the City Council fails to render 
a decision on the application within the required thirty-one (31) days, then the 
application shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further 
consideration by the City.  If the application or any part of the application is denied, 
the City Council shall provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining 
the specific findings of fact used by the City Council as the basis of the denial.  Such 
denial shall be based on the unwillingness of the applicant to comply with the 
requirements of the regulations or specific basic requirements and design 
considerations outlined in Section 233 of these regulations that the application fails 
to satisfy. 

 
Sec. 236.   Submission Requirements. 
 

All applications to construct communication facilities that fall within the jurisdiction of these 
regulations shall provide adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance with all 
applicable basic requirements and design considerations specified in Section 233 of these 
regulations.  A single application may include any number of proposed tower compounds 
that will be located within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, even though some of the 
proposed tower compounds may be subject to expedited review procedures as provided in 
Section 234 of this Article.  Where an application includes tower compounds subject to 
different levels of review, the application may be divided into sections for each review 
category, within which all necessary supporting information for each proposed tower 
compound shall be provided.  Whenever portions of an application have been approved or 
denied through an expedited review process, that information and any terms of said approval 
or denial shall be noted and considered in the subsequent review procedures for the 
 



 
 92 

remaining portions of the application.  The Enforcement Officer shall determine the number 
of application copies that must be submitted by the applicant, based on the number of parties 
who must review the application.  One (1) copy of the application shall be required for each 
of the following review agents, as may be required: the Enforcement Officer, Building 
Inspector (if such person is not the Enforcement Officer), Planning Commission (as a body), 
and the City Council (as a body).  At a minimum, each required application shall contain the 
following: 

 
(a) A completed zoning permit application form, including the required application fee. 

 
(b) A site plan of the tower compound, prepared by a surveyor, at a scale not less than 

one (1) inch to fifty (50) feet, showing the location, street address, tax parcel 
identification number, and dimensions of the parcel of land that will contain the 
tower compound, the location of all required setback lines,  driveways, parking areas, 
buffers, fencing, landscaping, storm water management improvements, fuel tanks 
(both above and below ground), and structures that exist or will be constructed on the 
property.  If the property upon which a proposed tower compound will be located 
exceeds one hundred (100) acres in size, then the scale of the site plan shall be 
increased to one (1) inch to one hundred (100) feet, or the Enforcement Officer may 
grant authority to the applicant to limit the site plan coverage to a specified area 
around the proposed tower compound. 

 
(c) Written proof of ownership of the proposed tower compound or authorization to use 

it. 
 

(d) A written report including a description of the proposed tower or antenna with the 
technical reasons for its design, a certificate from the project engineer documenting  
the structural integrity of the tower or antenna support for its proposed use including 
any co-located communication facilities that may already exist at the site, and an 
affidavit signed by the owner of the proposed communication facilities and the 
project engineer attesting compliance of the proposed communication facilities with 
all applicable FCC requirements with regard to any potential detrimental health 
effects that could be generated by the proposed facilities. 

 
(e) A silhouette and elevation view of the proposed tower (or the existing tower, if the 

applicant is seeking permission to install an antenna on an existing tower) and all 
other communication facilities, and the tower compound, describing colors and 
materials to be used for the communication facilities and any security fence, 
decorative fence, and decorative wall.  The configuration of proposed antenna arrays 
must be shown on the silhouette.  The proposed location of future, additional antenna 
arrays must be shown on the silhouette by dashed lines.  The elevation view shall 
portray the general context and compatibility of the proposed facilities with respect 
to surrounding structures and natural features. 

 
 



 
 93 

(f) Copies of any proposed easements, where applicable to the project. 
 

(g) Documentation of the frequency band and wattage of the proposed communication 
facilities.

location site, a written report documenting the attempts made by the applicant to 
secure a suitable co-location site both within the city and in the adjoining 
unincorporated areas and any supporting technical reasons supporting the need for a 
new independent site. 

 
Sec. 237.   Inspection/Fee. 
 

To determine whether tower compounds are in compliance with the requirements of this 
Ordinance, the City shall make, or have made on its behalf, an annual inspection of the 
communication facilities on each tower compound and the walls, fences, and landscaping 
around each tower compound, for which an annual inspection fee of $200.00 shall be 
imposed.  If more than one antenna is located on a tower, the annual inspection fee shall be 
$300.00.  The fee shall be due on January 1 of each year and shall be delinquent if not paid 
by January 31 of such year.  To help defray the cost of collecting delinquent fees, an 
additional fee, in the amount equal to ten (10) percent of the fee shall be payable for each 
month, or portion of a month, after January in which the fee remains unpaid.  If the fee is not 
paid within three (3) months of its due date, the City may withdraw its permission for the 
location of communication facilities on the tower compound, in which event, all 
communication facilities must be removed from the tower compound within three (3) months 
of the day on which the owner or owners of the tower receive notice of such withdrawal of 
permission.  The fee shall be payable by, and shall be the responsibility of the owner or 
owners of the tower, even if additional antennas located on the tower are owned by other 
parties.  If there is more than one owner of the tower, each owner shall be jointly and 
severally liable for the entire amount of the fee and any additional fees due because of 
delinquency in payment.  Any inspection conducted in accordance with these regulations 
shall not be relate to the safety or structural soundness of the communication facilities or 
tower.  The purpose of the inspection shall be limited to determining whether such 
communication facilities and tower compound are in compliance with the provisions of this 
Ordinance.  Any violation of the provisions of the Ordinance that are discovered through 
said inspection shall be processed and resolved in accordance with the procedures specified 
in Article V, Division 5 of this Ordinance. 

 
Sec. 238.   Removal of Obsolete Towers. 
 



 
 94 

Any tower that is no longer serving an active communication use shall be removed at the 
owner’s expense.  The owner shall provide the Enforcement Officer with a copy of the notice 
to the FCC of intent to cease operations and remove the tower and all associated 
 
communication facilities from the site within three (3) months from the date that all 
operations ceased.  Where a tower serves as a co-location site, this provision shall not apply 
until all active users cease operation.  If the owner of the tower fails to remove the tower as 
required, the responsibility for removal shall then apply to the owner of the land upon which 
the obsolete tower is located.  Once the responsibility for removal has shifted to the property 
owner, the property owner shall remove the obsolete tower within one (1) month of the date 
that tower owner’s removal deadline lapsed.  If neither the owner of the tower nor the owner 
of the land removes the obsolete tower within the time prescribed herein, the City may, but 
shall not be obligated to, remove the obsolete tower.  If the City removes the obsolete tower, 
it shall be entitled to recover the cost of removal from the owner of the tower and/or the 
owner of the land upon which the tower is located. 

 
Sec. 239.   Satellite Dishes. 
 

All satellite dishes exceeding one (1) meter in diameter shall be considered structures 
required to be installed in accordance with all applicable provisions of this Ordinance, the 
Standard Building Code, and any other applicable regulations enforced by the City of 
Rainbow City.  All such dishes shall be located in the rear yard of the property, and shall be 
set back from all property lines a distance equal to the height of the dish. 

 
Sec. 240.   Appeals. 
 

All appeals from a decision by the Enforcement Officer or City Council shall be to the 
Superior Court or FCC as prescribed by the Telecommunication Act of 1996.

 (3) Topsoil Stripping 
   
  (a) Where present, all topsoil shall be stripped and removed from all construction 

areas. 
 
 (4) Proofrolling 
 
  (a)  Fill Areas 
 
   (1) Any areas that are to receive fill shall be observed and evaluated by a 

Geotechnical Engineer provided by the developer with a report to the 
City.  The evaluation shall include the proofrolling of the subgrade 
soils by a fully loaded triaxel dump truck, or other pneumatic tire-
mounted construction equipment approved by the Geotechnical 
Engineer.  The air pressure in rubber-tired equipment used for proof-
rolling shall be greater that 80 psi.  Proof-rolling consists of repeated 
passes of the equipment over the exposed sub-grade soils.  The proof-
rolling equipment shall be provided and operated by the Developer. 

 
   (2) Each area to receive fill shall be proof-rolled immediately prior to fill 

placement in that area.  Areas that have been proofrolled and have 
been subjected to rain or other wetting shall be inspected by the 
Geotechnical Engineer prior to fill placement.  The Geotechnical 
Engineer may order an additional proof-roll.  The Geotechnical 
Engineer shall report to The City after each subsequent proofroll or 
re-inspection after the initial inspection. 

 
   (3) Disturbed sub-grades resulting from excessive construction traffic, 

improper construction drainage, or other causes shall be undercut and 
replaced to the required depth.  Areas that have been proofrolled and 
then disturbed by construction traffic must be re-graded and proof-
rolled again. 

 
  (b) Undercutting 
 
   (1)      Any areas deemed by the Geotechnical Engineer to behave poorly 

under proofrolling loads shall be undercut to suitable soils prior to 
placement of any structural fill material.  All material deemed 
unsuitable to substantially support the embankment shall be removed 
to a suitable depth and replaced with stable material or rock as 
directed by the Engineer. 

 



 
 101 

 (5) Subgrade Stabilization 
 
  (a) In areas where soft soils are encountered to depths of 3 feet or greater, the 
   Geotechnical Engineer may require subgrade stabilization to reduce the 
                                    required undercutting.  Stabilization could include the use of a woven 
                                    geotextile (AMOCO 2002 or equivalent) and 8 to 12 inches of crushed 

stone,  
                                    geogrid and 6 inches of crushed stone, or 18 inches of crushed stone.  The  
                                    stabilization shall be performed under the guidance of the Geotechnical  
                                    Engineer provided by the Owner/Developer with a copy of all reports to the  
                                    City of Rainbow City. 
 
(b)  Fill Soil Testing.  
 
 (1) Suitable Soil Fill Material 
 
  (a)  Soil fill material shall be free from organic material and inorganic debris.   
   The fill material shall be free of rocks greater than 6 inches in diameter. 
   
  (b)  Select soil fill shall exhibit a Liquid Limit of less than 50 (as determined by  
   AASHTO T 89), and a Plastic Limit of less than 30 (as determined by  
   AASHTO T 90), and shall have a maximum dry density of no less than 100  
   pounds per cubic foot (as determined by AASHTO T 99).  Select soils shall  
   be used in the upper 2 feet of subgrade (as discussed below). 
 
  (c) Proposed soil samples shall be provided to the Geotechnical Engineer for  
   evaluation of the suitability of the material by laboratory testing.  Laboratory  
   testing of fill samples should include representative samples for every 500  
   linear feet of the proposed roadway.  In deep fills, the testing frequency may  
   be increased.  Test reports shall be provided to the City of Rainbow City  
   prior to fill placement being started.  All testing and reporting shall be done  
   at the Owner’s/Developer’s expense. 
 
 (2) Compaction Requirements 
 
  (a) The following table shows the compaction requirements for fill soils: 
 
   DEPTH                    DENSITY   MOISTURE 
   BELOW FINAL                PERCENTAGE*   CONTENT** 
 
   <5 feet                     95%         Within 2% of OMC 
   2 to 5 feet                    98%                                       Within 2% of OMC 
   0 to 2 feet                   100%                                        Within 2% of OMC  
 

   *Density percentage is the percent of maximum dry density, as determined by 
AASHTO-T-99.  



 
 102 

   **Optimum Moisture Content (OMG) is moisture content at maximum dry  
                  density, as determined by AASTO-T-99. 
 
  (b) Once final subgrade elevation is reached, the developer’s Geotechnical  
   Engineer may require field California Bearing Ratio (CBR) testing to  
   compare actual CBR valves with laboratory CBR values used in design of 

the  
   roadway.  Field CBR testing shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM D  
   4429 or by using a dual-mass dynamic cone penetrometer (U.S. Army Corps  
   of Engineers Penetrometer) and correlating the dynamic cone penetrometer  
   values to CBR.  Field CBR testing shall be performed every 500 feet. 
 
  (c) The CBR valves may require a thicker pavement and base build-up than the 

minimum thickness contained in these specifications.  
 
 (3) Compaction Testing 
 
  (a)  Compaction testing of each lift shall be conducted on each drive lane every 

100 feet.  Adjacent drive lanes shall have compaction test staggered 50 feet.  
All compaction requirements shall be met prior to placement of subsequent 
fill lifts.  The Geotechnical Engineer or his representative shall conduct 
compaction testing.  The Geotechnical Engineer provided by the Developer 
shall certify to the City that all compaction tests meet these requirements. 

  
 (4) Fill Placement 
 
  (a)  All fill shall be placed in horizontal lifts, not to exceed 8 inches loose 

measure.  Any fill being added to widen an existing embankment or slope 
shall be notched into the existing bank a minimum of 10 feet (horizontal 
distance).  The benching should begin at the bottom of the slope and then 
filled from the bottom to the top in horizontally placed lifts. 

 
(c) Evaluation of Cut Areas. 
 
 (1)  Proofrolling 
 
  (a) Cut areas that are at final subgrade elevation shall be observed and evaluated 

buy the Geotechnical Engineer.  The Evaluation shall include the proofrolling 
of the subgrade soils by a fully loaded tandem axle dump truck, or other 
pneumatic tire-mounted construction equipment approved by the 
Geotechnical Engineer.  The air pressure in rubber-tired equipment shall be 
greater than 80 psi.  Proofrolling consists of repeated passes of the equipment 
over the exposed subgrade soils.  The proofrolling equipment and 
Geotechnical Engineer shall be provided by the Owner/Developer. 

 
   



 
 103 

 (2) Undercutting of Cut Areas 
 
  (a) Any areas deemed by the Geotechnical Engineer to behave poorly under 

proofroll loads shall be undercut to suitable soils prior to placement of any 
structural fill material.  In areas where soft soils are encountered to depths of 
3 feet or greater, the Geotechnical Engineer may require subgrade 
stabilization.  Stabilization could include the use of geotextile fabric and 
crushed stone, geogrid and crushed stone, or only crushed stone. 

 
  (b) Cut subgrades shall have Plastic Indices (PI) of less than 30.  In areas where 

PI’s of 30 or greater are encountered at subgrade elevation, stabilized 
roadbed shall be constructed.  The stabilized roadbed shall be constructed by 
scarification or otherwise loosening of the upper foot of the exposed 
subgrade soils, and then blending in approximately 6 inches of ALDOT #4 
crushed stone aggregate.  The subgrade soils mixed with the aggregate shall 
then be compacted. 

 
(d) Field CBR of Exposed Cut Areas 
 
 (1) Once final subgrade elevation is reached, the Geotechnical Engineer or the City’s  
                        representative may require filed California Bearing Ratio (CBR) testing to compare  
             actual CBR values with CBR values used in design of the roadway.  Field CBR  
             testing shall be conducted using ASTM D-4429 or by using a dual-mass dynamic  
                        cone penetrometer (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Penetrometer) and correlating the  
  dynamic cone penetrometer values to CBR.  Field CBR testing shall be performed  
  every 500 feet. 
 
(e)  Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths 
 
 (1)  The Rainbow City Planning Commission shall determine the classification of all 

City  
  Streets.  All streets shall meet the following minimum requirements for right-of-way  
  and pavement widths: 
 
  
                        STREET         RIGHT-OF-WAY  PAVEMENT WIDTH

  around having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty (50) feet and a minimum  
  pavement radius of forty (40) feet.  If, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it  
  is desirable to provide street access to an adjoining property due to the probability of  
  future extension of said street, then said street shall extend by dedication to the  
  boundary of such property.  A temporary turn-around, or cul-de-sac shall be  
  provided for these streets.  The Planning Commission, after consultation with  
   appropriate department head(s), shall determine what type of base and surface  
  materials shall be permitted for such temporary turn-around.  In addition, at such  
  time said street may be extended, the temporary turn-around shall be removed and  
  the extension of the street shall conform to the requirements contained within these  
  regulations. 
 
 (2) Temporary turn arounds or temporary cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only if they are  
       part of a master plan to develop future roads.  All temporary turn arounds and  
  temporary cul-de-sacs shall be constructed to the same design standards and  
  specifications as roads / streets, except for the provisions requiring asphalt.

                                    accordance with the provisions of Article VI of the Rainbow City Zoning  
                               Ordinance. 
 
Sec. 316.  Stormwater Management Plan. 
 
      Revised by Ordinance # 490 – As required by City of Rainbow City’s Phase II municipal 
separate storm sewer (MS4) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES Permit, 
issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), the City must develop, 
implement, and enforce a Stormwater management program designed to reduce the discharge of 
pollutants from its MS4 to the “maximum extent practicable” to protect water quality and to satisfy 
the appropriate water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA).   
Please see City Engineer for complete Ordinance. 
 
(a)  Applicability.  Any person, firm, corporation, or business proposing to construct buildings or 

develop land within the City of Rainbow City shall apply to the Planning Commission for 
approval of a “Stormwater Management Plan”.  No building permit shall be issued or land 
developed except upon approval of such plan.  The following activities shall be excluded 
from the requirements of this section: 

 
(1)  Minor land-disturbing activities such as home gardens, home landscaping, repairs, or 

related activities. 
 

(2)  Construction of single family residences, when they are constructed by or under 
contract with the owner for his own occupancy. 

 
(3)  Agricultural practices or construction of farm buildings, when conducted in 

compliance with all applicable Best Management Practices. 
 

(4)  Private and commercial forestry activities, when conducted in compliance with all 
applicable Best Management Practices. 

 
(5)  Construction and/or maintenance projects undertaken and/or financed, in whole or in 

part, by: 
 

a.  The Alabama Department of Transportation, 
 

b.  Any county or municipality of the State of Alabama, 
 

c.  The Soil Conservation Service, 
 

d.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
 

e.  Any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service 
Commission. 

(b)  ADEM Permit Required.  For sites one (1) acre and above (or such requirements as 
subsequently adopted by ADEM), the developer shall furnish proof of obtaining an ADEM 



 
 113 

storm water discharge permit and shall be responsible for maintaining said storm water best 
management practices until the completion of the project. 

 
(c)  Design Criteria. 
 

(1)  The storm water runoff calculations shall be based on a 25 year storm frequency; 
however, if the property or drainage structure is located in a 100 year flood plain, the 
calculations shall be based on a 100 year storm frequency. 

 
(2)  The post-construction runoff shall be less than or equal to pre-construction runoff, 

based on the required design storm frequency. 
 

(3)  The content of the “Stormwater Management Plan” shall consist of measures that 
will safely convey runoff to a stable outlet, using storm drain piping, diversions, 
ditches or swales, retention structures, or similar conservation measures.  These 
measures shall minimize flooding and damage to downstream facilities resulting 
from increased post-construction runoff from the site.  The plan shall also provide 
provisions to minimize erosion from construction activities by the use of silt fencing, 
hay bales, check dams, sediment ponds, etc.  These measures for conveyance of 
runoff and erosion control shall be operational as soon as possible after the start of 
construction. 

 
(d)  Method of Determining Runoff.  Developments where the area contributing runoff is twenty-

five (25) acres or less shall be designed using the Rational Method of Calculating Runoff.  
Developments where the area contributing runoff is between twenty-five (25) and two 
hundred (200) acres shall be designed using either the Rational Method of Calculating 
Runoff or other methods as approved by the Planning Commission.  For developments where 
the area contributing runoff is two hundred (200) acres or more, the applicant shall use state 
regression equations or submit a method of evaluation for the calculation of runoff to the 
Planning Commission for review and approval.  All such development proposals shall be 
prepared by a licensed professional engineer. 

 
(e)  The Planning Commission may request assistance from qualified experts in determining 

whether the applicant’s proposed measures comply with these requirements. 
 
(f)  The Planning Commission may waive any one or all items in this section only if it is 

recommended by Staff Review to do so.

(a) Any nonconforming use which changes to a permitted use within the district in which it is 

located shall not revert to a nonconforming use. 
 
(b) A nonconforming use may change to a new nonconforming use, provided the new use is 

more in keeping with the district in which it is located and is less objectionable and measures 
less external impact than the existing nonconforming use.  In determining whether the new 
use would be in greater conformity with this ordinance, impact criteria such as, but not 
limited to, the following shall be evaluated: 

 
(1) Traffic generation and congestion, including truck, passenger car, and pedestrian

proffering in writing, signed by the property owner (and the authorized agent of the property 
owner, if any), of reasonable conditions in addition to the regulations provided for in the 
desired zoning district.  Any such proffered conditions must be made prior to the public 
hearing held by the City Council and must adhere to the following criteria: 

 
 
 



 
 122 

(1) The rezoning itself must give rise for the need for the conditions.

(8)  All such conditions shall be in conformity with the purposes and consideration of this 

ordinance. 
 
(b) The Zoning Administrator shall be vested with all necessary authority, on behalf of the City 

Council, to administer and enforce conditions attached to a rezoning amendment. 
 
(c) The official zoning map shall show, by an appropriate symbol, the existence of conditions 

attaching to the zoning.  The Zoning Administrator shall keep in his office and make 
available for public inspection a Conditional Zoning Index.  The index shall provide ready 
access to the ordinance creating conditions, in addition to the regulations provided for in a 
particular zoning district.  The zoning designation of the property shall carry a C suffix in 
addition to the zoning district designation (for example, R-2C), and the zoning map shall 
reference the Conditional Zoning Index by ordinance number. 

 
(d) Any amendment, waiver, or variation of conditions created pursuant to the provisions of this 

section shall be subject to zoning amendment procedures. 
 



 
 123 

Sec. 347.  Limitations on Rezoning Amendments. 
 

Should the City Council reject a rezoning amendment proposal by a property owner, the 
same kind of rezoning of the same tract of land will not be considered by the Planning 
Commission until a period of one year has elapsed from the date of such action by the City 
Council.  Further, a withdrawal of the application for rezoning after the hearing held by the 
Planning Commission, but prior to the hearing held by the City Council, shall also require a 
one year time period before another application may be submitted.  However, the Planning 
Commission may adjust this time period if, in the opinion of a majority of the Commission, 
an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing.  Each time 
the zoning amendment application is made, the required filing fee must be paid.  Under no 
condition shall the fee be refunded for failure of such proposed amendment to be enacted 
into law. 

 
Sec. 348.  Zoning of Annexed Property. 
 
(a) Automatic R-1 zoning.  All land annexed into the City shall be reviewed by the Planning 

Commission, and said commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council to 
bring annexed land into the city zoned R-1 Single Family Residential District unless 
otherwise specified.  All annexation ordinances shall reflect the approved zoning for the 
newly annexed property; such ordinances shall, immediately following annexation, be 
transmitted to the Secretary of the Planning Commission for Planning Commission action. 

 
(b) Planning Commission action.  Within 30 days following annexation, the Planning 

Commission shall review the R-1 zoning and, if determined necessary, initiate a petition to 
rezone the property to the most appropriate district.  In determining the most appropriate 
zoning, the Planning Commission shall duly consider the following minimum items: 

 
(1) The Rainbow City Land Use Plan, as adopted by the Planning Commission, as well 

as other relevant land use and planning studies; 
 

(2) The desires of the property owner subject to rezoning, as well as concerns of adjacent 
property owners; 

 
(3) The purposes and considerations of zoning, as required by this ordinance and section 

11-52-72 of the Code of Alabama. 
 
(c)  City Council action.  The Council shall, within 30 days of receipt of the Planning 

Commission recommendation, act to approve, disapprove, or modify the recommended 
petition of the Planning Commission.  In deciding their action, the Council shall follow the 
public hearing procedures found in this article.

serve upon the responsible person or owner of the property which is in violation of this 
ordinance, a citation to appear in the Municipal Court of the City of Rainbow City, at a time 
and date specified thereon, to answer the charge of such violation(s) of this article.  Provided, 
however, that prior to 12:00 noon on the date this matter is to be set before the Municipal 
Court, such person, firm, or corporation charged in such citation, if he has not previously 
settled or been convicted of three or more such violations within twelve months of the date 
of such citation, may dispose of the citation by settlement in the following manner:  pay to 
the Clerk of the Municipal Court a fine for the offenses charged in the amount of $25 plus 
any and all charges otherwise payable to the City pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
article.  If the offense charged is the third such offense by the owner or person charged 
within twelve months from the date of such citations, settlement cannot be voluntarily made 
to the Clerk of the Municipal Court as referred to above.  If the settlement of the charges set 
out in the citation is not made prior to 12:00 noon of the date the case is set for trial in 
Municipal Court, and if the party charged fails to appear and answer such charge in the 
Municipal Court at the time or place set out in such citation, or if the citation has not 
otherwise been disposed of by such court, a warrant shall be issued charging such party with 
the violation set out in the citation, which warrant shall be obtained, served and tried as 
provided by law for the arrest and trial of the offenses involving violations of the Ordinances 
of the City.  If a person receiving a citation as herein provided has, within the prescribing 
twelve months from the date of such citation, settled or been convicted of three or more such 
violations, he shall not be permitted to settle the instant alleged offense, but shall be required 
to stand trial in the Municipal Court. 

 
(b)  Penalty for violation.  Once the warrant has been issued and tried before the Municipal court, 

a person found guilty of such violations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be 
punished as provided by the General Ordinances of the City of Rainbow City, which shall 
include the payment of any fines levied by the Court plus any court costs as therein provided 
and issued by the court.  Each day such offense continues shall constitute a separate offense. 

 
(c) Issuance of citation. 
 

(1) All citations shall be signed by the enforcement officer finding such violations and 
shall be sent by certified mail to the responsible person or to the owner of the 
property on which the violation is found. 

 
(2) A warning of violation may be issued in writing, personal appearance, or telephone 

by the enforcement officer finding such violations.  The warning shall give an 
opportunity for correction of any violations within 30 or less days before a citation is 
sent, as provided in (1) above. 

Sec. 351.  Remedies. 



 
 125 

 
In case any building or other structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, 
repaired, converted, or maintained or any building, structure, or land is used in violation of 
this ordinance, the Zoning Administrator or any other appropriate authority or any adjacent 
or neighboring property owner who would be damaged or caused hardship by such violation, 
in addition to other remedies, may institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate 
action or proceeding to stay or prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, 
alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or use, to correct or abate such violation, or to 
prevent occupancy of such building, structure, or land.

 ARTICLE VI.  ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 
 
Sec. 360.  Creation. 
 

The City Council of Rainbow City hereby appoints a Zoning Board of Adjustment.  This 
Board shall, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, make 
special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance in harmony with its general purposes and 
interests and in accordance with the rules contained in this article. 

 
Sec. 361.  Composition and Appointment. 
 

The Board of Adjustment shall consist of five members, each to be appointed for a term of 
three years, except that in the first instance one member shall be appointed for a term of three 
years, two for a term of two years and two for a term of one year, and thereafter each 
member appointed shall serve for a term of three years or until his successor is duly 
appointed.  In addition to the five regular members provided for in this section, two 
supernumerary members shall be appointed to serve on such board at the call of the chairman 
only in the absence of regular members, and while so serving shall have and exercise the 
power and authority of regular members.  Such supernumerary members shall be appointed 
to serve for three year terms and shall be eligible for reappointment.  Appointed members 
may be removable for cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after 
public hearing.  Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term 
becomes vacant. 

 
Sec. 362.  Meetings. 
 

The Board shall adopt rules of meeting procedures.  Meetings of the Board shall be held at 
the call of the chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine.  Such chairman 
or, in his absence, the acting chairman may administer oaths and compel the attendance of 
witnesses.  All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.  The Board shall keep 
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if 
absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and 
of other official actions, all of which shall immediately be filed in the office of the Board and 
shall be a public record. 

 
Sec. 363.  Powers and Duties. 

 
(a) The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers: 
 

(1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, 
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the 
enforcement of this ordinance or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto; 

 



 
 127 

(2) To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such 
Board is required to pass under such ordinance; and 

 
(3)  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the 

ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special 
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in 
unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and 
substantial justice done. 

 
(b) In exercising the powers mentioned in this section, such board may, in conformity with the 

provisions of this article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, 
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, 
requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made and, to that end, shall have all 
the powers of the Zoning Administrator.  The concurring vote of four members of the Board 
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such 
administrative official or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is 
required to pass under any such ordinance or to effect any variation in such ordinance. 

 
(c) The Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, 

but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof 
as may be called on by such writ.  The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may 
be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be 
verified. 

 
Sec. 364.  Administrative Appeal Procedures. 
 
(a) Application for administrative appeal. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by 

any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected by 
any decision of the Zoning Administrator.  Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable 
time, as provided by the rules of the Board.  An administrative appeal shall require the 
submission of an application to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.  The application shall be 
filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 15 days before the scheduled hearing date before 
the Board of Adjustment.  A timely appeal shall suspend all actions on the decision appealed, 
upon issuance of a restraining order as described in § 11-52-80(c) of the Code of Alabama 
1975, as amended. The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized 
agent of the owner and shall include the following information and materials: 

 
(1) Name, signature, and address of the property owner and attorney for the property 

owner, if any. 
 

(2) Address of the property under consideration. 
 

(3) The decision of the Zoning Administrator under appeal. 
 
 



 
 128 

(4) A written statement specifying the grounds for appeal. 
 
(b) Board of Adjustment action.  The Zoning Administrator shall transmit to the Board all papers 

constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken.  The Board of Adjustment 
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, and due 
notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time.  Upon the 
hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The Board shall take 
action to uphold, modify, or overturn the decision of the Zoning Administrator. 

 
State law reference - Board of Adjustment, Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-80. 

 
Sec. 365.  Special Exception Procedures. 
 
(a)  Justification for special exception.  The Board of Adjustment may hear and decide only such 

special exceptions as it is specifically authorized to pass by the terms of this ordinance.  In 
exercising this authority, the Board shall determine whether special exceptions should be 
granted and grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate 
under this ordinance or deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and 
intent of this ordinance. 

 
(b)  Application for special exception.  An application for a special exception shall be filed with 

the Zoning Administrator at least 21 days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board 
of Adjustment.  The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent 
of the owner and shall include the following information and materials: 

 
(1) Name, signature, and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, 

if any. 
 

(2) Address of the property under consideration. 
 

(3) Zoning and land use of the property under consideration. 
 

(4)  Nature of the special exception, with reference to applicable zoning provisions. 
 

(5) The grounds on which the special exception is requested. 
 

(6) If applicable, a plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property 
boundaries and proposed development layout, with the special exception noted or 
highlighted. 

 
(7)  The names and addresses of each property owner adjacent to the property under 

consideration, including those across the street, as listed in the Etowah County Tax 
Assessor Office. 

 
 



 
 129 

(8)  A $100.00 filing fee. 
 
(c)  Notice of public hearing.  At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Board of Adjustment 

hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall give written notice of the special exception to all 
adjacent property owners.  Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United 
States mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at their addresses 
as submitted with the application.  The notice shall state the following information: 

 
(1) The name of the applicant. 

 
(2) The location of the property. 

 
(3) The nature of the special exception and the applicable zoning provisions. 

 
(4) The time, date, and location of the Board hearing. 

 
Public notice shall also be given, stating the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, and 
additional notice shall be posted on the premises affected. 

 
(d)  Board of Adjustment action.  In granting approval of a special exception, the Board of 

Adjustment shall make a finding that it is empowered under the section of this ordinance 
described in the application to grant the special exception, and that the granting of the special 
exception will not adversely affect the public interest. 

 
Sec. 366.  Variance procedures. 
 
(a) Justification for variance.  Variances to the terms of this ordinance may be granted in 

specific cases upon a finding by the Board of Adjustment that the variance will not be 
contrary to the public interest, that, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the 
provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and that the spirit of this 
ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.  More specifically, the Board shall 
determine all of the following criteria have been satisfied: 

 
(1) The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship, even to 

the extent of authorizing nonconforming uses.  Where the Board authorizes a 
nonconforming use in a district to prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors, 
when taken together, must indicate that the plight of the premises in question is 
unique in that they cannot be put reasonably to a conforming use because of the 
limitations imposed upon them by reason of their classification in a specific zone. 

 
(2) Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. 

 
(3) Hardship alone is not sufficient; Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship. 
 



 
 130 

(4) Mere financial loss of a kind which might be common to all of the property owners 
in a district in not an unnecessary hardship. 

 
(5) Variances should be granted sparingly, and spirit of this ordinance in harmony with 

the spirit of State law should be carefully preserved, to the end that the structure of 
this ordinance would not disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands 
of the Board. 

 
(6) When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for claim that a 

variance should be granted.

6.3   Hearing:  When a notice of appeal has been filed in proper form with the Board of Adjustment,  
        The Secretary shall immediately place the said request for appeal upon the calendar for hearing,  
        and shall cause notices stating the time, place and object of the hearing to be served personally  
        or by mail addressed to the party or parties making the request for appeal and to all adjoining  
        property owners as given in the last assessment roll as submitted by the applicant.  All mailed  
        notices shall be sent to addresses as supplied by the applicant.  Public notice shall also be given  
        stating the time, place and purpose of such hearing.  Additional notice shall be posted on the  
        premises affected. 
 
6.4   Withdrawal of Appeal:  If the applicant wishes to withdraw the appeal at any stage prior to the  
        determination by the Board, this fact shall be noted on the appeal application, and appropriate  
        copies, with the signature of the applicant attesting withdrawal.  The original shall be retained  
        by the secretary and filed with the minutes.  One copy of the appeal shall be returned to the  
        applicant. 
 
6.5   Amendment of Appeal:  Amendment of the appeal may be permitted at any time prior to or

        provide such information as may be needed to determine a particular case. 
 
6.7   Stay:  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the  
        Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of the appeal shall  
        have been filed with him that, for reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his  
        opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed  
        otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or, on  
        application, by a court of record when due cause can be shown. 
 

ARTICLE VII – VARIANCES 
 

7.1   Authority:  The Board is authorized upon appeal in specified cases to grant variances from the  
        terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to  
        special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in     
        unnecessary hardship. 
 
7.2   Filing Procedures:  A complete application for an appeal for variance accompanied by a   
       $100.00 application fee shall be filed with the Board. 
 
7.3    Notice of Hearing:  Upon receipt of the completed application form and the appropriate fee, the 
        Secretary shall immediately place the said request upon the calendar for hearing, and shall give  
        proper notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3. 
 
 
 



 
 A-9 

7.4   Standards of Variances:  Before any permit for a variance is issued, the Board shall make  
        written findings certifying compliance with the following specific rules: 
 
        1.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or    
             building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structure, or buildings in the  
             same district: 
 
        2.  That literal interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights  
             commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of the Zoning  
             Ordinance: 
 
        3.  That the special conditions do not result from actions of the applicant (self-imposed  
              hardship); 
 
        4.  That granting of the variance will not confer any special privilege on the applicant that is  
             denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
 
        5.  That granting of the variance is in harmony with the intent and purposes of the Zoning  
             Ordinance; 
 
        6.  That the variance will not adversely affect surrounding property, the general neighborhood,  
             or the community as a whole; 
 
        7.  That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structure, or buildings in the same district,  
             and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts  
             shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
 
        8.  That the variance will not allow the establishment of a use not permissible under the terms of  
             the Zoning Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication  
             prohibited by the terms of the ordinance in said district. 
 
7.5   Hardship:  In proving that a hardship has been imposed on the property as a result of the strict  
        interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance, the following conditions cannot be considered pertinent  
        to the determination of a hardship: 
 
        1.  Proof that a variance would increase the financial return from the land. 
        2.  Personal hardship. 
        3.  Self-imposed hardship. 
 
7.6   Minimum Variance:  In granting variances, the Board shall grant only the minimum variance  
        that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. 
 
7.7   Conditions and Safeguards:  In granting variances, the Board may require such conditions and  
        safeguards as deemed appropriate to insure that intent of the Zoning Ordinance. 
 
 



 
 A-10 

7.8   Hearings and Determinations:  Hearings and determinations on appeals for variances shall  
        conform to the requirements set forth in Article IX. 
 
7.9   Voidance of a Variance:  Failure of the applicant to conform to the conditions and safeguards  
        specified in the terms of the variance, shall be deemed a violation of the Zoning Ordinance and  
        voids the permit. 
 

ARTICLE VIII – ORDINANCE INTERPRETATION 
 

8.1   Authority:  The Board is authorized to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error  
        in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the  
        enforcement of this article or any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto. 
 
8.2   Filing Procedures:  A complete application for an appeal for ordinance or map interpretation  
        accompanied by a $100.00 application fee shall be filed with the Board. 
 
8.3   Notice of  Hearing:  Upon receipt of the completed application form and the appropriate fee, the  
       Secretary shall immediately place the said request upon the calendar for hearing, and shall give  
       proper notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3.   
 
8.4   Standards for Interpretations: 
 
        1.  The interpretation should expand beyond the specific case being considered and thought of  
             as having general, city wide applicability. 
 
        2.  Interpretation does not convey the right of legislation – the intent of the ordinance must be  
             upheld.  Interpretations shall serve to clarify the intent of the ordinance and map, but in no  
             case shall result in revision of the terms of the ordinance or intent of the ordinance and  
             zoning map. 
 

ARTICLE IX – HEARING, REHEARING, AND FINAL DECISIONS 
 
9.1   Hearing:  An appeal shall be heard within thirty (30) days from the time of filing unless the  

 appeal is withdrawn.  If amended to the degree that the appeal is different from its description 
in the public notice, the appeal shall then be heard within thirty (30) days of the filing of the  

        amendment.  Appeals shall be heard in order of receipt of application; amended appeals  
        according to the date of amendment. 
 
9.2   Order of Hearing:  The order of the hearing shall be:

        (6)  Rebuttal by Applicant or Agent 
 
        The Chairman may establish appropriate time limits for the arguments which shall be equal for  
        both sides.  The Chairman may request that representatives be selected to speak for each side. 
 
9.3    Rehearing:  Where there is a substantial change in facts, evidence or conditions, the Board may  
        accept an application for rehearing.  Any matter not previously reheard by the Board may be  
        heard again on a motion adopted by unanimous vote of all members. 
 
9.4   Final Decisions:  Final decisions shall be made by resolution within thirty (30) calendar days of  
       the last public hearing at which the appeal was considered.  A concurring vote of four (4)  
       members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or  
      determination of the properly designated administrative official.
