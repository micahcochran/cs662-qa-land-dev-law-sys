ARTICLE IV NONCONFORMING USES 
 

SECTION 40 Intent 
Within the districts established by this article or amendments that may later be adopted there may exist; 
lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this article 
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this 
article or such amendment. It is the intent of this article to permit these non-conformities to continue until 
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this article that non-
conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other 
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 

 
SECTION 41 Continuance of Nonconforming Use 
The lawful use of any building or structure or land existing at the time of enactment of this ordinance or 
amendment thereto may be continued, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this 
article, except that the nonconforming use shall not be: 
A. Changed to another nonconforming use; 

B. Reestablished after discontinuance for a continuous period of 6 months or 18 months during any 3 
year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises); 

C. Expanded, extended or enlarged in any manner which increase its non-conformity, but such structure 
may be altered to decrease its non-conformity. 

 
SECTION 42 Continuance of Building Occupied by Nonconforming Use 
A building occupied by a nonconforming use at the time of enactment of this ordinance or amendment 
thereto may be retained, except that it shall not be: 
A. Expanded, extended or enlarged in any manner which increase its non-conformity. 

B. Rebuilt, altered or repaired if such construction costs would exceed 50% of its replacement cost. 
 

SECTION 43 Exceptions 
A. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of 

any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public 
safety, provided such construction costs do not exceed 50% of its replacement cost. 

B. In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a single family dwelling and customary 
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record existing on June 5, 2003, 
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this article, only so long as it is used for a 
single family residence. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with 
other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the 
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard 
dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall 
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements 
shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Aldermen. 

C. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single 
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this article, and if all or part of the 
lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be 
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this article, and no portion of said parcel shall 
be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements 
established by this article, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width 
or area below the requirements stated in this article.

50.15 MU, Mixed Use District 
A. Purpose. 
The mixed use zoning category is a floating zone which is established for the purpose of providing a 
compatible mixture of commercial, employment, residential, recreational, civic, and/or cultural uses 
which are planned and developed as a unit.   The location of a mixed use district is restricted to areas 
which are designated mixed use (single-family, multi-family, commercial, office) in the Acworth 
Comprehensive Plan and Future Land Use Map. A mixed use development should complement 
surrounding areas. Among the goals of the mixed use zoning category are the following: 

 
1. Encourage residential uses in conjunction with commercial activities in order to create an active street 

life, enhance the vitality of businesses, and reduce vehicular traffic; 
2. Provide opportunities for horizontal and vertical mixed-use developments by permitting existing and 

planned commercial zones to be combined into unified development sites; 
3. Encourage compatibility between residential and commercial uses in areas where residential zones 

directly abut commercial zones, by permitting greater design flexibility across the existing boundaries 
of the two zones; 

4. Ensure that the appearance and effects of buildings and uses are harmonious with the character 
(topography, economy, society) of the area in which they are located. 

 
B. Effect and Procedure. 
The site plan for development within the mixed use district shall be in conjunction with a master 
development plan approved by the Board of Planning and Zoning and Board of Aldermen. The owner 
and/or developer of the tract of land proposed to be included in the development shall file a general site 
plan with the Zoning Administrator for recommendation to the Boards of Planning and Zoning and 
Aldermen. The plan shall contain information and representations required or deemed necessary by the 
Zoning Administrator, Public Works Director, Board of Planning and Zoning, and Board of Aldermen for 
proper review. The site plan will be reviewed and a determination will be made as to whether the plan is 
consistent with the intent and standards of the mixed use district and whether the development of the tract 
serves the public welfare. 

 
C. Permitted Uses. 
The following uses are permitted in the Mixed Use Zoning District: 
1. Single-family detached residential 
2. Multi-family residential (Including apartments and condominiums) 
3. Government administrative services 
4. Ambulance services 
5. Fire and Police protection services

unit as a principal use on the lot and only if the recreational vehicle is parked in conformance with 
this Ordinance. No more than one (1) recreational vehicle may be so occupied on the same lot. 

 
I. Landscape and Buffer Requirements. 
In general, the areas between the public rights-of-way and parking facilities or buildings shall be 
landscaped with deciduous trees and planter boxes or beds, using standards established in City of 
Acworth Tree Preservation and Replacement Ordinance, “Tree Protection and Landscaping”. The 
following additional landscape stipulations shall be required for mixed-use developments. 

 
1. In order to reduce problems associated with runoff and water supply contamination, innovative 

stormwater management techniques shall be used in all mixed use district developments. This could 
include porous pavement and/or perforated brick or block, ground swales, reconstructed wetlands, 
depressions, etc. In no instance shall a retention pond be constructed as the sole means of controlling 
stormwater. 

2. A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross area of the development site must be set aside as 
permanent undisturbed greenspace (or replanted area for sites already cleared). This percentage 
cannot include space within wetland, stream, or setback buffers. 

3.  (3) All off-street parking areas shall be set back a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from all other 
property lines, and at least ten (10) feet from any public right-of-way. 

4. (4) A buffer between a mixed use development and any surrounding residential developments shall be 
provided in the form of a minimum ten (10) foot wide, ten (10) foot tall landscaped area that includes 
native species trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses 

5. (5) Pedestrian pathways and sidewalks shall provide safe and aesthetically pleasing means of on-site 
movement and shall be an integral part of overall site design. Pedestrian pathways to buildings, 
parking areas, and other amenities shall be planned and installed in all developments. Sidewalks shall 
be required along all public roadways abutting the property and shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in 
width, paved, and shall include a minimum five (5) foot wide landscape buffer between the edge of 
the sidewalk and the boundary of the public roadway. 

 
J. Lighting. 
Lighting shall provide for the safe illumination of the site in order to maintain pedestrian and vehicle 
safety, security, and design accentuation. Building illumination and architectural lighting shall be indirect 
in character. Architectural lighting shall articulate the particular building design as well as provide the 
required functional lighting for safety of pedestrian movement. Pedestrian pathway lighting shall clearly 
identify the pedestrian walkway and direction of travel. All lighting shall be shown on site plans in 
sufficient detail to allow determination of the effects of such lighting upon adjacent properties and traffic. 

K. Design Provisions. 
It is the intent of the mixed use district to provide an environment of high quality building and landscape 
design. Special emphasis shall be placed upon methods that tend to reduce the overwhelming visual 
impact of large buildings, encourage tasteful, imaginative design for individual buildings, and create a 
complex of buildings compatible with the streetscape and neighboring areas in terms of design, scale, and 
use. 
1. Innovative and beautiful design is encouraged and welcomed as a means to enhance the overall 

quality of the built environment. 
2. Minimum conflict shall exist between service vehicles, private automobiles, and pedestrians within 

the site.

variance is obtained as in other cases. 

b) Buildings and structures established in connection with such use shall be set back not less 
than 100 feet from any property line. 

c) Upon written consent of all owners of property within 100 feet of the building or structure, 
the setback may be reduced to 50 feet from any exterior property line of the subdivision 
within which the use is located. Additionally, a detailed landscape plan must be submitted to 
and approved by the planning and zoning staff. 

d) The setback may be reduced to 20 feet from an interior property line of the property on which 
the use is located if a ten-foot landscaped buffer is provided along the property line and a six- 
foot solid wood or masonry fence is erected and maintained along the line so as to provide a 
visual and noise screen for adjacent property; provided, however, the setback after reduction 
shall not be less than 100 feet from an exterior property line. Such landscaped buffer shall be 
shown on the landscaping plan and must be approved by the planning and zoning staff. 

e) When a property line is on a natural waterway, a property line setback may be waived 
provided a written waiver is obtained from both the community development department and 
the planning division and zoning division.

properties are not adversely affected, and that roadways and safe use thereof are not 
adversely affected. No direct light shall be cast upon adjacent properties or roadways. If 
lighting is to be established, the use of environmental or cutoff type fixtures only is 
permissible. If lighting is to be established in a recreation area adjacent to an existing or 
proposed county public road, a lighting plan must be submitted and approved by the county 
department of transportation to ensure that no light is cast upon the roadway and that no 
adverse impact will be created as a result of the lighting. 

i) No residence or structures shall be built upon any adjacent lot within the development within 
which the facility is located until construction of the recreation area has commenced to the 
extent that buyers of adjacent property will be aware of where the recreation area will be 
located.

zoning district shall be established along the perimeter boundaries during construction until 
certificates of occupancy for affected lots are obtained. In the event that this undisturbed perimeter 
buffer conflicts with any required building setbacks, the required building setbacks may be altered by 
the zoning division manager or his/her designee, so to accommodate the 40-foot undisturbed 
perimeter buffer. The following uses shall be allowed within the undisturbed perimeter buffer (after 
certificates of occupancy are issued): public and private utilities, detention facilities, access drives, 
pools, decks, gazebos and fences. These uses shall not be allowed if an undisturbed buffer is 
stipulated by the board of commissioners. Required buffers may be included within required setbacks; 
however, in such case that the required buffer is greater than the required setback, the required buffer 
shall be adhered to. Additionally, necessary private utilities and access drives may be allowed 
through, over or across a landscaped buffer. Any such uses which are proposed through, over or 
across a designated undisturbed buffer must be approved pursuant to an original site plan or site plan 
modification.

ARTICLE VI SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
 

SECTION 60 Sidewalk Requirements 
 

60.1 . All owners, developers, or occupiers of parcels of land where a development permit or building 
permit is issued shall be required to provide a sidewalk adjacent to any public street along the entire lot 
frontage. Pedestrian pathways and sidewalks shall provide safe, all-weather, efficient, and aesthetically 
pleasing means of inter- and intra-site movement and shall be an integral part of the overall site design 
concept. Pedestrian pathway connections to parking areas, buildings, other amenities and between on-site 
and perimeter pedestrian systems shall be planned and installed unless otherwise excepted. 

 
60.2. All paths and sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide and paved. A minimum six (6) 
foot wide landscape strip should separate paths and sidewalks from the edge of pavement or curbs along 
public roadways. The landscape strip should be planted with canopy trees spaced a minimum of twenty 
five (25) feet on center at a rate of one (1) tree for every twenty (25) linear feet of lot frontage. Where a 
practical difficulty has been identified, the sidewalk shall be installed no closer to the edge of the road or 
the back of the curb than two (2) feet unless authorized by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. This 
requirement is waived for one- or two-family dwellings to be constructed on lots in existing 
subdivisions planned and developed without sidewalks. The requirement for sidewalk installation may be 
satisfied if the city holds a valid financial guarantee for the future installation of the sidewalks. 
Sidewalks or other pedestrian ways approved by the Board of Aldermen in conjunction with a 
subdivision shall be installed in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 

 
60.3. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any new building construction, new parking lot, or 
other permanent open-air use unless sidewalks meeting the requirements of this section are included on 
the site plan. Sidewalk installation may be delayed for a period not to exceed six months, provided that a 
financial guarantee is posted with the City. Acceptable guarantees include an irrevocable letter of credit, 
certified check, performance bond, or other guarantee acceptable to the City Attorney. Such guarantees 
shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five (125%) percent of the cost of the materials and installation and 
shall be accompanied by a written assurance that sidewalk installation will be completed to the 
satisfaction of the City within a specified period not to exceed six (6) months from the date the 
certificate of occupancy is issued. 

 
60.4. In such instances that sidewalks can not be installed along public rights of way that are owned 
by governmental entities other than the City, or when the installation is impracticable due to severe 
topography changes, the developer may request donation of new sidewalks with the equivalent lineal 
length on either another section of the development site or on other acceptable public property. The 
Zoning Administrator shall make the determination of the location. 

 
60.5. For any land or building development where sidewalks are required as outlined above and there is 
an existing sidewalk along the road or street frontage, an inspection of the sidewalk shall be made by the 
Zoning Administrator or designated agent. If the inspection shows the sidewalk is deficient or does not 
exist along the entire frontage, the owner must construct or repair the sidewalk as required by the 
Zoning Administrator. 

 
SECTION 61 Buildings 

 
61.1 Temporary buildings 
Temporary buildings and trailers shall not be allowed in any district except when utilized for construction 
site contracting work. Requests to utilize a temporary building pending completion of a permanent

other landscaping materials. 

 
63.2 Not be used for parking or contain any structure other than a fence or drainage improvement 
required by the City. Access through a buffer is allowed provided it is perpendicular to the buffer only 
and is designed so as to cause the least amount of intrusion possible. Bicycle and/or pedestrian paths and 
greenways are excluded from these restrictions. 

 
63.3 Utilize and preserve the natural topography and growth of the land except that which is necessary to 
prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove 
diseased or dangerous vegetation. Up to 40% of the required buffer may be cleared for utilization as a 
slope easement where required to prevent soil erosion subject to the approval of the Administrator who 
shall determine the minimum area necessary for said easement and the replanting schedule to be followed

66.3 Condition and Maintenance All portable storage containers and roll-off trash containers shall be 
delivered and maintained in good condition, free from rodents, insects, graffiti, vulgar and/or 
pornographic words or pictures. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner or occupant and the 
supplying company to maintain the portable storage containers or roll-off trash containers in accordance 
with the provisions of this section. 

 
66.4 Placement and Duration of Use 

a) TEMPORARY On all property zoned or used for residential, commercial, or 
industrial purposes, storage containers or roll-off trash containers may remain in use 
only so long as a valid building or trade permit is in place for the property on which 
the container is placed. No separate permit is required so long as the use is 
indicated on the approved site plan or building permit for the project. When no 
building permit is in effect, a roll-off container may not be placed on a lot for more 
than thirty (30) days unless authorized in writing by the Director of Planning or his 
designee. In residentially zoned areas, the container must be placed on the 
driveway or other approved pavement, and may not extend into the public right-of- 
way. Should existing site conditions not allow for the placement of a portable 
storage container in full compliance with these provisions, exceptions may be 
considered and written approval granted on a case by case basis by the Director of 
Planning or his designee, after consultation with the Public Works Director and the 
Fire Marshall. 

 
b) SEASONAL Metal storage containers may be temporarily located on property that 

is zoned for commercial or industrial use for no more than three (3) months within 
the same calendar year, provided that a building permit is issued for each such 
container. Containers cannot be vertically stacked, and shall not be placed in front 
of the principle structure, but must be located at the side or rear of the structure to 
minimize any visual impact from abutting streets. As a temporary use, they may 
occupy no more than ten percent of the required parking for the on-site principal 
use. 

 
c) PERMANENT Storage containers may be permanently located on property zoned 

or used for industrial purposes provided that a building permit is issued for the 
container, which must be properly anchored or tied down to resist lateral movement 
or overturning. If over 400 square feet, containers must be placed on a permanent

ARTICLE VII SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS 
 

SECTION 70 Special Land Use Permits 
 

70.1 Within each zoning district’s standards, certain property uses may be allowed provided they obtain a 
Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) from the Board of Aldermen. This additional review is necessary due to 
the increased possibility that such uses may have a negative impact on surrounding properties and their 
value. The City retains its right to subject certain uses to greater scrutiny to determine if they are 
appropriate or if additional safeguards may mitigate potentially harmful effects on neighboring properties. 
Table B below denotes those uses which are permitted only after issuance of a Special Land Use Permit 
and their permitted zoning districts.

SECTION 71 Community Residences 
71.1 Intent and Purpose. 
The Fair Housing Amendment Act (1988) states that local zoning regulations may not prohibit 
community residences and requires that municipalities provide “reasonable accommodation” of such 
uses. The City of Acworth regulates community residences using criteria based upon the actual use of the 
facility and the number of individuals utilizing its services. This provides individuals with opportunities 
for normalization instead of institutionalization thereby reducing social costs and fostering personal 
growth and responsibility while also allowing the City to maintain viable neighborhoods based primarily 
upon similar single family or planned multi-family dwellings. 

 
71.2 Group Homes. 
Group homes are defined throughout the entirety of this ordinance as dwellings shared by non-related 
individuals who live together as a single housekeeping unit and in a long-term family-like environment in 
which staff persons provide care, education and participation in community activities for the residents 
with the primary goal of enabling the residents to live as independently as possible in order to reach their 
maximum potential. This use shall also apply to homes for the handicapped; however, the term 
“handicapped” shall not include current illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance or alcohol, 
nor shall it include any person whose residency in the home would constitute a direct threat to the health 
and safety of other individuals. The term “group home for the handicapped” shall not include alcohol or 
drug treatment centers, work release facilities for convicts or ex-convicts, or other housing serving as an 
alternative to incarceration. 
1. Group homes with six or fewer residents, inclusive of resident staff, are permitted uses within the R- 

1, R-2, and R-3 zoning districts, provided: 
a) The structure meets all aspects of the Standard Housing Code including minimum dwelling 

space requirements. 
b) The operator of the group home obtains certification from the appropriate state licensing 

body. 
c) No other such facility or halfway house is located within 1,000 feet as measured from

Report, pursuant to Sec. 86-45. If any hotel or motel operator submits a monthly Hotel/Motel 
Occupancy Tax Report claiming that 3% or more of the hotel/motel Gross Rent is considered Non- 
Taxable Rent because it was generated from stays greater than 30 continuous days, then the city 
manager, or his/her designee, may inspect the books of the hotel/motel making such claim, including

I. If, after inspecting the records of the hotel/motel as permitted in (G) or (H) above, the city manager 
determines that a hotel/motel has permitted more than three percent (3%) of its rooms to be rented by 
guests staying on the premises for longer than 30 consecutive days then said hotel shall be deemed to 
be operating as an extended stay hotel and shall be subject to all zoning regulations of extended stay 
hotels, including the requirement to obtain a special land use permit. 

 
SECTION 74 Home Occupations 
A. Intent and Purpose. 
Certain occupational uses termed “home occupations” are allowed in dwelling units on the basis that such 
uses are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence. They have special regulations that apply to 
ensure that home occupations will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding 
neighborhood. The regulations ensure that the accessory home occupation remains subordinate to the 
residential use and the residential viability of the dwelling is maintained. The regulations recognize that 
many types of jobs can be done in a home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood and, as 
such, may be permitted provided such uses: 
1. Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence; 
2. Are conducted within the bona fide residence of the principal practitioner; 
3. Are compatible with residential uses; 
4. Are limited in extent and do not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood. 

 
Examples of permissible home occupations include residents use their home as a place of work, home 
office or business mailing address, artists, crafts people, writers, consultants, tutoring and family daycare. 

 
B. Special Land Use Permit Required: 
Home occupations must obtain a Special Land Use Permit from the City Manager or his designee due to 
their greater possible impact on the surrounding neighborhood as a result of individuals and visitors from 
outside the neighborhood coming to the property. Factors to be considered include the nature of the 
proposed business, the availability of parking, traffic generation and any other issue that may detract from 
the residential character of the area and property values. 

 
C. General Provisions and Prohibited Uses. 
All home occupations shall meet the following: 
1. A home occupation shall be incidental and accessory to the use of a dwelling as a residence. No more 

than 25% of the floor space of the dwelling unit (including attached and/or detached garages) may be 
used for the occupation. 

2. There shall be no exterior evidence of the home occupation or alteration of the residence and/or 
accessory buildings to accommodate the home occupation. Internal or external changes which will 
make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function are prohibited. Examples of such 
prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots (either paved or through use of other 
material – gravel, etc.), paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. Any 
alteration or addition which expands the floor area of the principal structure dedicated to the home 
occupation use shall void the existing business license and require a new business license be obtained, 
subject to property compliance verification by the Zoning Administrator. There shall be no outside 
operations or exterior storage of inventory or materials to be used in conjunction with a home 
occupation. 

3. Off-site employees shall not be permitted to work at the residence. 
4. No article, product or service used or sold in connection with such activity shall be other than those 

normally found on the premises.

business. 

6. No use or activity may create noise, dust, glare, vibration, smoke, smell, electrical interference or any

automobiles and their parts is prohibited. 

9. Group instruction, assembly or activity shall not be permitted (day care excluded). 
10. Accessory home occupations may not serve as headquarters or dispatch centers where employees 

come to the site and are dispatched to other locations. 
11. The Zoning Administrator must approve all business licenses which shall be recertified annually. 
12. The initial at-home application shall require the posting of a Public Notice sign, in a conspicuous 

place in the front yard no farther than fifteen (15) feet from the adjacent public roadway of the 
applicant’s dwelling, with the sign provided by the Business License office within twenty-four (24 
hours of submittal of the application. The sign shall allow the public opportunity to notify the Zoning 
Administrator of any concerns regarding the application. The Zoning Administrator shall not approve 
the application until ten (10) consecutive days have passed from the first day posting the sign. The 
Zoning Administrator shall approve or deny the application within twenty (20) days of the posting of 
the sign. Signs not posted in the manner stated above shall require the applicant to repost the sign as 
required and the ten day approval calendar to be restarted. 

13. Pickups from and deliveries to the site in regard to the business shall be restricted to vehicles which 
have no more than two axles and shall be restricted to no more than two pickups or deliveries per day 
between the hours of  8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 

14. Family day care facilities must be certified by Georgia Department of Human Resources prior to the 
issuance of a business license and must accompany all applications for a Special Land Use Permit. 
The number of children allowed by this ordinance shall be calculated at one child per 250 gross 
square feet of the residence with a maximum of eight (excluding those of the proprietor). The annual 
renewed certification from the Georgia Department of Human Resources shall be provided to the City

10, Article II, Acworth City Code. 

 
SECTION 76 Telecommunication Towers and Infrastructure 
Towers may be permitted in HI and LI zoning districts pursuant to the granting of a Special Land Use 
Permit from the Board of Aldermen. This additional review is necessary due to the increased possibility 
that such uses may have a negative impact on surrounding properties and their value. The City retains its 
right to subject certain uses to greater scrutiny to determine if they are appropriate or if additional 
safeguards may mitigate potentially harmful effects on neighboring properties.

determined not to comply with the code standards and to constitute a danger to persons or property, 
then upon written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service being 
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. 
The owner of the tower may appeal by filing a written appeal to the City Manager within 10 days of 
the receipt of the notice of non-compliance by the owner. The City Manager shall hold a hearing 
within 15 days of receiving said written appeal. In the event such tower is not brought into 
compliance within 30 days, the City may petition the municipal court for an order removing such 
antenna and/or tower and may petition the court for a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. 

 
F. Exceptions. 
1. Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property or owned by governmental bodies shall be 

exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna 
or tower has been approved by the appropriate governing body. 

2. A tower seventy (70) feet or less in height owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio 
station operator shall be exempted from these requirements. However, the owner or operator of such 
tower shall be required to comply with all applicable local, state and federal codes. Any existing or 
previously approved tower or antenna shall be considered “grandfathered” and will not be required to 
meet any additional requirements of this ordinance other than those in place prior.

ARTICLE VIII TRAFFIC AND PARKING STANDARDS 
 

SECTION 80 Purpose 
These standards are intended to provide the reasonable provision of future off-street parking within the 
City of Acworth; to restrict temporary storage of vehicles and recreational vehicles in residential districts; 
to alleviate any unnecessary traffic congestion which could result from on-street parking; and to 
encourage development and usage of off-street parking facilities. 

 
SECTION 81 Street Access and Curb Cuts 
A. Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel which abuts a public street for at least 40 feet or has 

access to a public street by means of a recorded access easement if approved by the Administrator 
and Public Works Director. 

 
B. Street access and curb cuts for service drives, entrances, exits and other similar facilities on public 

streets in other than residential districts shall be approved by the Public Works Director. Curb cuts 
constructed for new driveways to developments on arterial and collector streets shall be aligned 
directly across from existing curb cuts. The Public Works Director may approve other locations when 
it is determined that alignment with an existing curb cut is not appropriate. No curb cuts shall be 
located within 40 feet of any intersection or within 30 feet of another curb cut measured along the 
curb line. A curb cut shall be no greater than 30 feet in width, and no closer than 20 feet to any 
property line unless approved by the Public Works Director. 

 
C. All entrances or exits of any street or drive, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be 

approved by the state highway department prior to the construction of such street or drive, or the 
issuance of any development permit for any improvement to be served by such street or drive. 

 
D. No curb cuts for commercial developments may be placed along residential streets. 

 
E. All entrances or exits of any non-residential development or place of business shall be kept free and 

clear of any obstructions, including but not limited to parked vehicles or storage of materials, so as 
not to impede the flow of traffic onto or off a property. 

 
SECTION 82 Street Improvements 
A. The Public Works Director may require improvements such as the widening of streets, deceleration 

lanes and/or rights-of-way or the addition of curbs and gutters, in order to accommodate the increased 
traffic due to proposed developments. 

 
B. Existing streets shall be connected and extended throughout the limits of proposed developments. If 

such street is already used primarily for residential access, requested street improvements to provide 
access to a proposed non-residential use must be approved by the Board of Aldermen before being 
connected, extended or in any way provided access to the non-residential use. 

 
SECTION 83 Corner Visibility Clearance 
In all districts no fence, structure, sign, planting or other obstruction (above a height of 3 feet) shall be 
maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way unless approved by the Public Works 
Director. This requirement may be waived in the C-1 district, with the approval of the Public Works 
Director.

SECTION 84 Private Streets 
Private streets within any district shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this 
article. Private streets within any district shall be assigned names and locations and names of such streets 
shall be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits. All private street 
names shall be approved by the City to avoid conflicting street names. 

 
SECTION 85 Parking Spaces Required 
The required number of parking spaces shall be provided on the same lot with the use it serves, except: 
A. If vehicular parking or storage space required cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on 

which the principal use is conducted, the Board of Aldermen may permit such space to be provided 
on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 400 feet of the main entrance of such 
principal use and meets the storage requirements set forth in Section 65.   Such vehicular parking 
space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached 
upon in any manner. 

 
B. If a user within a planned shopping center is unable to meet the required parking spaces, no more than 

10 percent of the required parking spaces may be shared on an adjacent parcel of the same planned 
development and shall be located no more than 250 feet of the main entrance of the subject parcel. 
Such vehicular parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be 
reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 

 
C. The required parking spaces of any number of separated uses may be combined in one (1) lot, but the 

required spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that 
churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sunday may be 
assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sunday. 

 
D. No street parking spaces may be allowed as meeting the parking requirement except in the Central 

Business District. 
 

E. Stacking spaces shall be provided for any use having a drive-through facility or areas having drop-off 
and pick up services. Stacking shall begin at the window or communication/mechanical device (e.g. 
order board) first encountered by the vehicle user. All stacking spaces shall not impede upon on and 
off site traffic movements or create a potentially unsafe condition for either pedestrian or vehicular 
traffic. No more than 10 percent of the total parking spaces required for a user may be counted as 
stacking spaces. 

 
F. Vehicles parked within a non-residential parking area shall be parked within the designated parking 

spaces unless the vehicle is within a designated loading/unloading zone. Said parking spaces shall be 
clearly designated through paint lines, curb stones or other similar designations as approved by staff. 

 
G. No parking area may be used for the sale, repair, dismantling, servicing or long term storage of any 

vehicle or equipment. 
 

H. Required spaces. Table J enumerates the minimum off-street parking provision standards for all 
properties within the City. If a building or development contains multiple uses, the number of spaces 
required shall be calculated by summing the amount required by each individual use. Parking areas 
are encouraged to be set to the side or rear of the primary building in such a manner as to reduce 
visibility from the street (see individual zoning districts for density bonuses relating to parking 
location and/or structures).

ARTICLE XII AMENDMENTS 
 

SECTION 120 Generally 
A. This article, including the Official Zoning Map, may be amended by the Board of Aldermen on its 

own motion, or on recommendation of the Planning Commission, but no amendment shall become 
effective unless it shall have been proposed by or been submitted to the Planning Commission for 
review and recommendation; provided, however, that after any such amendment has been submitted

Amended: Ord- 2003-34; 2004-02; 2004-16; 2004-21; 2004-32; 2004-39; 2005-05; 2005-11; 2005-12; 2005-16; 2005-24; 2005-28;

counts at the nearest counting station(s) and specific road improvements necessary. 

d) Fiscal impact of the proposed development, such as estimated tax revenue to be generated. 
e) Impact of construction and permanent change in land use upon surrounding property, such as 

vegetation, noise, storm water drainage and air and water pollution. 
 

B. This application shall be accompanied by a fee to partially defray the public expense of processing 
the application. A fee shall not be charged if an official governmental agency files the application or 
if the rezoning is a result of O.C.G.A.§ 36-66-1 et seq., which requires all annexed properties to have 
a zoning hearing, provided said hearing designates a zoning classification which is the most 
equivalent to the existing county zoning. No advertising, annexation or rezoning fees shall be 
required for owners of existing residential properties that are seeking to have property annexed with 
no new development at the property. 

 
C. Applicants may request a meeting with the Zoning Administrator and other City staff to review a 

specific development proposal prior to the deadline for submitting an application to amend the 
Official Zoning Map. This meeting will provide staff an opportunity to informally review the 
development proposal and offer suggestions for changes and improvement. Applicants will be 
entitled to make changes to development plans before the application for rezoning becomes official. 

 
D. No submitted application may be amended after public notice of the request has been given unless 

changes are made in response to issues discussed at the Planning Commission Public Hearing and/or 
Board of Aldermen Public Hearing. 

 
E. The applicant or agent shall be present at the hearings before the Planning Commission and Board of 

Aldermen with regard to said application. In the event that an agent is present, rather than the 
applicant, such agent must have full authority to act on behalf of the applicant with regard to all 
matters pertaining to said application. 

 
F. The applicant must submit renderings, site plans and other exhibits purporting to depict what is to be 

constructed should a map amendment be approved; however, the applicant shall be required to 
develop according to such plans if approved by the Board of Aldermen. Any major deviation from 
such approved plans, such as adding new lots, layout change, change of building façade elevations, 
etc. would require another rezoning application be filed. The Board of Aldermen may also require or 
attach to any rezoning such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the 
proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so as to improve the quality of life 
through the protection against air, water and noise pollution and promotion of aesthetic 
considerations. 

 
G. An application may not be withdrawn by the applicant within 48 hours prior to a hearing on the 

matter, however, the Board of Aldermen may, by a majority of the members present, allow an 
application to be withdrawn without prejudice with respect to the 12-month limitation, or allow an 
application to be amended. Failure of the applicant or their representative to appear at the scheduled 
hearing may result in automatic dismissal with prejudice, rejection of the application or continuance 
of the hearing at the sole discretion of the Planning Commission or Board of Aldermen. 

 
SECTION 122 Assistance by Staff 
The Administrator upon receiving an application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map shall prepare 
and transmit a report to the Planning Commission and Board of Aldermen determining:

(2) The original and eight copies of the final plat and supplementary data, as specified in the plats 
and data section, shall be submitted to the administrator at least 20 days prior to the meeting of 
the Mayor and Board of Aldermen at which it is to be considered, and within six months after

(3) The administrator shall investigate the final plat and supplementary data to determine whether it 
complies with these regulations and other laws of the city and whether it conforms to the 
approved preliminary plat and recommended changes and shall so inform the Mayor and Board 
of Aldermen of his findings.

they shall require final approval by the Mayor and Bboard of Aldermen. If, however, upon review, the 
Mayor and Board of Aldermen find that such combinations or re-platting does result in a greater number 
of lots or parcels, such combination or re-platting must be subjected to the requirements of these 
regulations and receive conditional approval by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen before recording such 
plats.

require the subdivider to provide a written proposal stating the nature of the experiment. 

Section 35. Conditions 
In granting modifications, the administrator may require such conditions as will, in his judgment, secure 
substantially the objectives of the standards of requirements so modified. 

 
Section 36. Conflict with Other Laws 
Whenever these subdivision regulations impose more restrictive standards than are required in or under 
any federal or state law or applicable local ordinances, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. 
Whenever the provisions of any applicable federal, state or local ordinances require more restrictive 
standards than are required by these subdivision regulations the provisions of such laws or ordinances 
shall govern.

TREE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING 
A. Intent and Purpose 

The purpose of these standards is to facilitate the preservation and/or replacement of trees as part of 
the land development process within the municipal boundaries of the City of Acworth. Benefits 
derived from tree protection and replanting include: improved control of soil erosion, moderation of 
storm water runoff and improved water quality, dust filtration, shading, cooling, enhanced habitat for 
desirable wildlife, reduction of noise and glare, climate moderation, increased property values and 
aesthetic/scenic amenities. 

 
B. Applicability 

These regulations shall apply to all real property in the City now and in the future and to all property 
on which renovations to an existing building are greater than 51 percent of the building’s appraised 
value as shown on the current tax records. In accordance with the Subdivision platting procedures, all 
plats (preliminary and final) and subdivision improvement plans must contain a tree protection plan 
which meets the standards set forth in this section. Exempt from these standards are: 

1. Any singular residential lot occupied by not more than one dwelling structure containing (in 
aggregate) not more than two dwelling units. 

2. The plantings of public and private plant nurseries, tree farms or botanical gardens which are for sale 
to the general public. 

3. Any property undergoing renovation or for which an application for a building permit for renovation 
has been submitted to the City prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 

4. Any property within the Central Business District. 
 

C. Definitions 
1. Buildable Area - The portion of a lot which is not located within any minimum required yard, 

landscape strip/area, or buffer; that portion of a lot wherein a building may be located. 
2. Buffer - A natural undisturbed portion of a lot which is set aside to achieve a visual and noise barrier 

between land uses. A buffer is achieved with natural vegetation, except for approved access and 
utility crossings, and must be replanted when sparsely vegetated subject to the approval of the Zoning 
Administrator. 

3. Caliper - American Association of Nurseryman standard for trunk measurement of nursery stock. 
Caliper of the trunk shall be taken 6 inch above the ground for up to and including 4 inch caliper size, 
and 12 inches above the ground for larger sizes. 

4. Crown Dripline - The vertical line extending from the outer surface of a tree’s branch tips down to 
the ground containing the tree’s critical root zone (see Figure A). 

5. DBH - Diameter-at-breast-height is a standard measure of tree size and is a tree trunk diameter 
measured 4 ½ feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4 ½ feet, then the trunk 
is measured at the point directly beneath the split. 

6. EDF - Existing Density Factor (EDF) is the density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The 
EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. 

7. Land Disturbance Permit - An official authorization issued by the Department of Public Works, 
allowing defoliation or alteration of the site, or the commencement of any land disturbing activities. 

8. Protected Zone - All lands that fall outside the buildable area of a parcel, all areas of a parcel required 
to remain in green space, and/or all areas required as landscaping strips and/or buffers according to 
provisions of the City of Acworth Tree Protection Ordinance. 

9. RDF - Replacement Density Factor (RDF) is the density of new trees necessary to meet the minimum 
Site Density Factor. 

10. Re-vegetation - The replacement of trees or landscape plant materials into the minimum required 
landscape areas. 

11. SDF - Site Density Factor (SDF) is the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a

developed site. 
12. Specimen Tree - Any tree which has been determined to be of a high value because of its species, 

size, age, or other arboreal criteria [see Subsection (D)(4)(d)]. 
13. Tree - Any self-supporting woody plant, usually having a single woody trunk and a potential DBH of 

at least two inches. 
14. Tree Density Factor - A unit of measurement used to prescribe and calculate required tree coverage 

on a site. Unit measurements are based upon tree size and are not equal to individual tree counts. 
 

D. Tree Preservation and Replacement 
A tree protection and landscaping plan shall be submitted with all other permit drawings as part of the 
land disturbance permit process on any non-exempt parcel of land. Land disturbing activity includes any 
activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state 
waters or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, 
transporting, and filling of land, excluding agricultural practices. The intent of these standards is to 
provide the necessary information to facilitate development project design, plan review, and enforcement 
processes in order that the provisions of the ordinance are administered in the most effective manner. 

 
In general, it shall be required that a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of existing trees, exclusive of 
acreage contained within any street right-of-way, setback, stream, or wetland buffers, shall be retained 
after development in all zoning districts, as identified and defined in this Ordinance. In determining the 
number of existing trees to be retained, counts of individual trees shall be utilized. However, upon 
approval of the Zoning Administrator, a calculated percentage of tree canopy coverage (based on average 
trees per acre) may be used instead. All cleared or disturbed areas shall be planted with trees of suitable 
species and to densities specified in this section of the Zoning Ordinance. 

 
1. No land disturbance permit shall be issued for projects/lots until the landscaping plan has been 

reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator. All tree protection measures shall be installed 
prior to land disturbance and no land disturbance permit shall be issued for full site development 
without it being determined that the proposed development is in compliance with the provisions of 
these regulations. For each development, the Zoning Administrator, or other City designee, shall visit 
the development site, prior to issuance of any clearing permits. The tree preservation plan may either 
be a separate drawing or part of the overall landscape plan and shall include the following 
information: 

a) The name of the project 
b) The name of the owner and/or developer, including 24 hour contact 
c) The location of proposed building(s) and corresponding dimensions 
d) Spatial limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching 
e) All required undisturbed buffers, landscape strips and parking islands 
f) The location of all specimen trees or stands of specimen trees 
g) The location of all hardwood trees with a DBH > 4” and softwoods with a DBH > 10” 
h) Areas of tree protection and re-vegetation and all relevant tree density calculations 
i) The specific name and location of all materials to be planted or maintained on the site 
j) Procedures and schedules for the implementation, installation and maintenance of tree 

protection measures including, but not limited to, detail drawings of protective tree fencing 
(both active and passive) including signage and erosion control measures 

k) Planting and staking specifications 
2. The destruction within any two (2) year period of more than twenty percent (20%) of the trees on any 

parcel of land shall be considered as timbering and regulated as such unless site development plans 
are submitted and approved as per all applicable City regulations. When site development plans are 
not submitted, a timbering permit must be obtained prior to any tree cutting, clearing or clearing and

grubbing. This standard shall apply to all properties which are not zoned exclusively for single family 
use and to all properties over two acres in size irrelevant of zoning. Such permits shall be in 
accordance with current land disturbance permit plan review procedures and shall meet the following 
standards: 

a) The exterior boundary of the site shall have an undisturbed 50 foot buffer area. This buffer 
area shall remain undisturbed except for improved perpendicular access points, which may be 
no wider than 24 feet. Sites over 2 acres in size must retain a minimum of 50% of those 
hardwood trees with a DBH greater than 6 inches and 50% of those softwood trees with a 
DBH greater than 12 inches (inclusive of the required buffer). 

b) Submitted plans shall include the following information: 
1) Owner’s name and address 
2) Closed property boundary showing bearing and distances of all property lines 
3) Limits of land disturbance activity 
4) 24 hour emergency contact name and phone number 
5) Location of and detail for the truck exit (crushed stone pad) 
6) Delineation and labeling of all required buffer zones 
7) Documentation of all existing hardwood trees with a DBH > 6” and all existing 

softwood trees with a DBH > 12” 
c) All timber harvesting activities shall be in accordance with the U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 

404 and Recommended Best Management Practices for Forestry in Georgia. 
3. In the event that any tree on any nonexempt parcel of land shall be determined to be in a hazardous or 

dangerous condition so as to endanger the public health, safety or welfare, the tree may be removed 
upon the written authorization of the Zoning Administrator. In the case of a specimen tree which is 
included as part of an approved tree preservation plan, the Zoning Administrator may consult with the 
City’s designated professional arborist. 

4. The Site Density Factor (SDF) is the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed 
site based upon the total site area (see Table A). This density requirement must be achieved whether 
or not a site had trees prior to development. The required unit density may be achieved by counting 
existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two.

Existing Density Factor (EDF) is the density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The EDF 
is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units using Table B 
(below).

b) Replacement Density Factor (RDF) is the density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
Calculate the RDF by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. The density factor credit for each 
caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in Table C. Any number or combination of 
transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or 
exceed the RDF.

c) For additions to existing projects, the tree density requirements are calculated as noted above 

for only those areas in which new land disturbance is taking place. 
 

Ex: Sample Tree Density Calculation 
(1) A 2.2 acre site has a Site Density Factor (SDF) of 2.2 x 15 = 33 
(2) The Existing Density Factor (EDF) of trees to be preserved is calculated by converting the diameter 

of individual trees slated for preservation to density factor units as follows (all existing trees are 
assumed to be hardwoods): 

DBH # of trees unit value Totals 
24” 2 x 2.8 = 5.6 
18” 8 x 1.9 = 15.2 
10” 10 x 0.9 = 9.0 

    Total EDF 29.8 
(3)  Replacement Density Factor (RDF) calculates the minimum density of new trees to be planted by 

subtracting the EDF from the SDF: 
RDF = 44 - 29.8 = 14.2 units required 

 
 

(4) Table B is used to determine the RDF as follows: 
DBH # of trees unit value Totals 
2” 20 x 0.3 = 6.0 
4” 8 x 0.8 = 6.4 
6” 3 x 1.2 = 3.6 

    Total RDF 16.0 
EDF (29.8) + RDF (16.0) > SDF (45.8) therefore DENSITY SATISFIED

d) Specimen trees warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. In order to 
encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design 
of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully 
saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose [subsections (I)(3) and (I)(4)]. 
Credit for any specimen tree thus saved shall be calculated at twice the assigned unit value shown 
in Table E. 

 
If a specimen tree is to be removed, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the 
removal must be submitted to the Administrator.   Specimen trees must be replaced by species 
with potentials for comparable size and quality based on the unit value of the tree (for example, a 
30” hardwood specimen tree worth 4.5 units per Table B shall be replaced with 4.5 units worth of 
comparable species trees). Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review 
and approval of the Administrator must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to one and 
one half (1 ½) times the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree 
was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval. 

 
The following criteria are used by the Zoning Administrator and the appointed City Arborist to 
identify specimen trees. Both size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify. 

 

Size: 
• Large hardwoods: 18-inch diameter or larger 
• Large softwoods: 24-inch diameter or larger 
• Understory trees: 9-inch diameter or larger 

 

Condition: 
• Life expectancy of greater than 15 years 
• Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay 
• No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only) 
• No major insect or pathological problem 

 
E. Methods of Tree Protection 
1. The protective zone for designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the 

tree(s) canopy, as defined by the farthest canopy dripline of the tree(s). 
2. Construction site activities such as material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., may 

not encroach into designated tree protective zones. 
3. No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without 

prior approval by the Zoning Administrator. 
4. The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged over the protection of individual (non- 

specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization, 
increase the effectiveness of protection measures and prevent pathology. 

5. Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective 
zones. Utilities must be placed between tree protective zones or incorporate those techniques 
described in subsections (I)(3) and (I)(4). 

 
F. Protective Barriers 
1. Prior to any land disturbance, active protective fencing shall be installed so that it surrounds the 

critical root zones of all protected tree zones. 
2. Active protective tree fences must be at least 4 feet high and may be either a wood and post 

construction or orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing. 
3. All tree protection zones should be designated as such with “tree save area” signs posted visibly on

all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection 
process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards 
are recommended for site entrances although the developer shall be held responsible for any 
violations found. 

4. All specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones must be protected 
from the sedimentation of erosion control. Silt screening must be placed along the outer uphill edge 
of tree protective zones at the land disturbance interface and shall be backed by twelve (12) gauge 
two (2) inch x four (4) inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope. 

5. All erosion control must comply with the City’s Soil Erosion Control ordinance. All tree fencing and 
erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance 
process and building construction and may not be removed until landscaping is installed. 

 
G. Vehicle Use Areas 
1. Interior landscaping: Interior landscaping of at-grade parking lots shall contain planter islands located 

so as to relieve the expanse of parking, provide shading and channel water runoff. A maximum of 12 
parking spaces in a row shall be permitted without a planter island. In addition, planter islands shall 
be placed at the ends of all parking bays. Planter islands shall have a minimum of 125 square feet in 
area and shall contain at least one hardwood overstory shade tree having at installation a minimum 
DBH of 3 inches and 10 feet in height for each row of parking. If a double row of parking (spaces 
facing each other) is utilized, a single planter island shall be provided at each end of the rows, each 
planted with two trees. This requirement may be waived in those instances in which facing parking 
rows are separated by a continuous island at least five feet in width containing at least one tree every 
fifteen feet. The remaining area shall be landscaped with appropriate materials. 

2. Each area of the site which abuts public right-of-way (or improved accessways providing access to 
the interior of a development) must provide a planted border not less than 10 feet in width parallel to 
right-of-way lines (5 feet minimum for accessways). These planted border areas must have at least 
one tree having a minimum DBH of 2 inches for each 20 lineal feet of border area with a minimum of 
2 trees if the strip is greater than 25 feet in length. Pine species are excluded from parking islands and 
along right-of-ways/accessways. The remainder of the planted area shall be landscaped with 
appropriate materials. 

3. Accessways: Landscaped border areas may be interrupted to provide perpendicular vehicular and/or 
pedestrian ingress and egress, maximum 24 feet wide. 

4. Encroachment: Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular encroachment. Car stops 
shall be located so as to prevent damage to any trees, fences, shrubs or landscaping by automobiles. 

 
H. Encroachment 

Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is 
anticipated within the critical root zones of specimen trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated 
protected tree zones, the following preventative measures shall be employed: 

1. Clearing activities: Roots often fuse and tangle among trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree 
save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to 
cut minimum 2 foot deep trenches (e.g. with a ditch-witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as 
to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. 

2. Soil compaction: Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage, the tree 
protective zone must first be mulched with a minimum four inch layer of processed pine bark or 
wood chips, or a six inch layer of pine straw. 

3. Trenching: The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling 
rather than trenching. 

4. Grade changes: Moderate fill can be tolerated within a tree’s critical root zone with the prior 
installation of an aeration system. A decrease in grade is best accomplished through the use of

retaining walls or terracing. 
5. When irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones, the trees must be 

removed and replaced with new trees of comparable size. 
I. Remediation 

Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within 
protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the trees’ growing site and the damage is 
reparable. If encroachment is anticipated, these horticultural practices should be employed as 
preemptive measures to improve tree survival. 

1. Once a tree has been damaged, it is advisable to delay pruning until the deadwood becomes evident 
(1-3 years). Pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended. The removal of live plant tissue 
from a damaged tree can accelerate decline. Pruning of root severed trees may reduce the possibility 
of windthrow. Trees which have not been affected by construction activities can be pruned for 
maintenance of the tree’s health, appearance and safety. 

2. Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by site disturbances, thereby promoting 
root development. 

3. A tree’s adequate root development, and ultimately its chances for survival, is improved with 
reclamation of the growing site. Whenever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural 
grade. Compacted soils within the critical root zones of trees should be aerated. The air exchange, 
nutrient, and water holding capacities of soils can be improved with soil amendments. A 4 to 6 inch 
layer of mulch material, such as pine bark or wood chips, spread within the critical root zones of trees 
on construction sites, is extremely beneficial. 

4. The availability of water to trees on construction sites should be monitored. If grade changes or 
excessive rain cause the accumulation of water near trees, steps must be taken to improve drainage. 
Conversely, if grade changes or prolonged periods without rain cause a drought situation, then 
irrigation may be necessary. 

 
J. Re-Vegetation 
1. The replacement of trees must occur if the EDF does not meet the calculated SDF. The quantity of 

replacement trees must be sufficient so as to produce a total site-tree density factor which meets the 
requirements established in subsection (D)(4). (Note: the terms ‘unit’ and ‘tree’ are NOT 
interchangeable). 

2. Species selected for replacement must be quality specimens and ecologically compatible with the site. 
Table D lists those species of trees generally acceptable for credit in density calculations based upon 
use or need. The Zoning Administrator has information on trees and may accept alternatives to those 
listed in Table D. Pine species may only be planted in buffer or screening areas to the rear of the 
principal use and are specifically excluded from parking islands and along right-of-ways. Re- 
vegetation plans that consist of more than ten (10) new trees shall incorporate at least three (3) 
separate tree species whereby no single tree species accounts for more than 50% of all newly planted 
trees. In any case, no more than 50% of all new trees may be evergreen or pine species, regardless of 
their planting location. 

3. Any portion of the subject property which is within a utility power easement is required to meet the 
height standards of the controlling entity. These areas may be required by the City to have additional 
vegetation installed to compensate for these restrictions, subject to approval from the Zoning 
Administrator. 

4. All trees and landscaping shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and according to 
accepted planting procedures with quality materials as provided in literature from the Georgia 
Forestry Commission or the Georgia Extension Service. All landscaping shall be completed within 6 
months after the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, however any required fencing 
shall be installed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Should the landscaping not be 
completed in this period, it shall be deemed a violation of this section. The Zoning Administrator

shall have the authority to grant a two month temporary waiver to the planting requirement due to 
inclement weather, natural disasters or other such unforeseen instances. This waiver shall only be 
given upon written request from the owner/ applicant of the development project. The request shall 
state the reason(s) for the planting delay, and shall list the timeline for the plantings. 

5. The owner, occupant, tenant or agent, shall be jointly responsible for the maintenance of all 
landscaping. Landscaping shall be maintained in a good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and 
orderly appearance at least equal to the original installation. Any dead vegetation and landscaping 
material or any damaged nonliving landscaping materials shall be promptly replaced. 

 
A maintenance bond or letter of credit shall be posted prior to the issuance of a certificate of 
occupancy. This bond or letter of credit shall be derived through the average of three written 
estimates provided by the applicant from nurseries including the plant materials, labor and any other 
costs associated with the plantings. The bond or letter of credit shall be released by the City one year 
after the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. 

6. In the event that the minimum tree density cannot be met on a parcel, and after all other measures of 
planting have been exhausted, two (2) alternates, at the discretion of the Administrator, are available 
for compensation and issuance of approval. An allocation for alternate compliance shall not exceed 
more that fifty percent (50%) of the tree density for a specific plan. 

 
a) Tree Bank: 

It shall be at the discretion of the Administrator to designate site(s) other than said parcel 
for tree bank planting in order to achieve minimum density requirements. 

 
b) Tree Replacement Fund: 

It shall be at the discretion of the Administrator to allow contributions to the City of 
Acworth Tree Replacement Fund for planting of over-story trees at designated site(s) 
within the City of Acworth. Contributions shall be calculated as to reflect the current 
replacement cost (including labor) of the total number of trees that are required but are 
not planted. This amount shall be derived through an average of three written estimates 
provided by the applicant from nurseries including the plant materials, labor and any 
other costs associated with the plantings. 

 
K. General Landscaping Requirements 

Beyond tree protection and re-vegetation, the extent of permissible impervious surfaces and required 
landscaping are regulated through the standards of the controlling zoning district. Landscaping may 
include grass, hedges and trees as well as natural features. All site plans submitted for new 
construction or renovations to an existing building in which the construction costs exceed 51 percent 
of the building’s appraised value as shown on the current tax records (subject to those exemptions 
specified in Subsection B) must contain a separate landscape plan which includes the following 
information: 

 
1. The name of the project 
2. The name of the owner and/or developer 
3. The location of proposed building(s) and corresponding dimensions 
4. Spatial limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching 
5. All required undisturbed buffers, landscape strips and parking islands 
6. The location and listing of all specimen trees or stands of specimen trees 
7. Areas of tree protection and re-vegetation and all relevant tree density calculations 
8. The specific name and location of all materials to be planted or maintained on the site 
9. Procedures and schedules for the implementation, installation and maintenance of tree

M. Enforcement, Violations and Penalties 
Enforcement of the provisions of this section shall be the responsibility of the Zoning Administrator. 
In some cases, the City shall employ the expertise of a professional arborist to assist the Zoning 
Administrator. An arborist shall assist the City when: A) required as part of specific zoning 
stipulation and/or B) when an applicant has specifically identified significant sized specimen trees to 
save (Such as listed in Section D (4) d)). The arborist will become involved in the project over three 
time periods: 1) prior to any land disturbance the arborist would review the tree preservation plans, 
inspect the health of the proposed trees to save, and inspect the installed tree-save measures on-site, 
2) During the construction of the project the arborist would work with the Zoning Administrator to 
inspect that the proper tree-save fencing and other measures are being maintained, 3) After the site is 
completed the arborist would make a final inspection of the saved trees. 

 
If, after inspection of a project by the administrator or designee, the plant materials installed on the 
site do not comply with the approved plan, such deficiencies shall be noted in writing. If the 
administrator deems the deviations from the approved plan acceptable, they will so note, and the 
owner, occupant, tenant, and/or representative will be required to submit promptly a revised plan 
showing the actual plantings. This revised plan will be placed on file at the office of the Zoning 
Administrator. If, after inspection, the administrator or his/her designee determines the site does not 
comply with the approved plan and further determines it to be unacceptable, the owner developer, 
occupant, tenant and/or respective agent shall be notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator of 
said violations and given 30 days in which to correct all violations. Failure to make such corrections 
to plans not in accordance with the approved plan shall be a violation of this section and shall be 
punishable by a maximum fine or other punishment such as imprisonment, as set by the Municipal 
Court Judge. 

 
N. Appeal 

The Board of Aldermen shall have the authority to consider and act upon any application submitted 
for adjustment of standards provided herein.
