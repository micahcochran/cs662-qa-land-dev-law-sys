Zoning Ordinance, Section I: Short Title, September 17, 1991

SECTION I 

 

SHORT TITLE 

 

This Ordinance shall be known as the "Zoning Ordinance" and the map herein referred to identified 

by the title "Zoning Map of Opelika" and attested to by the City Clerk. The Zoning Map of Opelika 

and all explanatory matter thereon is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. Such map 

shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk and shall show thereon the date of adoption of this 

ordinance. 

 

SECTION 1.1 INTENT 

 

This ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate competing interests in the use, 

enjoyment and development of land within the City of Opelika. Every possible consideration has 

been given to the public interest, individual property rights and the impacts, or externalities, 

associated with the development of land in Opelika. It is the goal of this ordinance that both the 

burdens and the benefits it implies be rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and 

property owners of Opelika. 

 

Changes in zoning (rezoning) may appear to reduce the certainty of protection to owners of 

neighboring property and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to the City of Opelika. This 

ordinance contains standards and procedures intended to insure that neighbors, the 

citizenry-at-large, and the City of Opelika are protected from adverse impacts; and that the 

community's general welfare is protected and enhanced. Distinctions between zoning districts are 

significant and are based on the policies contained in the Opelika Comprehensive Plan. The 

districts are sized and located to meet the needs in Opelika for preservation of stable, existing 

development; for improvement of declining and transitional areas; and to encourage and promote 

growth and long-term economic stability. This ordinance contains clear, detailed procedures for 

the justified change of zoning district designations, in accordance with the Opelika Comprehensive 

Plan, as time passes. 

 

SECTION 1.2 PURPOSE 

 

The purpose of the ordinance is the implementation of the Opelika Comprehensive Plan, and the 

promotion of the health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the present and future inhabitants 

of the City of Opelika.  Specifically, it is the purpose of this ordinance to preserve and maintain a 

healthful environment by providing standards and procedures to control the density of 

development, to control the intensity of development in areas of sensitive natural resources, and 

to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts. Further, it is the purpose of this ordinance 

to regulate the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residences 

and other uses, and to establish standards so that all the people of the City of Opelika may have 

access to decent, sound, sanitary and safe housing. Finally, it is the express purpose of this 

ordinance to lessen the danger of congestion of traffic on the streets, roads and highways of the 

city; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and other dangers; to provide adequate privacy, light 

and air, to protect the tax base by facilitating cost effective development within the city; to secure 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section I: Short Title, September 17, 1991

economy in local government expenditures; to protect landowners from adverse impacts of 

adjoining developments; and to divide the incorporated areas of the City of Opelika into districts 

according to the use of land and buildings, the density of development, the intensity of such use 

and development (including height and bulk), and the provision of adequate open space.

shall be used until the Building Official of the municipality shall have issued a Certificate of

and accompanying maps, plans, or other information shall be transmitted promptly to the

after the decision appealed from by filing with the Administrator and with the Board a 

notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The City Planner shall forthwith transmit 

to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was 

taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless 

the Administrator certifies to the Board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a 

stay would in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case 

proceedings should not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order granted by the 

Board or by a court of record, on application and on notice to the zoning Administrator and 

on due cause shown. 

 

C. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an application or appeal, give 

public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest and decide the same 

within sixty (60) days following the hearing. At the hearing, any party may appear in person 

or by agent or by attorney. Public notice of the hearing shall consist of publication of such

as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Administrator.

17, 1991 

30 

D. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceeding and other official actions, showing the vote

SECTION 4.2 POWERS 

 

The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers: To hear and decide appeals 

where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made 

by the Zoning Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this chapter, to authorize 

upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary 

to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, the enforcement or the provisions of this 

chapter would result in unwarranted hardship and injustice, but which will most nearly accomplish 

the purpose and intent of this chapter, to hear and decide on applications for interpretation of the 

Zoning District Map where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a district boundary. 

 

A. Variances. The Board shall have the power to grant the following variances: 

 

1. A variation in the yard requirements in any district so as to relieve practical difficulties or 

particular hardships in cases when and where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, 

shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of 

such regulation or restriction, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other 

extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or the use or development 

of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of such regulation or 

restriction would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional 

hardship upon the owner of such property. Such grant of variance shall comply as nearly 

as possible in every respect with the spirit, intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, it 

being the purpose of this provision to authorize the granting of a variation only for reasons 

of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations sought by 

applicants for purposes or reasons of convenience, profit or caprice. 

2. No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds: That the strict application 

of this ordinance would produce unwarranted hardship; or practical difficulty that such 

hardship or difficulty is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district 

and the same vicinity; that the authorization of such variances will not be of substantial 

detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by 

the granting of the variance, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or 

building or structure that is prohibited in a given district. 

3. No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the condition or situation of the 

property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section IV: Zoning Board of Adjustment, Appointment, Duties, and Responsibilities, September 

17, 1991 

31 

nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of general regulation to be 

adopted as an amendment to this chapter. 

4. Whenever an application for a variance cancels or withdraws his application after an 

advertisement for a public hearing has been published, any rescheduling for a public 

hearing on said application or reapplication for the same variance shall be more than four 

(4) months after the original public hearing was scheduled. 

5. The procedure for amendment of a special exception or variance already approved, or a 

request for a change of conditions attached to an approval, shall be the same as for a new 

application, except that where the Zoning Administrator determines the change to be minor 

relative to the original approval, he may transmit the same to the Board with the original 

record without requiring that a new application be filed. 

 

B. Interpretation of District Boundaries. 

 

Application for interpretation of district boundaries may be made by any property owner, agent, 

tenant, government official, department, board or bureau to the City Planner on the forms provided 

therefore and in accordance with rules adopted by the Board. The application and accompanying, 

maps, plans or other information shall be transmitted promptly to the City Planner who shall place 

the matter on the docket, and the City Planner shall transmit a copy of the application to the 

Planning Commission, which may send a recommendation to the Board or appear as a party at the 

hearing. 

 

SECTION 4.3 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 

 

In exercising the above-mentioned powers the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of 

this Ordinance, reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify the order, requirement decision 

or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination 

as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal 

is taken. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any 

order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official or to decide in 

favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance or 

to affect any variation in such ordinance. 

 

SECTION 4.4 APPEALS 

 

Appeal to the Board of Adjustment and to the Courts. It is the intent of the governing authority 

of the City that all questions of interpretation and enforcement of this ordinance shall be 

presented first to the Zoning Administrator. Other than those applications and matters upon 

which the terms and provisions of this ordinance may require action and decision by the said 

Board of Adjustment, only the appeals taken in the manner and form as provided in this 

ordinance from the actions and decisions of the Zoning Administrator will be considered and 

acted upon by the said Board of Zoning Adjustment. However, any interested party who is 

aggrieved by any action or decision of the said Board of Adjustment may take an appeal there 

from to a court of law, as provided for in the State Law.

City of Opelika to develop as a residential transition district that permits residential lot sizes 

compatible with R-1 and R-2 densities.3

governmental buildings, parks, cemeteries, schools, the East Alabama Medical Center, and related 

medical uses. Uses in this district will be limited in order to establish areas for these uses and to 

protect them from the intrusion of incompatible uses.

A. The Retail/Entertainment District (the “R/E District”) is intended to provide an area in Opelika 

with a special classification for unique, mixed-use developments. The R/E District will be 

characterized by its focus on tourism, with a variety of entertainment venues, retail, service, 

and residential. Due to the intended uses, size, scope and breadth of the development, the R/E 

District will have a regional economic impact and cannot be reasonably served by existing 

zoning classifications and districts. Because of the District’s size, location and opportunities, 

modification of and limitation in the restrictions imposed by typical or conventional zoning and 

ordinances, including those governing noise, signage, parking and landscaping, is vital. The 

R/E District will be limited to developments meeting the criteria set forth herein and will only 

be granted upon application to and approval by the Council, No property may be zoned for R/E 

District status unless its meets the following criteria:

thousand (20,000) feet from the ends and each side of all active runways. 

Subzone B.  The area outside of Subzone A. 

 

B. Airport height definition. 

 

For the purposes of determining building height in the height notification zone, height shall be 

measured in feet above ground level, rounded to the highest foot. The total structure height shall 

include anything mounted on top of the structure, such as antennas, obstruction lights, lightning 

rods, etc. 

  



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

53 

C. Height notification regulations. 

 

All applicants of development proposals for land within the height notification zone determined to 

be a potential airport obstruction shall forward a notice of proposed construction (form 7460) to 

the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be reviewed for conformance with the obstructions 

standards detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77 Subpart C. (14 CFR Part 77), 

as may be amended from time to time. 

1. A proposed development shall be determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" if 

the proposed development would result in a structure or natural vegetation having a 

height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the ends 

and sides of a public use airport active runway at a slope of one (1) foot vertical to one 

hundred (100) feet horizontal outward to twenty thousand (20,000) feet for Subzone A 

or two hundred (200) feet above ground level for Subzone B. Applicants of any 

development proposal determined by the City to result in a structure(s) that constitutes 

a "potential airport obstruction" shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction 

during the development proposal review process by the Planning Director or his 

designee. 

a. No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for 

construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure which is 

determined by the City to be a "potential airport obstruction" unless a city airport 

construction permit is granted. 

2. Any proposed development which is not determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" 

is exempt from any airport height notification zone permitting regulations contained herein. 

3. Airport construction permit procedures and criteria for approval. Any applicant affected by 

a notice of potential obstruction may apply to the Planning Director for an airport 

construction permit. 

a. Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit. 

i. Applicants shall submit to the Planning Department a completed airport 

construction permit application form (as provided by the City) and a copy of the 

notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA for the project. Permit 

requests may be considered by the Planning Director concurrent with development 

plan approval consideration. 

ii. Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, applicants shall submit to 

the Planning Department the final determination issued by the FAA based on its 

review of the applicant's notice of proposed construction submitted in accordance 

with 14 CFR Part 77. 

b. Criteria for granting an airport construction permit. 

i. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its 

construction would not exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the 

Planning Director shall grant an airport construction permit for the proposed 

development provided that a condition is attached to the permit approval to ensure 

that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted prior to the issuance of a 

certificate of occupancy (C.O.) if so required by Chapter 14-60, in accordance 

with the standards of Rules of the Department of Transportation and Federal 

Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, as amended. 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

54 

ii. Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined that the 

proposed development exceeds the obstruction standards of 14 CFR Part 77, no 

airport construction permit may be approved, and a City airport obstruction 

variance must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed development to 

proceed. 

4. A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport 

hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air 

navigation than it was on the effective date of these regulations or any amendments 

thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 

 

7.4.07 Airport Runway Protection Zone and Regulations. 

 

A. Zone establishment. 

 

There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map a 

runway protection zone for areas at each end of every active runway as may be amended from time 

to time. Within a runway protection zone, certain uses are restricted or prohibited to reduce 

incompatibilities with normal airport operations and danger to public health. 

 

B. Runway protection zone regulations. 

 

1. Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited within the runway protection zone: 

a. Educational centers (including all types of primary and secondary schools, pre-

schools, child care facilities). 

b. Hospitals, freestanding emergency care centers, nursing/convalescent home 

facilities. 

c. Assembly halls. 

d. Fuel storage facilities (excludes storage tanks for flammable and combustible 

liquids, compressed gasses, or liquefied petroleum gas necessary for the operation 

of medical facilities) 

2. Permitted uses. Any use which is not prohibited in a runway protection zone as determined 

in a. above is permitted within the runway protection zone, subject to compliance with 

applicable airport noise impact zone, airport height notification zone and zoning district 

regulations. 

 
7.4.08 Airport Noise Impact Zone and Regulations. 

 

A. Zone establishment.  

There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map an 

airport noise impact zone for areas surrounding airport. The airport noise impact zone is an area in 

which special construction standards are recommended for new construction and alteration, 

moving and repair to minimize the impact of airport generated noise routinely produced by 

continuation of normal airport operations. The airport noise impact zone is defined as follows: 

1. An area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (½) the length of the longest planned 

runway on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. For land use control 

purposes, this boundary shall be considered to be consistent with the sixty-five (65) to 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

55 

seventy (70) level day night (ldn) zone determined by an official Part 150 Noise Study or 

other recognized study, such as an Environmental Assessment, if a study is completed. 

 

B. Noise impact zone regulations. 

Provisions of this section shall apply to construction, alteration, moving, repair and use of any 

building or structure within the airport noise impact zone. 

1. Applicants for building permits or permits granted by the Planning Department in the 

noise impact zone shall be provided information at the time of application regarding 

recommended amounts of noise level reduction (NLR) in the airport noise impact zone as 

established by this Ordinance as well as guidelines for how such noise reduction shall be 

achieved. 

 

7.4.09 Nonconforming Uses. 

 

A. Regulations not Retroactive. 

These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes 

or alterations of any structure not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date of this 

chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.  Nonconforming 

vegetation is subject to removal per the provisions of § 7.4. 

 

B. Marking and Lighting. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure 

or tree is hereby required to install, operate, and maintain thereon of such markers and lights as 

shall be deemed necessary by the Airport, Federal Aviation Administration, or State of Alabama, 

to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such obstructions 

in accordance with FAA requirements.  Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and 

maintained at the owner’s expense. 

 

C. Expansion of a Nonconforming Use. 

Any existing nonconforming use as described in these regulations shall not be expanded by 

altering, replanting or otherwise enlarging it so as to increase in any way its hazard within the 

airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing or taking-off or to increase the potential hazard to 

persons assembled within a structure so located and used. 

 

7.4.10 Permits. 

 

A. An applicant seeking development approval in an area within the airport overlay zones 

shall provide the following information in addition to any other information required 

in the permit application: 

  



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

56 

1. A map or drawing showing the location of the property in relation to the runway 

protection zone, height notification zone and noise impact zone. The City of Opelika 

Planning Department shall provide the applicant with the appropriate base maps on 

which to locate the property. 

2. Ground elevation profiles, a site plan, both drawn to scale, including the location (X and 

Y coordinates) and total height of all existing and proposed structures, measured in feet 

above the mean sea level. 

3. If a height variance is requested, the applicant will need to obtain a letter of support from 

the Airport. 

 

7.4.11 Enforcement. 

 

The enforcement of this Section shall be subject to the powers and duties specified under Section 

III of the zoning ordinance except as otherwise stated in this Section.  The Planning Director and 

the Building Supervisor shall coordinate the enforcement of this Section with the Airport.  It shall 

be the duty of the Airport to advise the Planning Director and the Building Supervisor of any 

violations of this Section. 

 

Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine 

of not more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six (6)  months, or 

by both such fine and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such 

violation continues shall constitute a separate offense (Section 3.4 Penalties). 

 

Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the City of Opelika Planning Department 

upon a form published for this purpose.  Applications submitted to the Planning Department shall 

be promptly considered and approved or denied.  Applications for variances by the Board of 

Zoning Adjustment shall be transmitted by the Planning Director. 

 

7.4.12 Special Requirements. 

 

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no use within the City of Opelika 

shall interfere with any operation of an airborne aircraft using a public use airport. The 

following special requirements shall apply to proposed developments or land use practices that 

attract or sustain hazardous wildlife populations on or near airports that can significantly 

increase the potential for wildlife-aircraft collisions. 

 

1. The distance between the Airport’s aircraft movement areas, loading ramps or aircraft 

parking areas and the wildlife attractant should be a distance of 10,000 feet.  A distance 

of 5 statute miles is recommended, if the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife 

movement into or across the approach or departure airspace.  For additional information 

please consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation 

Administration for standard practices for locating certain land uses having the potential 

to attract hazardous wildlife to or in the vicinity of public use airports. 

2. Sludge disposal, effluent spraying, compost activities and any other waste disposa1 

activities should normally not be allowed within the property limits of the Airport. 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

57 

3. Disposal sites for putrescible material, i.e. garbage dumps, landfills, and other similarly 

licensed or titled facilities, are to be considered incompatible when located within 10,000 

feet of the Airport’s runways. 

4. Disposal sites for nonputrescible material, e.g. construction demolition waste, 

automobile junk yards, kitchen appliances, and incinerator ash residue, are normally 

considered incompatible to within 10,000 feet of a runway used by turbine powered 

aircraft. However, depending upon the specific proposal, the results of a site 

investigation, and the proposed location relative to the runway approach/departure paths, 

certain types of restricted nonputrescible disposal operations may be found non-

objectionable off airport, provided assurances are obtained from the proponent, and 

included in the licensing process, that should the site cause an increase in bird activity 

which might be hazardous to safe aircraft operations, action will be taken to mitigate the 

hazard or close the site. 

5. Proposed developments which produce lights or illumination, smoke, glare or other 

visual hazards, or produce electronic interference with airport/airplane navigation 

signals are subject to the standards specified in the FAA Procedures Manual 7400-2C as 

may be applied and enforced by the state and/or federal governments. 

6. Vegetation in the airport north-south approach zone or the airport northwest-southeast 

approach zone must be removed if said vegetation penetrates the approach surfaces. 

 

7.4.13 Standards for Variances Applicable to the Airport. 

 

Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree 

or use property not in accordance with the regulations of this Section may apply to the Opelika 

Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance from such regulations.  Applications for variances shall 

follow the same procedure for other variances (See Section 4.1 Procedures).  The application for 

a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration 

(FAA) and the Airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation 

facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. 

 

A. Criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance. 

Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would 

exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the board of adjustment may grant an airport 

obstruction variance for a proposed development. Such a variance may be granted if the board 

determines that: 

1. The literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical 

difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to 

the public interest (i.e. the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace 

without adverse impact to surrounding environs). 

2. Granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation. 

3. Granting the variance will do substantial justice. 

4. The variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations. 

ALL VARIANCES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS AND TERMS AS 

RECOMMENDED BY THE FAA. 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

58 

B. The following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be 

approved: 

1. A condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved 

structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an 

obstruction in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number 70/7460-

1K, as it may be amended. Where such marking or lighting is required, such requirement 

shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) for the affected 

structure. 

2. The FAA must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid. 

3. Consideration shall be given to: 

a. The nature of the terrain and height (height per § 512.02) of existing structures. 

b. Public and private interests and investments. 

c. The character of flying operations and planned development of airports. 

d. FAA designated federal airways. 

e. Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the 

minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport. 

f. Technological advances. 

g. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air. 

h. Land use density. 

i. The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. 

j. The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or proposed 

structures identified in the City of Opelika. 

k. FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the 

FAA. 

l. Comments and recommendations from the Airport. 

m. Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts. 

 

7.4.14 Obstruction Marking and Lighting. 

 

Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose 

of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the 

owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense, to install, operate and 

maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of 

an airport hazard.1

SECTION 7.5 FLOOD PLAIN DEVELOPMENT2 

 

Ordinance No. 106-11 adopted by the Opelika City Council on April 5, 2011, known as the City 

of Opelika Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance shall overlay and supplement the regulation of 

the City of Opelika Zoning Ordinance, and shall be considered part of the Zoning Ordinance for 

purposes of administration and appeals under state law.  If any provision of Ordinance No. 106-

11 differs or is in conflict with any provision of the Zoning Ordinance, the provision imposing 

the greater restriction or more stringent standard shall be controlling. 

 

The regulations in Ordinance No. 106-11 shall apply to all lands identified as special flood 

hazard area by Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (“FIS”) 

dated January 27, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision 

thereto.  For those land areas acquired by the City through annexation, the current effective FIS 

and data for Lee County are adopted by reference.  Areas of special flood hazard may also 

include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering 

analysis by government agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS.  These 

special flood hazard areas (sometimes referred to and designated as “Flood Plain Overlay 

Districts” in the Zoning Ordinance) are declared to be part of the Zoning Ordinance and are 

hereby incorporated by reference.  A Development Permit shall be required in accordance with 

the provisions of Ordinance No. 106-11 PRIOR to the commencement of any Development 

activities.  No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without 

full compliance with the terms of Ordinance No. 106-11 and other applicable regulations.

SECTION 7.6 GATEWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT3 

 

This section authorizes the establishment of Gateway Corridor Overlay Districts. The intent of this 

section is to specify those areas that serve as a primary means of entry into Opelika and name those 

areas the Gateway Corridor Overlay District.  The district is designated to be an overlay appended 

to residential, commercial, industrial or any other districts.  The Gateway Overlay District is 

similar to airport hazard areas (Section 7.4) and the Flood Plain Overlay District (see Section 7.5) 

in that additional regulation will apply and supersede the underlying district regulations.  In other 

words, a Gateway Overlay District can be placed on top of any of the City’s existing zoning 

districts creating an overlap in the zoning along a specified length of roadway desired to be 

regulated.  Any proposed development, then, would have to meet the zoning requirements of both 

the existing zone and the Gateway Overlay district.  The Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall 

include roadway corridors and their adjacent development located in several use districts.  Uses 

typically include retail, wholesale, motel, recreation, office, fast-food establishments, and similar 

uses.  This district is characterized by special design controls enforced to prevent incompatible 

uses and to maintain an attractive “gateway” or entrance into Opelika.  The design of these 

corridors and their major elements shall reflect the identity and image of the entire City of Opelika. 

 

The Gateway Corridors are divided into two subdivisions based on the development pattern that 

the streets were originally constructed under.   

 

Gateway Corridor - Primary Overlay District 

Those corridors which were developed under more modern and suburban development patterns 

and to specifically accommodate automobiles are designated Gateway Corridor – Primary (GC-

P).  These corridors typically have larger lots with ample parking and buildings setback further 

from the public right-of-way.    

 

Gateway Corridor - Secondary Overlay District 

The corridors found in older sections of the City of Opelika and retro-fitted to accommodate 

automobiles area designated Gateway Corridor-Secondary (GC-S).   These corridors feature 

smaller, more standardized lots.  The structures on these lots are often smaller and located at 

varying positions on the lot based on the timeframe in which they were built.   Newer buildings 

are often setback further while, older buildings are usually closer to the right-of-way.    

 

The Gateway Corridor districts are designated as shown on the official City of Opelika Zoning 

Map 

 

The GC-P shall extend 150 feet from the outside edge of both sides of the right-of-way from the 

following street segments: 

 

 

1. Lafayette Parkway (Highway 431)  

2. Lake Condy Road (from Lafayette Parkway to Andrews Road) 

 
3 Date of Amendment: February 6, 2018 Ordinance No. 01-18 – Gateway Corridor P and S created and 

standards revised. 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

61 

3. Andrews Road 

4. West Point Parkway 

5. Columbus Parkway (from 6th Street to Fox Run Parkway) 

6. Fox Run Parkway and South Fox Run Parkway 

7. North Uniroyal Road (from I-85 to Ridge Road) 

8. Society Hill Road (from Gateway Drive to south limits of City of Opelika) 

9. Pepperell Parkway (from East Thomason Street to the Auburn City Limits) 

10. Fredrick Road (from Auburn City Limits to Martin Luther King Boulevard) 

11. Veterans Parkway (from Pepperell Parkway to Waverly Parkway) 

12. Marvyn Parkway 

 

The GC-P shall extend 300 feet from the outside edge of both sides of the right-of-way from the 

following street segments: 

 

1. Interstate 85 

2. Birmingham Highway 

3. Gateway Drive (from Pepperell Parkway to Society Hill Road) 

4. Columbus Parkway (from Fox Run Parkway to eastern limits of City of Opelika) 

 

The Gateway Corridor – Secondary Overlay District is designated as shown on the official City of 

Opelika Zoning Map.  The GC-S shall extend 150 feet from the outside edge of both sides of the 

right-of-way from the following street segments: 

 

1. Geneva Street (from Martin Luther King to Marvyn Parkway) 

2. Martin Luther King Boulevard 

3. East Avenue  

4. Samford Avenue 

5. 2nd Avenue (except those properties directly adjacent to the gateway corridor whose eave 

line is lower in height than a bridge crossing a railroad)  

6. South 6th Street 

7. South 10th Street 

8. McCoy Street 

9. Pepperell Parkway (from East Thomason Street to 2nd Avenue) 

10. Columbus Parkway (from Martin Luther King Boulevard to S 6th Street) 

 

The Gateway Corridors are subject to the “GC” district regulations in the matrix table in Section 

7.3A. The Gateway Corridor Overlay District is supplemental to the underlying zoning district 

classifications.  The Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall be imposed in addition to said 

underlying zoning regulations.  In any case where the standards and requirements of the Gateway 

Corridor Overlay District conflict with those of the underlying zoning district, the standards and 

requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall govern, unless specifically noted 

otherwise by the Zoning Ordinance. 

 

The Gateway Corridor Overlay District regulations shall not apply to platted subdivision lots for 

new single family detached dwellings and existing single family detached dwellings. 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

62 

The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant exceptions from the requirements of the regulations 

when due to the location, size and shape of the property, development of the parcel under its current 

zoning and in conformity with the requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District would 

present a substantial and unique hardship. 

 

References in the Zoning Ordinance to Gateway Corridor 1 District (GC-1) and Gateway Corridor 

2 District (GC-2) are deleted, repealed and eliminated and replaced by the Gateway Corridor 

Overlay District (GC), designated Gateway Corridor – Primary (GC-P) or Gateway Corridor – 

Secondary (GC-S).  Whenever in the Zoning Ordinance reference is made to Gateway Corridor 1 

District (GC-1) and/or Gateway Corridor 2 District (GC-2), or any like form, the same shall be 

construed to refer to the Gateway Corridor District (GC). 

 

A.  General Provisions. 

 

1. Establishing the Gateway Corridor Overlay Districts. 

 

Based on the definition and intent of these districts, Gateway Corridor Overlay Districts 

shall be recommended by the Planning Commission and designated by the City Council.  

Once designated, these areas shall be identified on the Zoning Map of Opelika. 

 

2. Applicability. 

 

All rules, regulations, conditions, and requirements set forth in this Section are applicable 

as follows: 

 

a. Except as provided herein, the Gateway Corridor Overlay District regulations shall 

apply to any land parcel, lot, or commercial group development within the corporate 

limits of the municipality when any portion of said parcel, lot, or commercial group 

development falls within required distance from a designated corridor as stated in 

Section 7.6. 

b. Any new subdivision, development, or construction in a GC-P and GC-S Overlay 

zoning district consisting of non-residential development or the development or more 

than two (2) residential dwelling units. 

c. An alteration to an existing non-residential or multi-family building(s), 

development(s), or construction which increases or decreases the amount of gross 

floor area of a structure or building on a lot by more than fifty (50%) percent. 

d. In cases where the GC-P or GC-S overlay property in the C-1 zoning district, the C-1 

zoning regulations shall apply. 

e. In cases where the GC-P or GC-s overlay property in a designated historic district the 

design guidelines of the historic district shall apply. 

f. See Section 7.7(a) and Section 7.8 for application of the GC-P or GC-S standards 

regarding the Village Commercial and Village Residential zoning districts. 

g. Where specific PUD, PRD, or R/E zoning and master development plans have been 

approved, any explicit standards designated through the master plan shall take 

precedence over Gateway Corridor standards.  In absence of alternative standards 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

63 

approved by the master plan, GC-P or GC-S standards shall apply to those properties 

with any Gateway Corridor designation. 

 

B.  Administration. 

 

1. Preparation conference. 

 

Prior to subdividing, developing or constructing in the GC-P or GC-S the owner or his 

representative shall meet with the Planning Department to review the feasibility of the 

proposed project in terms of its consistency with the Comprehensive Plan, surrounding uses 

and zoning, and the adequacy of existing or public planned facilities.  The owner shall 

provide the following information for consideration at this conference: 

 

a. A sketch plan showing the location and acreage of the project and the proposed layout 

of the streets and uses in relation to existing natural and man-made conditions.  This 

plan may be a free-hand sketch made on a copy of a topographic map. 

b. Proposed uses. 

c. Identification of proposed method of water supply and sewage disposal. 

d. Following the preapplication conference, and after the Planning Department has 

determined that the proposed use would be considered a conditional use, the owner may 

file a conditional use application (see Section 8.17 Conditional Uses) and submit 

supporting materials as outlined in subsection 2 below. 

 

2. Development plan and written report. 

 

A development plan and written report of the project will need to be submitted to the 

Planning Staff and will only be accepted after a preapplication conference.  This plan and 

report will be reviewed by the Planning Staff, other relevant City Staff (i.e. City Engineer, 

Public Works Director, Building Inspector, etc.)  

   

The following documents will be required for approval: 

a.  A conditional use application and submission if use approval is required for the proposed 

development or use meeting the requirements of Section 8.17. 

b.  A site plan shall be of a standard size and drawn by an architect, landscape architect, 

engineer or licensed surveyor meeting the requirements of Section 8.16. 

c. A written report describing the intent and general character of the proposed development 

may be required when deemed applicable and may include: 

1. A general description of the project; 

2. Any proposed standards for development, including restrictions on use, density, 

yard requirements and protective covenants; 

3. Any plans for the protective of abutting properties; 

4. Identification of any proposed dedication of land for public use; 

5. Expression of intent with regards to the provisions of open space, courts, walks, 

and other common areas and their maintenance 

6. Tables showing the acreage in the overall project and in each use, as well as density 

calculations for residential areas; 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

64 

7. A project completion schedule by phase; 

8. Any exceptions, variations or waivers from the requirements of the Zoning 

Ordinance that are being requested (i.e., the minimum lot area, width, frontage and 

yard requirements and maximum height requirements otherwise applying may be 

requested to be waived or modified for the purpose of promoting a more unified, 

reasonable, or appropriate site plan); 

9. Any other data requested by the Planning Department considered necessary to an 

understanding and evaluation of the project. 

10. This information may be included on the site plan, landscape plan, utility or 

engineering plans when deemed appropriate with the reviewing department.  

 

3.Reserved. 

 

4.Reserved. 

 

5.Noncompliance. 

 

The violation of any provision of the approved development plan shall constitute a violation of 

the Ordinance. 

 

6.General Development Standards 

 

a.  Lighting Requirements 

 

Light or glare from any operation and all lighting for parking areas or for the external 

illumination of buildings or for the external illumination of buildings or grounds shall be 

directed or located in a manner such that direct or indirect illumination from the source of 

light shall not exceed one foot-candle measured from any property line adjoining a 

residential zoning district.  Outside lights for nonresidential properties/uses must be made 

up of a light source and reflector so that acting together the light beam is controlled and 

not directed across an adjacent property.  It is the intent of this provision to prevent light 

from spilling over to adjacent properties in amount that can created negative impacts.  The 

zoning ordinance requires that appropriate lighting in accordance with the latest 

recommendations of the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) guidelines be followed.  It 

is recommended that for lighting parking areas, the developer use a vertical burn, super 

metal halide, forward projection fixture using cut-off type housing, i.e. shoe box type 

housing.  In addition, it is recommended that the poles be made of metal and of a platinum 

color to lessen their visibility during the day and that, the heights of the poles not exceed 

25 feet. 

 

b.   Materials and Cladding Requirements

HOD will be characterized by its focus in a variety of entertainment and art venues, retail, personal 

services, offices and restaurants.  Due to the intended uses, limited size, breadth of multiple land 

use development in the downtown area, the HOD may have a regional economic impact and cannot 

be reasonably served by existing zoning classifications and districts.  Because of the Districts 

limited size, location and entertainment opportunities; modification of and limitations in 

restaurants, bars/lounges serving alcohol, and other specialized land uses: Conditional Use 

approval from the Planning Commission is necessary for addressing public safety, noise/hours of 

operation, and other quality of life issues.  The HOD will be linked to development meeting the 

criteria set forth here and will only be granted upon application to and approved by the City 

Council.  No property may be zoned for HOD status unless it meets the following criteria: 

1. The Ultimate area of the HOD shall not extend beyond the boundaries of the C-1 

Downtown Commercial District. 

2. The initial location of the HOD will be those properties located on the one (1) block of 

South Railroad between 8th Street and 9th Street. 

3. All requirements of the Downtown Historic District administered by the Historic 

Preservation Commission shall be satisfied. 

4. All area requirements set forth in Section 7.3 Specific District Regulations; Subsection 

District Regulation; Area Requirements for C-1 (Downtown Commercial) shall be 

satisfied.

SECTION 7.10 RETAIL ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT10 

 

A. Purpose. 

 

The R/E District is intended to accommodate mixed and divergent uses within a narrowly defined 

area, which is largely self-contained and segregated from the surrounding developments. Because 

of the variant uses, it is intended that the R/E District be treated unlike and unique from any other 

district or zoning classifications. It is anticipated that the R/E District will be a tourist attraction 

with a regional impact and will generate traffic, noise and light, which will be greater than other 

areas. Therefore, the restrictions on the application of the R/E District as defined herein must be 

strictly applied. However, once established the R/E District will be characterized by an 

unconventional mix of uses that will, among other things, allow for multiple uses of parking 

facilities during any twenty-four (24) hour period without requiring each use to have an 

independent parking ratio as is required in other zoning districts. See Section 7.9 F. for parking 

regulation.

Administrative Subdivision of the Subdivision Ordinance, approve development plans and 

permit deviations from the master plan that are in keeping with the spirit and intent of the 

approved master plan and the ordinances affecting an R/E District. It is intended that matters 

dealing with platting and subdivision of any portion of the R/E District, development plans, 

signage, building height, parking, or traffic shall not need nor be required to have Planning 

Commission approvals; rather the Planning Staff and City Engineer are authorized to review 

and approve all such matters including but not limited to administrative subdivisions, access 

to public rights of way, and parking requirements. 

The Planning Staff shall act upon any request within forty-five (45) days of submission of 

any application. If no response is received by, the applicant within said period the application 

shall be deemed approved. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Owner shall have the right to request 

approval of any development related item by the City Council and the decision of the City 

Council shall be subject to appeal to the Circuit Court of Lee County, Alabama as in all other 

cases. 

 

D. Maintenance of Open Space. 

 

Whenever common open space is provided, the Planning Commission or the City Council, as 

appropriate, shall require that an association of owners or tenants be created for the purpose of 

maintaining such open space. It shall be created in such a manner that owners of property shall 

automatically be members and shall be subject to assessments levied to maintain said open space 

for the purposes intended. The period of existence of such association shall not be less than twenty 

(20) years, and it shall continue thereafter and until a majority vote of members shall terminate it. 

 

E. Parking. 

 

Within the R/E District, there will be numerous businesses and activities that will allow for shared 

use of parking facilities and areas that will serve as parking for some events but as other uses when 

not assigned as parking. Therefore, when reviewing parking needs for the R/E District, no specific 

parking ratio will be required. The Planning Staff and City Engineer must consider the uses, timing 

of such uses and functionality of the areas for the R/E District as a whole and not require each site 

to maintain a self-supporting parking requirement. The R/E District may have designated 

event/overflow parking that may be maintained as grassed or partially grassed areas. As used 

herein an event facility shall be one that is not open on a normal basis. Such designation as 

event/overflow parking shall not prohibit the designation of the same area for other uses or 

activities at times when not being used as parking. For example, an area used for a drive-in theatre 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

84 

may also be considered as parking for events such as a concert or other entertainment or retail 

venues. 

 

F. Green Space (Landscaping Areas). 

Any “green space” requirements for any property being developed within the R/E District shall 

be considered for the R/E District as a whole. The Owner shall submit an overall landscape and 

screening plan to the City Planner. Green space may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs, 

ground cover, and other materials such as rocks, water, sculpture, art, walls, paving materials and 

street furniture. Each site shall not be required to maintain a self-supporting “green” requirement. 

In considering the “green space” for the R/E District, the Planning Staff shall consider each and 

every area within the R/E District that maintains any grass or other vegetation toward any 

“green” requirement even if such area is used for some other use such as, for example, parking, 

and drive-in theatre or amphitheater.11

consistent in design and appearance with two (2) or more existing homes fronting along the same 

street (or adjacent street within the project) and shall be compatible with the predominant character 

of the homes in the neighborhood. The design and appearance of the new homes shall be regarded 

as supportive of neighborhood character when similar exterior materials, front elevation facades, 

building site and height, and roof pitch are used.  The developer shall provide scaled drawings, 

photographs, and/or renderings of the front elevation of the proposed single-family homes and 

existing homes in the neighborhood.  Residential buffers may be required between the 

redevelopment area and established older homes in the neighborhood to enhance compatibility.  The 

proposed project shall not result in a substantial or undue adverse effect on adjacent property, the 

character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions or public utilities and/or facilities. 

 

Subdivision and Zoning Requirements.  Residential Redevelopment Projects shall be allowed in 

the R-3, R-4, R-4M, R-5, and R-5M zoning districts with conditional use approval.  Residential 

Redevelopment Projects shall meet the density and building height requirements of the zoning

less than ninety percent (90%) of the average area of the existing homes located on the same street 

(or adjacent streets, if part of the project) within the Redevelopment Project.  When lots are recorded 

at the Lee County Courthouse, and said lots are proposed to be resubdivided for the purposes of a 

Residential Redevelopment Project with respect to said lots, then the lot area, setbacks, and 

maximum building area approved shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the zoning district. 

 

Adequate Implementation Work Schedule. The developer shall submit an implementation work 

schedule that represents the estimated time frame required to complete each work phase including a 

beginning and completion date.  The work phases shall include an overview of the work activities 

required to finance, construct, and complete the redevelopment project as well as an implementation

SECTION 8.17 CONDITIONAL USE14 

 

A. Purpose. 

 

Conditional uses are those uses that may have some special impact when proposed for location in 

particular zoning district or uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding environment cannot 

be determined in advance of the use being proposed d in a particular location. At that time, a review 

of the location, design, configuration, and impact is conducted to determine whether the proposed 

use should be permitted by weighing public need or benefit against the local impact. The review 

considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; planned 

and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by which it is 

suggested is necessary or desirable to provide a development that is in the interest of the public 

convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the area or the City of Opelika; and 

whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any 

adverse effect of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the proposed use on the 

immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and welfare in general. 

 

B. Applicability. 

 

Any use that is permitted as a conditional use by this ordinance shall comply with this Section.  Any 

permitted use proposed for development at a land use intensity that exceeds the maximum permitted 

by the district, provided it does not exceed the maximum allowed by this ordinance, shall comply 

with this Section.  Any renovations reuse, or preservation proposal that includes a change of use that 

is not allowed by the zoning district in which the structure is located, shall comply with this Section.  

Any use that involves filling of a floodplain shall comply with this Section. 

 

C. Procedure. 

 

1. Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted simultaneously with an 

application for a building permit unless prior approval has been obtained. Applications 

must be submitted (21) twenty-one days prior to the Planning Commission meeting at 

which they are to be heard. Applications for conditional uses in all districts must contain 

the following information: 

 

a. Applications involving new construction, additions, or site reconfiguration must 

comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.16 except for subsection E. 

Technical Information which is only required at the conditional use approval stage if 

requested by the City Staff or the Opelika Planning Commission.  This does not 

obviate any need for these items during a later site plan or technical review. 

b. Applications for conditional uses that do not require external modification or 

improvements, such as those in an existing building in a downtown environment or 

suite in an existing and multi-tenant building, may with approval of the Planning 

Director submit a reduced conditional use application limited to the internal space or 

other relevant information.

2. The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds either that the 

application and records fail to establish compliance with the standards made applicable to 

the proposed location, will be inconsistent with the standards applicable to it pursuant to 

the provisions of this ordinance. Further, the application shall be denied if the adverse 

impacts of the development, after taking into consideration any proposals of the applicant 

and any conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission pursuant to the 

provisions of this ordinance to ameliorate them, outweigh any public or private benefits 

of the proposal and require denial of the conditional use approval in the interest of the 

overall public health, safety, and welfare. 

 

3. In order to prevent or minimize adverse affects from the proposed use and development. 

On other properties in the neighborhood and on the general health, safety, and welfare of 

the City of Opelika, the Planning Commission may, in approving the application for any 

conditional use permit, impose such restrictions and conditions on such approval, the 

proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant to such approval as it 

determines are required by the general purposes, goals and objectives of the 

Comprehensive Plan and this ordinance.  All conditions imposed upon any conditional 

use permit approval, with the exception of conditions made applicable to such approval 

by the express terms of this ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in the resolution 

granting such conditional use permits. 

 

4. Within thirty (30) days of the public hearing on the application, unless an extension of this 

time is agreed to by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall either grant the 

application for a conditional use permit, grant it subject to conditions, or deny it.  The 

failure of the Planning Commission to act within this time period shall constitute a 

decision by it that the application be approved. 

 

5. In the event a permit for conditional use is approved or approved subject to conditions, 

the applicant shall in writing within fifteen (15) days following such decision, 

acknowledge such approval and unconditionally accept and agree to any conditions 

imposed on the approval.  The City Planner shall then take action to process the 

application on the zoning certificate for the development to which the conditional use 

permit applies.  In the event such permit is not approved or is approved subject to 

conditions that are not acceptable to the applicant, the applicant may, within the aforesaid 

time period, either appeal such decision to Circuit Court or abandon the application at the 

expiration of this fifteen (15) day period. 

 

6. A conditional use shall expire one (1) year from the date of approval if a valid, current 

building permit has not been obtained.  If the building permit expires or if no building 

permit is obtained within a year of being granted approval, then the petitioner shall need 

to resubmit a conditional use application and comply with the zoning ordinance in effect 

at the time of the resubmitted before proceeding with the conditional use.

3. There shall be a community need for the proposed use and a need to provide or maintain 

a proper mix of uses both within Opelika and also within the immediate area of the 

proposed use: (a) the proposed use shall not result in either a detrimental concentration of 

a particular use within the City or within the immediate area; and (b) the area for which 

the use is proposed is not better suited for or likely to be needed for the uses that are 

permitted as a matter of right within that district, in light of policies or programs of the 

City of Opelika.

effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, 

public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public 

health, safety, and general welfare, either as they not exist or as they may in the future be 

developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and polices of the 

Comprehensive Plan, this ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance 

adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other 

governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development.

SECTION 8.18.1 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (PRD)16 

 

A.  Purpose. 

The intent of this section is to provide alternatives to the conventional residential development 

regulations that are permitted in Opelika’s Land Development Regulations protecting existing land 

uses and property values. This section permits greater flexibility in residential design in order to 

encourage innovative residential plans, promote superior residential developments, and offer 

neighborhood amenities such as usable open space, designated recreational areas, sidewalks, 

decorative street lighting, and streetscapes. The Planning Commission will determine if the 

application, subdivision plan, and site design conform to the requirements of these regulations and 

that the development will accomplish the following purposes: 

1. To ensure compatibility is achieved with adjacent land uses that differ in function, scale, and 

intensity17 or with future adjacent land uses based on adjacent zoning districts. Compatibility 

is achieved when adjacent land uses do not create adverse effects upon one another. The 

subdivision layout and design should reflect the inherent character of the existing land uses 

yet demonstrate distinctive features that will give the development a sense of identity. In 

areas where different uses abut, a variety of measures may be employed to ensure 

compatibility including: the use of adequate setbacks, landscaping, perimeter buffers, and 

building height considerations. 

2. To conserve and preserve land to assure that its development will best maintain or enhance 

the appearance, character, natural beauty and historic interest of an area; 

3. To preserve land for common area for neighborhood amenities; 

4. To encourage development in such a way as to promote the most appropriate use of land, 

considering its particular size and topography, to protect natural drainage systems, streams, 

wetlands, floodplains, and to properly manage for stormwater runoff and erosion and 

sedimentation control. 

  

 
16 Date of Amendment: November 6, 2001 Ordinance No. 165-01 
17 Intensity refers to comparing the impact of a proposed development with adjacent land uses and zoning districts by 

evaluating characteristics such as the number of dwelling units per acre and amount of site coverage. Scale and bulk 

refers to dwellings that are of reasonable proportions (size, height) to existing dwellings and dwellings that are 

reasonably consistent and compatible with a style and the character in the vicinity.

Common open space shall be an integrated with the total PRD development by utilizing and 

preserving existing site amenities and minimizing the disturbance of the natural environment. 

Natural drainage areas shall be retained. Environmentally sensitive areas (streams, wetlands) shall 

be preserved and maintained as private open space. Significant stands of trees and individual trees 

shall be preserved. Drainage areas shall be incorporated as aesthetic amenities and/or designated 

open space trails. Improvements in the common open space must be shown on the site plan and 

installed by the developer. The developer must demonstrate how the PRD will comply with the 

above standards through the design and layout of the proposed development and contours shown on 

the final grading plan. 

 

Useable open space area is defined as an area that is capable of being used and enjoyed for passive 

recreation (such as walking or jogging) and that if left in its natural or undisturbed state (from the 

date development began), is consistent with the objective of providing passive recreational 

opportunities. Usable open space area shall have a minimum area of ten thousand (10,000) square 

feet. A sidewalk constructed at least four feet wide running along a street may be designated usable 

open space. A walking or jogging trail maybe cut from an wooded area that is to be designated usable 

open space or if not wooded at the time of development, is properly vegetated and landscaped with 

the objective of creating a wooded area. All usable open space areas shall be accessible by sidewalk 

from the residential developed portions of the PRD. 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

127 

Maintenance of common and useable open space areas and sidewalks shall be the responsibility of 

the PRD owner(s) or homeowners association as designated by the developer. The developer shall 

record covenants and restrictions that provide maintenance procedures for the common and useable 

open space areas to ensure open spaces are maintained and remain undeveloped. Failure to maintain 

commonly owned land shall be declared a public nuisance. The City Administrator, or his designee, 

may, after giving proper notice in accordance to procedures established by the Weed Abatement 

Board, cause the necessary work of maintenance or repair and the costs shall be assessed against the 

owner of the PRD common open area i.e., developer, Homeowner’s Association, or owner(s) of the 

PRD. 

 

PRD’s providing two (2) or more attached dwelling units shall provide open space that is adjacent 

and accessible from the units. The minimum open space area shall be three thousand (3,000) square 

feet per dwelling unit. In accordance to Section X Landscape Regulations, a residential buffer shall 

be installed between the multi family units and single-family unit. 

 

V. Architectural Design. 

 

The architectural design of dwellings should create visual variety, as well as promote an integrated 

character for the PRD neighborhood. The objective here is to provide a variety of exterior home 

models that demonstrates neighborhood continuity and avoids monotony. All proposed exterior 

home models (front facades) shall be distinguished with different exterior elevations that meet 

planning commission approval. The planning Commission may require changes in materials, 

building height, building projections into the vertical and horizontal plane, or other front façade 

changes necessary to meet the intent of this section. In no event shall the front façade of a single-

family dwelling be in one (1) continuous vertical or horizontal plane. All home façade models shall 

have a distinctly different front elevation that meet at least two (2) of the criteria below: 

1. Different roof forms/lines/profiles. Example: Roof ridges that change elevations or turn a 

corner or providing front elevation dormers. Roof slope minimum 5:12 pitch. 

2. Different facade compositions consisting of 

a. Different window and door style and placement. Example: Bay or box window minimum 

five (5) feet wide and minimum sixteen (16) inch projection from façade and 

b. Different garage and entryway locations. Example: side or rear loaded garages; 

projecting or recessing entryways from the front elevation. 

3. Different entry treatments and locations. Example: Providing porches, columns. 

4. different number of stories 

A minimum of four (4) different front exterior elevations shall be built on a street with twenty-five 

(25) homes or more. For developments less than twenty-five (25) homes there shall be a minimum 

of three (3) different exterior elevation models. No single family dwelling unit with the same front 

elevation shall be built on adjacent lots, nor shall more than thirty percent (30%) of the same front 

elevation be built on a street. Adjacent lots are any lots that adjoin or share any side lot line or lots 

whose front elevations face each other. Two (2) lots face each other if their front property lines 

overlap. 

 

Note: Changing roof or siding materials and colors, adding garages, providing "mirror images" of 

models, or different elevations of the same model do not constitute different front elevation models. 

Homes within the development should be of similar type and size and be designed so that 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

128 

streetscapes are unified and similar. The architectural appearance of any proposed dwelling shall not 

vary against the appearance of dwellings in an adjacent neighborhood as to cause substantial 

depreciation in the property values within the adjacent neighborhood. 

 

W. Accessory Structures. 

 

Detached accessory structures, customarily used for yard and garden tool storage or a workshop, 

shall conform to the architectural of the primary dwelling and consist of similar materials, form, 

and color of the primary dwelling. Accessory structures shall be architecturally integrated and 

attached to the primary residence and shall. Accessory units shall not be built in any front or side 

yard. Structural improvements allowed in the rear yard shall provide the occupant with useable 

space for recreational purposes. Examples of rear yard improvements that meet the intent of this 

section include swimming pools/spas, patios, and decks.

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007 

132 

A. Continuance of non-conforming land uses and non-conforming structures. 

 

Non-conforming land uses and non-conforming structures are declared by this ordinance to be 

incompatible with permitted uses/conforming structures in the districts in which they are located. 

However, to avoid undue hardship, the lawful use of any structure or land use at the time of the 

enactment of this ordinance may be continued even though such use or structure does not conform 

with the’ provisions of this ordinance except that the non-conforming structure or land use shall not 

be: 

1. Changed to another non-conforming use or allowed use unless such use/structure shall be in 

complete compliance with the regulations (i.e. including parking requirements, landscaping 

requirements; etc.) governing the district’ within which said use/structure is located;* 

2. Reconstructed after removal unless such reconstruction shall in complete compliance with 

the regulations governing the district within which said  

use/structure is located; 

3. Repaired; rebuilt or altered after damage exceeding sixty percent (60%) of its cost at the time 

of destruction. Reconstruction to begin within six (6) months after damage is incurred. The 

provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any, residential unit; 

4. Enlarged or altered in any way which increases or decreases the amount of gross floor area 

of a structure or building unless such use/structure shall be in complete compliance with the 

regulations (i.e. including parking requirements landscaping requirements, etc.) governing 

the district within which said use/structure is located or unless enlargement or alteration is 

required by the’ building codes.* 

5. Established after discontinuance unless such establishment shall be in compliance with all 

regulations governing the district (i.e. parking, landscaping requirements, etc.) within which 

said use/structure is located and any special regulations affecting that use/structure. Failure 

to obtain a business license, or closure for more than twelve (12) consecutive months shall 

constitute discontinuance; but the Board of Adjustment may extend by an additional six (6) 

months if a request is based upon a catastrophic event.  If the actual operation of a legal non-

conforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land ceases for a continuous period of 

twelve (12) months, the legal non-conforming use shall be deemed to be abandoned.  Any 

and all subsequent use of the structure and land shall conform in all respects to the provisions 

of the Zoning Ordinance.  Should the property owner, operator, or any other person dispute 

whether or not the legal non-conforming use has in fact been abandoned, the Board of 

Adjustment shall determine the length of the abandonment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 

if at any time any structure in existence at the time any provision of the Zoning Ordinance 

becomes applicable to it, which does not conform to the Zoning Ordinance be damaged or 

destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God or act of public enemy, the land and structure shall 

be subject to all regulations specified in the section, except that the Board of Adjustment may 

extend the period of non-use from twelve (12) months to eighteen (18) months23.* 

 

*Note: Unless physical constraints (lot size, existing pavement existing: building, etc.) prohibit the 

site from coming into compliance. If physical constraints limit the use/structure from coming into 

compliance, the proposed use must meet the requirements as much as physically possible. A new 

use in an existing building may be exempt from the natural materials exterior requirement of the 

Gateway Ordinance, if it is determined by the Planning Commission that no net improvement will

result from this requirement.  If the developer chooses to change the façade of the building then it 

will need to comply with the exterior materials made to a site on a case-by-case basis (i.e. new paint, 

replacing broken glass, trash removal, landscaping, etc.)  If parking requirements, landscape 

requirements, etc. cannot be met prior to being issued a business license then a bond, letter of credit 

and/or affidavit may be required to ensure that these requirements will be met in a timely fashion.  

The Planning Commission may determine it necessary to re-review a use, after one (1) year or some 

other set period of time.24

fronting on the same street of such lot is less than the minimum required front yard depth. In 

such cases, the minimum front yard shall be the average to the existing front yard depths of 

the existing residences. 

2. In an R-2 zoning district, the maximum building area may be increased by fifteen percent

SECTION 8.24 ADULT BUSINESS REGULATIONS28 

 

A. Purpose and Intent. 

 

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to regulate adult-oriented businesses, which, unless closely 

regulated, tend to have serious secondary effects on the community. The City of Opelika has 

recognized that adult businesses, due to their nature and deleterious secondary effects, can have 

serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to urban blight and 

downgrading the quality of life. The secondary effects on the community include, but are not limited 

to, the following: negative impacts on children, increased crime against women and children, public 

health concerns including sexually transmitted diseases, depreciation of property values and increase 

in vacancies in residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of adult businesses, interference with 

residential property owners' enjoyment of their property when such property is located in the vicinity 

of adult businesses as a result of increases in crime, litter, noise and vandalism, and higher crime 

rates in the vicinity of adult businesses. Special regulations of adult businesses are necessary to 

minimize these adverse effects and the potential degradation of sensitive areas (schools, place of 

worship, etc.) and neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult businesses. 

 

The City of Opelika recognizes the free speech rights of businesses and individual consumers. It is 

neither the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to impose limitations or restrictions on the content 

of any communicative material. It is neither the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to restrict or 

deny access by adults to communication materials or to deny access by the distributors of adult 

businesses to their intended market. However, after considering citizen testimonies and 

recommendations from professional staff concerning the secondary effects of adult businesses on 

the community, the City determined this ordinance is necessary to establish reasonable regulations 

to reduce the secondary effects that adult businesses have upon the residents of the City. 

 

Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or 

maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the 

State of Alabama regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, 

lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. 

 

Section 19 Indecency and Obscenity of the Code of Ordinances, City of Opelika concerning 

indecency, obscenity, and related offences prohibits the following: 

• It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to show any obscene29 materials or exhibits to 

minors or have obscene a performance with knowledge a minor is present (minor - any 

unmarried person under the age of eighteen years).

politic or scientific value. (Section 19-531, Code of Ordinances, City of Opelika)

SECTION 8.25 RESIDENTIAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 

 

The City of Opelika seeks to encourage the redevelopment of residential neighborhoods that are

SECTION 8.28 STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC LAND USES 

 

SECTION 8.28.1 SMALL BOX DISCOUNT STORE36 

 
A. Purpose and Intent 

The purpose and intent of this section is to regulate the continued growth and development of 

small box discount stores, promotes greater diversity of retail options and convenient access to 

fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy foods.  The number of small box discount stores have 

increased over the last decade.  Many of these stores are in close proximity to each other.   While it 

is recognized that small box discount stores may be the only convenient source of some food items 

for people in areas underserved by traditional grocery stores, it is also recognized that small box 

discount stores offer limited healthy fresh food options, especially when it comes to fresh fruits 

and vegetables and fresh or frozen meats.   A good mix of food retail has the potential to revitalize 

neighborhoods and commercial centers and improve access to a healthy diet, particularly for 

populations in underserved areas. 

Most of these stores are located in areas classified by the United States Department of Agriculture 

as food deserts.  The City of Opelika desires to continue to allow the presence of small box 

discount stores, but it is also necessary to regulate them and to encourage stores to offer more 

healthy fresh food options.  These regulations will promote the efficient use of land and resources 

in the City of Opelika, AL, and are necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the 

citizens of Opelika.  The City of Opelika will accomplish this by assessing the food retail 

environment based upon an evaluation of the subject retail landscape at the time of a zoning 

application 

B. Use Standards and Dispersal Requirements 

1) Small box discount stores are prohibited unless the proposed use is located more than 5,280 

feet from another small box discount store, within or outside the City of Opelika corporate 

boundaries. The separation distances shall be measured in a straight line from property line 

of the proposed small box discount store to the property line of the existing small box

Section 9.5. General Provisions for Signs 

The following general sign provisions shall apply to this section and to all lawful 

conforming and nonconforming signs, unless otherwise indicated. 

(1) Measurement of Sign Area  
The area of a sign is measured or calculated as follows: 

a. Background panel signs. Sign copy that is mounted, affixed, or painted on a 

background panel or area distinctively painted, textured or constructed as a 

background for the sign copy, is measured as that area contained within the 

sum of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles or 

ellipses, or combination thereof, that will enclose both the sign copy and the 

background. See Figure A and Figure B.

Figure A: Illustration of sign area calculation for a monument sign with copy on a distinct cabinet. 

 

 
Figure B: Illustration of computing the sign area for wall signs with a background panel or cabinet. 

b. Background surface signs. The area of a sign consisting of copy mounted as 

individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia, or parapet of a building 

surface or another surface, that has not been painted, textured, or otherwise 

altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as 

the sum of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles 

or ellipses that will enclose each word, graphic or discrete visual element in 

the total sign. See Figure C.

164 

 

  
Figure C: Illustration of sign area calculation for a wall sign with individual letters. 

c. The area of a sign with copy mounted, affixed, or painted on an illuminated 

surface or illuminated element or a building or structure, is measured as the 

entire illuminated surface or illuminated element which contains sign copy. 

d. If a sign has two display faces, and the perimeter of both faces coincide, are 

parallel, and are not more than twenty-four (24) inches apart, then the sign 

area is measured by one sign face only Otherwise, the sign faces are 

considered to be separate signs and sign faces and subject to any and all 

applicable restrictions. 

e. If a sign has three or more faces, then the sign area is equal to fifty percent 

(50%) percent of the aggregate area of all sign faces. The area of each face 

shall be determined according to Paragraphs Section 9.5(1)a and Section 

9.5(1)b, as applicable. 

f. When a sign is in the form of a three-dimensional object, the area shall be 

determined by drawing a square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination 

thereof, which will encompass the projected image of the sign and 

multiplying that area by two (2). The “projected image” is that image 

created by tracing the largest possible two-dimensional outline of the sign. 

(2) Measurement of Sign Height 

a. The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance 

from the finished grade of the ground below the sign excluding any filling, 

berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purposes of increasing the 

height of the sign, to the top edge of the highest portion of the sign. The 

maximum height allowed for a freestanding sign, however, shall not include 

any architectural embellishment provided the embellishment does not 

contain any sign copy and does not exceed thirty-six (36) inches below the 

sign copy and eighteen (18) inches above the sign copy. 

b. The filling of a pre-existing hole or depression to create an average grade at 

the same level as that surrounding the hole or depression is permitted, 

provided such filling is allowed by other ordinances. 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section IX: Sign Regulations Date of Amend: November 16, 2021  Ord. No 025- 

165 

 

c. In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign height 

shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade 

at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the 

crown of a public or private street. See Figure D. 

 
Figure D: Illustration of the measurement of sign height when the grade at the bottom of the sign is below the grade of the 

adjacent street. 

d. Where a distance is established for the clearance of a sign, such 

measurements shall be made from the normal grade of the ground, directly 

under the applicable sign or structure supporting the sign, and the bottom 

most point of the sign or the structure supporting the sign, whichever is 

closest. 

(3) Façade or Building Unit Measurements 
When calculating the permitted sign area based on the width of any façade, such calculation shall 

be based on viewing the façade from a 90-degree angle (i.e., straight on) from the adjacent street, 

regardless of façade insets, offsets or angles. See Figure E. 

 
Figure E: Illustration of façade width measurement on varied façade shapes. 

(4) Signs in Overlay Districts 
Unless otherwise specified, where there is an overlay zoning district, the base zoning district shall 

control the signage allowed on any given parcel.

a. A permanent sign located on a parcel with a residential use in any zoning 

district may not be separately or specially illuminated, unless otherwise 

specified in this Section IX. 

b. A permanent sign on a parcel with a nonresidential use may only be 

illuminated by internal illumination, internal indirect (halo) illumination, or 

lit by external indirect illumination, unless otherwise specified in this 

section. However, a permanent sign may not be illuminated in a manner that 

leaves the illumination device exposed to public view except with the use of 

neon tubing as provided in Section 9.5(5)i. 

c. Outdoor internally illuminated signs, including but not limited to awning 

signs, canopy signs, cabinet signs (whether freestanding or attached), or 

changeable copy signs, shall be constructed with an opaque background and 

translucent sign copy elements, or with a colored background and sign copy 

elements. 

d. Externally lit signs are permitted to be illuminated only with steady, 

stationary, down directed and shielded light sources directed solely onto the 

sign. Light bulbs or tubes (excluding neon), used for illuminating a sign, 

shall not be visible from the adjacent public rights-of-way or residential 

properties. 

e. No sign located within fifty (50) feet of a property with a single-family use 

or zoned for a single-family use shall be internally illuminated. 

f. Any portion of the sign face or sign structure that is illuminated shall count 

against the total square footage of sign area allowed. 

g. Artificial light used in conjunction with the lighting of any sign shall not be 

directed or reflected onto any structure or constitute a hazard to the safe and 

efficient operation of vehicles upon a street or highway. 

h. Brightness Levels of Electronic Message Signs 

(i) Illumination levels shall be measured in foot-candles with a foot-candle meter sensor 

in a horizontal position at an approximate height of three feet above grade.  

(ii) Illumination of electronic message signs shall not exceed 0.3 footcandles over 

ambient lighting conditions when measured at 50 feet in any direction from an 

electronic message sign. 

(iii) Audio emissions from electronic message signs shall be prohibited. 

(iv) Electronic message signs shall be equipped with manual diming or scheduled 

dimming controls, or photocell/light sensors that automatically dims the brightness 

of the sign as ambient conditions change.  

(v) Prior to issuance of a sign permit for any electronic message sign, the applicant shall 

provide a written certification from the sign company or sign manufacturer that 

brightness levels will not exceed the ambient light conditions specified herein.

provided the measured area of any such projection or detailed embellishment does 

not exceed twelve (12) square feet in area, or twenty-five percent (25%) of the sign 

area, whichever is greater. If neon embellishments exceed these limits, then the 

embellishments shall be included and counted as part of the permitted sign area for 

the use. 

(iii) Devices that illuminate a sign or signs shall be placed and shielded so that the direct 

light rays reflecting from such devices or from the sign itself shall not be cast into 

the eyes of any passing motorist.

(6) Before issuance of a sign permit, the Planning Director shall collect the necessary 

sign permit fees. The sign permit fees shall be as designated by resolution or 

ordinance of the City Council. 

(7) The Planning Director may make or require any inspections to ascertain compliance 

with the provisions of this Section IX and the Zoning Ordinance. 

(8) Revocation of sign permit.  If the work under any sign permit is proceeding in 

violation of this Section IX, the Zoning Ordinance, or the Building Code, or should 

it be found that there has been any false statement or misrepresentation of a material 

fact in the application or plans on which the sign permit was based, the permit holder 

shall be notified of the violation. If the permit holder fails or refuses to make 

corrections within ten (10) calendar days, it shall be the duty of the Planning 

Director to revoke such sign permit and serve notice upon such permit holder. Such 

notice shall be in writing and signed by the Planning Director. It shall be unlawful 

for any person to proceed with any part of work after such notice is issued. 

Section 9.11. Nonconforming Signs 

 All signs that are lawfully in existence or are lawfully erected and that do not conform to 

the provisions of this Section IX or the Zoning Ordinance are declared nonconforming signs. It is 

the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination of nonconforming signs as 

expeditiously and fairly as possible is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the 

prohibition of new signs that would violate the provisions of this section. It is also the intent of 

this section that any elimination of nonconforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any 

unreasonable invasion of established property rights. 

(1) Legal Nonconforming Signs: 

a. A legal nonconforming sign is a sign that lawfully existed at the time of the 

enactment of this section that does not conform to the regulations as 

specified in this section. 

b. A legal nonconforming sign may continue to be utilized only in the manner 

and to the extent that it existed at the time of the adoption of this section or 

any amendment thereof.

c. A legal nonconforming sign may continue in the manner and to the extent 

that it existed at the time of the adoption and shall not be altered in any 

manner not in conformance with this section. This does not apply to 

reasonable repair and maintenance of the sign or to a change of copy 

provided that by changing the copy structural alterations are not required. 

d. Legal nonconforming signs that are located on a parcel of property that is 

severed from a larger parcel of property and acquired by a public entity for 

public use by condemnation, purchase or dedication may be relocated on the 

remaining parcel without extinguishing the legal nonconforming status of 

that sign provided that the nonconforming sign: 

(i) Is not increased in area or height to exceed the limits of the zoning district in which it 

is located; 

(ii) Remains structurally unchanged except for reasonable repairs or alterations; 

(iii) Is placed in the most similar position on the remaining property that it occupied prior 

to the relocation; and 

(iv) Is relocated in a manner so as to comply with all applicable safety requirements. 

After relocation pursuant to this subsection, the legal nonconforming sign shall be subject to 

all provisions of this section in its new location. 

e. A new sign shall not be installed on a lot where a nonconforming sign exists 

until all signs on the lot conforms to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.  

f. A nonconforming sign shall lose it legal nonconforming status and have to 

be removed entirely or replaced by a conforming sign if: 

(i) If such sign is damaged to an amount exceeding 50 percent of the sign’s replacement 

value; 

(ii) The structure of the sign is altered in any form; 

(iii) The sign is relocated unless as specifically authorized by this Section 9.11; 

(iv) The sign is defined as a temporary sign and has been in use for more than one year 

following the effective date of this amendment; or 

(v) The nonconforming sign and its structure (including support and frame and panel) 

are determined by the building official, or their designee, to be unsafe or in violation 

of this code and are declared a nuisance. 

g. All existing portable signs still located in any zoning district shall be 

considered nonconforming and shall be removed unless permitted herein. 

(2) Illegal Signs 
Any sign that was not specifically allowed or that did not comply with any previous version of the 

Zoning Ordinance is illegal if the same was relocated, enlarged, structurally altered or extended 

prior to the effective date of this Section IX unless the same had been made to conform to all the 

provisions of the Zoning Code prior to the effective date of this Section IX or unless the same 

received any vested right through a settlement agreement.

188 

 

(3) Signs for a Legal Nonconforming Use: 
New or additional signs for a nonconforming use shall only be permitted if the proposed signs 

conform to the sign standards for the applicable district. 

Section 9.12. Miscellaneous Provisions 

For a sign requiring a sign permit, weeds and grass, all foliage shall be kept cut in front of, behind, 

underneath, and from around the base of the sign for a minimum distance of ten (10) feet from the

Any such sign shall be removed or repaired by the owner of the sign or the owner of 

the premises, or as otherwise provided in this Section IX. 

(3) Each sign installed, created, erected or maintained in violation of this Section IX 

shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty portions herein.  

(4) Any violation of this Section IX is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.  

(5) Both the owners or other persons in charge or control of the sign and owners or other 

persons in charge or control of the property on which the sign is located are 

responsible for assuring compliance with Section IX. Any failure or refusal to 

comply with Section IX shall be in violation and punished as herein provided. 

(6) Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this Section IX 

shall, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $200.00 plus costs of court. Each 

day that such a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.  

(7) The City, as an additional or alternative remedy, may institute injunctive, 

mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent 

jurisdiction to prevent, remove, repair, abate or correct any violation of this Section 

IX.  

Section 9.14. Removal of Unlawful and Dangerous Signs

SECTION X 

 

LANDSCAPE REGULATIONS 

 

 

SECTION 10.1 PURPOSE 

 

The following landscape regulations are for the purpose of protecting and enhancing the ecological 

and esthetic environments of the City of Opelika and to implement the goals contained in the City's 

Comprehensive Plan. Proper landscaping benefits the City by reducing soil erosion and storm 

water runoff, glare from vehicles, wind, heat, noise, dust, and other offensive conditions. 

Furthermore, landscaping buffers and screens incompatible land uses, maintains and enhances the 

character of neighborhoods, serves to attract potential residents and developers to the City, and 

generally creates a safer, more attractive and more pleasant living and working environment for 

all residents of the City of Opelika. 

 

 

SECTION 10.2 DEFINITIONS 

 

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in the Section, shall have the meaning ascribed 

to them in this section, except when the context clearly requires otherwise: 

 

Caliper:   Diameter of a tree trunk. Caliper is used for trees less than 

12" in diameter.   For trees less than 4" in diameter it is 

measured 6 inches from the ground. For trees between 4" and 

12" diameter it is measured 12" from the ground. 

  

City Horticulturist:   Refers to the City of Opelika Grounds keeping 

Superintendent or designated authority. 

 

D.B.H:   Diameter at breast height. D.B.H. is used for trees with a 

diameter greater than 12” and is measured four (4) feet above 

the ground. 

 

Developed Area:   All land area disturbed for the purpose of developing 

structures, parking facilities, landscaped areas, etc. 

 

Developer:   The legal or beneficial owner of a lot or parcel or any land 

proposed for development and/or inclusion in a 

development, including the owner of an option, contract to 

purchase, or lease. 

  

Groundcover:   An evergreen or deciduous planting less than 24" in height, 

turf grass is excluded. 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991 

191 

 

Mono-culture:   A single type and species of planting. This type of planting 

is prohibited by this code. 

 

Mulch:   A natural planting material such as pine straw or tree bark 

used to control weed growth, reduce soil erosion and reduce 

water loss. 

 

Parking Lot Planting:   A planting required due to the construction of non-covered 

parking. When less than 25 parking spaces are proposed, 

these plantings may be spaced around the perimeter of the 

parking lot. When more than 25 spaces are proposed, these 

plantings shall be placed within "parking lot islands" and/or 

"parallel planting peninsulas." 

 

Parking Lot Island:   A planting island contained completely within the confines 

of a parking facility. These islands shall be elevated at least 

four (4) inches in height and bordered by concrete curbing. 

These are ideal places for required parking lot plantings (see 

Appendix). 

 

Parallel Planting Peninsula:   A planting island that extends out into the parking area, and 

is bounded on at least one (1) side by the outer edge of the 

asphalt or building. These shall be elevated at least four (4) 

inches in height and bordered by concrete curbing. These are 

ideal places for required parking lot plantings (see 

Appendix). 

 

Recommended Tree:   Any one (1) of the trees listed under "Section 10.9 

Recommended Trees." These trees are well suited for the 

soils-and climate of Opelika, Alabama.

192 

 

SECTION 10.3 APPLICABILITY 

 

All rules, regulations, conditions, and requirements set forth in this Section are applicable as 

follows: 

 

A. Any new development or construction in a C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2, I-1, and PUD zoning 

district. Multi-family developments (buildings composed of three (3) or more dwelling 

units) in any zoning district which require review by City of Opelika staff are also subject 

to these regulations. 

 

B. An alteration to an existing building(s), development(s), or construction which increases 

or decreases the amount of gross floor area of a structure or building on a lot by more than 

fifty (50) percent. The property, which undergoes such alteration, shall be required to come 

into compliance with all landscaping requirements in place at that time. 

 

C. Nothing herein shall affect in any way the rights of, or exercise by, any public utility of its 

present and future acquired rights, to clear trees and other growth from lands used by the 

public utility. The utility shall cooperate and coordinate with the City Horticulturist when 

clearing or pruning of the rights-of-way. 

 

D. Nothing herein shall reduce the lines of sight and traffic visibility standards adopted by the 

City in the Opelika Public Works Manual. Due consideration should be given to plantings 

within twenty (20) feet of an intersection along a roadway. In such cases certain height 

provisions of this code may be modified by the City Engineer. 

 

 

SECTION 10.4 GENERAL INFORMATION 

 

A. Trees Located Within the Right-of-Way. 

1. Trees located within a local right-of-way are property of the City of Opelika. The removal 

of significant trees within the right-of-way is prohibited without written permission of the 

City Horticulturist. 

2. Any "significant tree" located within a public right-of-way and abutting the subject 

property shall be shown on the Landscape Plan. "Significant trees" within the right-of-way 

and abutting the subject property may-be applied toward existing tree credits with approval 

from the City Horticulturist. 

3. Any "significant tree" located within a right-of-way that is damaged by a developer, such 

as because of construction, shall be immediately removed and replaced by the developer. 

The replacement shall be a similar planting with a caliper of at least 2.5". 

4. All care of any "significant tree" within the right-of-way applied towards existing tree 

credits shall become the responsibility of the property owner. This includes limb pruning, 

tree removal, etc. 

  



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991 

193 

 

B. Size and Quality Requirements. 

1. Any Large Tree planted to meet requirements of this Section shall have at least 2"-2.5" 

caliper. Any Medium Tree or Understory Tree planted to meet requirements of this 

Ordinance shall have a caliper between 1.25" and 1.5", except that multi-stemmed 

Understory Trees shall be between six (6) and eight (8) feet in height. In addition, 

deviations from the "Recommended Tree List" may be approved through a written request 

to the City Horticulturist. These plantings may or may not count towards the point total for 

the property. 

2. Tree(s) shall be in a healthy condition at the time of planting. 

3. Shrubs planted to meet requirements of this Ordinance shall be at least 24" in height. 

4. Grass shall completely cover the soil after one (1) full growing season. 

5. No bare ground shall be left exposed. Grass and other approved appropriate groundcover 

or mulch; such as pine straw or tree-bark, shall cover all non-paved and non-built 

"developed areas." 

6. Irrigation is not required but is highly recommended. Proper irrigation greatly improves 

the chances for survival. 

7. Any planting that dies shall be replaced. 

 

C.  Basic Landscaping Requirements.

Article II.  

SECTION 10.6 LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS 

 

A. Steps for Approval. 

 

Step 1 Determine the number of base points required via shade trees, shrubbery or a 

combination thereof; [see Section 10.6(B)] 

 

Step 2 Determine the number of Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs which must be planted. The 

quantity of plants required is based on the number of parking spaces proposed; [see 

Section 10.6(C)] 

 

Step 3 Determine whether Residential and/or Parking Lot Buffers apply to the 

development; [see Section 10.6(D)] 

 

Step 4 Develop a Landscape Plan with plantings in sufficient numbers to meet the 

 point requirements and with any applicable buffer. [See Section 10.5(A)] 

 

B. Shade Planting Requirements/Point System. 

 

Each developed area must equal or exceed a minimum number of "base points" in order to obtain 

approval. The number of points required depends on the size of the developed area (see Table 1). 

Different types of plantings are worth different points; Large Trees are worth eleven (11) points, 

Medium Trees are worth eight (8) points, Understory Trees are worth five (5) points, and 

Shrubs/groundcovers are worth one (1) point (see Table 2). 

 

The developer may use any combination of plantings to obtain the necessary number of points. 

Different lots and landscapes will lend themselves to different types of plantings. This Ordinance 

attempts to encourage creativity and diversity in landscaping. In no cases, however, shall a 

mono-culture of plantings be allowed. A variation of plantings, at least three (3) different species, 

is required. 

 

In order to obtain points, the plantings must be placed on the developing property and not on a 

public right-of-way. 

 

Number of Points Required for the Site 

Table 1 

 

Square Footage of the Developed Area* Number of Points Required 

         0-10,000 40 (+l per parking space) 

10,001-20,000  60 (+1 per parking space) 

20,001-30,000  80 (+1 per parking space) 

30,001-40,000 100 (+1 per parking space) 

40,001-50,000 120 (+1 per parking space) 

50,001-60,000 140 (+1 per parking space) 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991 

195 

 

* When only small portions of large lots are developed, (e.g. only one (1) acre of a ten acre lot) 

only the immediate construction area shall be considered when determining the number of points 

required. Contact the Planning Department to determine the immediate construction area. 

 

Alternative formula for determining number of points required for sites greater than 60,000 square 

feet: 

 

Base points= [(X - 10,000)/500] + 40  {X=Construction Area} 
 

Parking lot points= 1 per parking space

• See Section 10.9 Recommended Tree List 

 

C. Parking Lot Requirements. 

 

All non-covered, street-level parking facilities established and governed by this Section shall be 

landscaped in accordance with the following requirements: 

1. In addition to the number of "base points" required with shade plantings, one (1) 

additional, point is added to the site for each parking space proposed. These points must 

be used to plant "Parking Lot Trees and/or Parking Lot Shrubs." (E.g. a 26,000 square 

foot lot requires 80 base points; however, it also has 15 parking spaces. The additional 

15 points brings the lot up to 95 points, with 15 of those points designated as Parking 

Lot Trees and/or shrubs.) 

2. On parking lots with less than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, "Parking Lot 

Trees/Shrubs" may be spaced around the lot as desired to provide a uniform and 

attractive design. 

3. On lots with more than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, "Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs" 

shall be planted on "parking lot island(s)" and/or "parallel planting peninsulas" within 

the confines of the established parking lot. These plantings will minimize and break the 

expanse of asphalt and concrete. Acceptable islands and parallel planting peninsulas 

are displayed in Figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix. 

4. Each "parking lot island" or "parallel planting peninsula" shall have at least one (1) 

tree. 

  



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991 

196 

 

D. Buffers and Buffer Zones. 

 

In addition to the required number of points above, a parcel may be required to buffer certain 

portions of the property. 

 

Trees from the "Recommended Tree List" planted to meet either Residential or Parking Lot buffer 

requirements, may be applied toward the point requirements. Shrubs may not be applied toward 

the point requirements. This provision allows credit for plantings in the buffer area(s); however, it 

prevents a property from planting only in those areas. 

 

In cases where a parking area abuts a residential zone, then the more stringent "Residential Zone 

Buffer" requirements supersede the parking lot buffer. 

 

1. Residential Zone Buffer (see diagrams). 

On any commercial, industrial, institutional, PUD or multi-family development, except 

duplexes, adjacent to or abutting a residential zoning district, a buffer strip along the 

property line(s) of the developing property is required. 

The buffer shall run the entire length of the abutting lot line(s). The type of buffer may 

consist of any or all of the following: (see Residential Buffer Options in the Appendix) 

a. An opaque fence not less than six (6) feet in height, with horizontal or vertical 

openings not greater than three (3) inches per one (1) linear foot AND a four (4) foot 

wide strip of Evergreen plantings, which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height 

within three full growing seasons planted on the inside of the fence or; 

b. A staggered double row of Evergreen plantings at least six (6) feet in 

width, which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height and spaced in a manner which 

after three (3) years will provide an impervious visual barrier or; 

c. Natural, undisturbed forest at least twenty (20) feet in width that provides a 

nearly impervious visual barrier due to the dense nature of the plants and/or trees. If 

this option is chosen, the City Horticulturist shall determine whether the barrier is 

satisfactory through a site inspection prior to plan approval. Barriers shall be erected 

during construction to ensure the area is protected from damage due to construction. 

 

2. Parking Lot Buffer:  Asphalt closer than ten (10) feet to any property line shall be buffered 

with one of the following types of buffers: 

a. A planting strip of no less than four (4) feet in width shall be provided between said 

property line and the off-street parking facilities (asphalt). A planting screen or hedge, 

of developers choice, and between two (2) and four (4) feet in height shall be provided 

and maintained on a continuing basis, except that such screen or hedge shall not 

obstruct or obscure sight lines, restrict vehicular movement, or block pedestrian 

walkways or sidewalks and/or, 

b. A six (6) foot wide single row of understory, medium, or large trees located between 

said property line and the off-street parking facilities (asphalt). The trees shall be 

spaced in a ratio of one (1) understory tree every fifteen (15) feet, or one (1) medium 

tree every thirty (30) feet, or one (1) large tree every forty-five (45) feet. Shrubbery 

shall be provided between the plantings. 



 

Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991 

197 

 

The shrubs/trees shall be maintained on a continuing basis, except that such plantings 

shall not obstruct or obscure sight lines, restrict vehicular movement, or block 

pedestrian walkways or sidewalks. The trees may be applied toward the base point 

requirement; however, the shrubs may not be applied. 

 

 

SECTION 10.7 EXISTING TREE CREDITS 

 

In order to encourage the preservation of Opelika's older trees, certain requirements relating to the 

number and density of new trees may be waived in the event existing trees are preserved. 

 

A. For each existing "Significant Tree" with a D.B.H. between six (6) inches and ten (10) 

inches, fifteen (15) fewer points are required. For each existing "Significant Tree" between 

I l" and twenty-four (24) inches, twenty (20) fewer points are required. For each existing 

"Significant Tree" with a D.B.H. over twenty-four (24) inches, twenty-five (25) fewer 

points are required. However, precautions must be taken during construction to prevent 

damage to the existing tree(s), and any tree that dies during or because of construction must 

be replaced with a similar species or species approved by the City Horticulturist to equal 

lost tree points. (e.g. An Oak with a D.B.H. of twenty-five (25) inches is claimed as an 

existing tree, but subsequently dies. The developer must replace the tree with tree plantings 

which exceed 25 points). 
 

B. Trees for which an owner/developer wishes to receive credit must be in the developed area 

and cannot be in undeveloped portions of the parcel. This stipulation prevents a developer 

with a large tract of land from claiming credit on portions left undeveloped and thus 

eliminating landscaping on the developed portion of the parcel. 
 

 

SECTION 10.8 MAINTENANCE 

 

The owner is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of planted trees in perpetuity within 

his/her development. After all plantings are finalized, the developer will schedule an inspection of 

the plantings with the City Horticulturist and landscape installer. If all plantings appear to be in
