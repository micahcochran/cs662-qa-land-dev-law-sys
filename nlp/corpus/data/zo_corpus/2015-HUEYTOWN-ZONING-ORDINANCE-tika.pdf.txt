therein, is hereby made a part of this ordinance. 

(b)  The official zoning map shall be drawn on durable transparent material from which prints can be made and 
shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator. 

(c)  The Zoning Administrator shall update the official zoning map within thirty days after amendments to it are 
adopted by the City Council. 



 

8 

 

(d)  Should the official zoning map or any portion be lost, destroyed, damaged, or difficult to interpret because 
of the nature or number of revisions, the Zoning Administrator shall have a new map drawn and adopted by 
resolution of the City Council. Any map amendment shall follow rezoning amendment procedures 
contained in this ordinance. 

Sec. 22. Zoning district boundaries. 

The rules of this section shall be used to determine the precise locations of any district boundary shown on the 
Hueytown Zoning Map. 

(1)  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following any jurisdictional limits shall be construed as 
following such limits. 

(2)  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets, alleys, or rights-of-way shall be 
construed as following such streets, alleys, or rights-of-way 

(3)  Boundary lines, which follow or approximately follow platted lot lines or other property lines as shown on 
the Jefferson County Tax Maps shall be construed as following such lines. 

(4)  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to lie midway 
between the main tracks of such railroad lines. 

(5)  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following shorelines of any lakes or ponds shall be 
construed to follow the mean high waterlines of such lakes or ponds. In the event of a change in the mean 
high waterline, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the actual mean high waterline. 

(6) Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, or other 
continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following the channel of such water courses taken 
at mean low water. In the event of a natural change in the location of such streams, rivers, or other water 
courses, the district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. 

(7)  Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to any of the features listed in 
paragraphs (1) through (6) above shall be construed to be parallel to such features. In the absence of 
specific dimensions, the scale of the map shall determine the distance from such features. 

Sec. 23. District use regulations. 

Unless otherwise provided, no building, structure, or land shall be used except in the zoning districts indicated by 
this article and according to the additional regulations of this ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances. 

Sec. 24. Use limitations due to zoning standards. 

Although a use may be permitted according to specified procedures in a particular district, such use may not 
necessarily be permitted on every parcel of land in the district.   A use may be permitted only if it can meet all of the 
standards of this ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances. 

Sec. 25. Combined principal and accessory uses. 

(a)  Unless otherwise prevented by this ordinance, more than one permitted principal use may be combined on a 
lot if all of the combined uses are commonly associated with and integrally related to one another. Further, 
all zoning regulations for each of the combined uses shall be met. 

(b)  Whenever an activity, which may or may not be separately listed in the district is conducted in conjunction 
with a permitted use in the district as an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity on a lot, the 



 

9 

 

incidental activity shall be permitted as an accessory use if the combined uses are commonly associated 
with and integrally related to one another. 

(c)  For the purpose of this section commonly associated means that the association of such combined uses 
takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common community acceptance of their relatedness. 

Sec. 26. Interpretation of uses. 

This ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings given the infinite variations of essentially similar 
uses.  Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to make interpretations so as to classify any questioned 
use within a listed use of most similar impact and characteristics. However, in no case shall the Zoning 
Administrator interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in question is more similar in impact and 
characteristics to another listed use. Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's use interpretation may be filed with the 
Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

Sec. 27. Unclassified uses. 

In the event the Zoning Administrator finds a new or unusual use that cannot appropriately fit a listed use in any 
district, the following procedures shall be followed: 

(1)  If compatible with the existing zoning district intent, the unclassified use shall be permitted by special 
exception upon approval and subject to the conditions set by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(2)  If the unclassified use would not be compatible with the intent of the existing zoning district intent, the 
Zoning Administrator shall determine the most appropriate district classification and require the property in 
question to be rezoned.   In addition, the unclassified use shall be permitted in the new district by special 
exception if granted approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(3)  Following the final action on the unclassified use, as (1) or (2) above may require, the Planning 
Commission shall initiate an amendment to this ordinance to list the newly permitted use into the most 
appropriate district(s).

Division 6. Special Purpose Districts  

Sec. 80. PUD Planned Unit Development District. 

(a)  PUD District intent. This District permits a tract to be planned and developed as an integral unit under single 
ownership or control, consisting of a combination of residential and non-residential uses. The District intent is 
to provide a living, working, and shopping environment within the development that contributes to a sense of 
community and a coherent living style. Further, the District seeks to provide a development framework that 
obtains commercial and industrial business activity that significantly improves the economic development of 
the community; to encourages the preservation and enhancement of the natural amenities of land and protect 
natural features; and to reduce improvement costs through more efficient arrangement of varied land uses, 
buildings, circulation systems, and infrastructure. 

(b)  PUD approval process.  Approval of a PUD requires a three step approval process, as follows: 

(1)  Rezoning and concept plan approval. A concept plan shall accompany each application for rezoning to the 
PUD District. Development of the PUD shall be in substantial accord with the approved concept plan. The 
concept plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a professional engineer, land surveyor, 
architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Alabama.  The concept plan shall show, 
in schematic detail, the concept for use and development of the entire PUD tract. 

(2)  Preliminary site plan approval.   Following rezoning and concept plan approval, the developer shall submit 
a preliminary site plan to the Planning Commission for each phase of the development in substantial accord 
with the concept plan. The preliminary site plan shall be drawn to scale and dimensioned, prepared by a 
professional engineer, land surveyor, architect, or landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of 
Alabama. The preliminary plan shall show information necessary for the Planning Commission to 
adequately assess the suitability of the proposed development, including at a minimum the following items: 
the location of proposed uses; proposed building areas and heights; proposed residential development 
density; housing types; lots with proposed sizes, widths, and yards; proposed screening and buffer yards, 
proposed off-street parking and loading areas; layout of streets; pedestrian facilities, and drives; location of 
all entrances to the tract; and layout and configuration of common open space. Also, a narrative text and 
supplemental drawings shall accompany the preliminary site plan, describing the general design and 
construction policies for the PUD, the proposed design and construction standards for streets; the treatment 
of environmentally-sensitive land located in the project tract (areas of flooding, severe slope, woodlands, 
streams, lakes, and ponds); the proposed time frame for phased development; and such other conditions for 
use and development proposed by the applicant. All preliminary site plans shall be in substantial accord 
with the approved concept plan. Any deviation in the preliminary site plan from the approved concept plan 
shall require re-submittal of the PUD rezoning and concept plan approval application. 

(3)  Final site plan approval. Before each phase of the development is constructed, a final site plan shall be 
required, in accordance with § 314. Site plan review. Final site plan approval shall be coordinated with the 
approval of subdivision plats and construction plans required by the Hueytown Subdivision Regulations.   
All final site plans shall be in substantial accord with the approved preliminary site plan. Any deviation in 
the final site plan from the approved preliminary site plan shall require re-submittal of the preliminary site 
plan application. 

(c)  PUD District use regulations. A Planned Unit Development District may be established for any tract. The 
Planned Unit Development (referred to as PUD) shall consist of a combination of uses planned and developed 
as an integral unit under single ownership or control.  Specific use limitations shall be established in the process 
of plan approval. 

(d)  PUD District dimensional regulations. In any PUD, the developer may create lots and construct buildings 
without regard to the conventional minimum lot size, lot width, or yard restrictions of this ordinance except 
that: 



 

43 

 

(1)  A 50 feet lot boundary setback shall apply where and to the extent that the development abuts land that is 
not part of the PUD, and 

(2)  Each lot must be of sufficient size and dimensions that it can support the structure proposed to be located 
on it, consistent with all other applicable requirements of this ordinance, as approved by the Planning 
Commission in the preliminary and final site plans. 

(e)  PUD District design and construction standards. Where the design and construction standards approved in the 
preliminary and final site plans conflict with the subdivision regulations and any other requirements of this 
zoning ordinance, the standards approved in the PUD approval process shall control. 

(f)  Issuance of permits within a PUD subdivision. Permits may be issued in any phase of a PUD subdivision with 
public improvements under construction following completion of final site plan and subdivision plat approval, 
provided: 

(1)  No building permits for a subdivision with public improvements under construction shall be issued by the 
Building Inspector unless the extent of street improvements is adequate for vehicular access by the 
prospective builder and by police and fire equipment. Further, no building permit shall be issued for the 
greater of two or the final 10% of lots within the subdivision until all public improvements and dedications 
have been completed by the developer and accepted by the City. 

(2)  No certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued by the Building Inspector 
prior to the completion and dedication of required public improvements and posting of a maintenance bond 
for public improvements.

(1)  On the effective date of annexation all newly-annexed property shall be zoned MR Municipal Reserve 
District. 

(2)  At its next meeting following the Council's adoption of the annexation, the Planning Commission shall 
initiate a petition to rezone property from the MR District to any other district contained within this 
ordinance. In determining the most appropriate zone, the Planning Commission shall duly consider the 
following items, among others: 

a.  Comprehensive land use studies/plan; 

b.  The desires of the property owners subject to rezoning; 

c.  The State-mandated purposes and considerations of zoning, as set forth in section 11-52-72, Code of 
Alabama, 1975, as amended. 

(3)  All uses in existence at the time of annexation may lawfully continue under the provisions of the MR 
District, in accord with the E-l District standards.

public and private losses due to flood conditions. 

(b)  Overlay district concept.   The provisions of this district shall be overlay provisions to the existing underlying 
zoning districts. All properties within the district shall be designated by the F suffix added to the underlying 
district prefix, i.e., R-1F. As overlay provisions, the requirements of this district shall serve as a supplement to 
the underlying zoning district provisions. Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions of this 
overlay district and the provisions of the underlying district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 

(c)  Compliance with Flood Hazard District regulations. 

(1)  No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, enlarged, 
converted, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms of this district and other 
applicable regulations. 

(2)  The provisions of this district are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, 
covenants, or deed restrictions.   However, where these provisions and another conflict or overlap, 
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 

(3)  The provisions of this district supersede any regulations currently in effect in flood-prone areas. However, 
any underlying regulations shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more 
restrictive. 

(d)  Flood hazard terms defined. The following flood hazard terms when used in this district shall have the 
meanings defined by this subsection: 

base flood or 100 year flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given 
year. 

development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to 
buildings or other structures, the placement of manufactured homes, streets and other paving, utilities, 
filling, grading, excavation, mining, dredging, or drilling operations. 

flood or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land 
areas during the 100 year base flood. 

floodplain. A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream, or watercourse which is subject to partial 
or complete inundation during the 100 year base flood; an area subject to the unusual and rapid 
accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source during the base flood. 

floodway. The designated area of the floodplain required to carry and discharge flood waters of a given 
magnitude during the base flood. 

floodway fringe. That area of the floodplain not included in the floodway. 

lowest floor. Includes the lowest enclosed area of a structure (including basement). An unfinished or flood 
resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a 
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to 
render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this district. 

mean sea level. The National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum used as a reference for 
establishing various elevations within the floodplain. 



 

46 

 

manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis 
and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. 
The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater 
than 180 consecutive days. 

manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more 
manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 

start of construction (includes substantial improvement).   The date the building permit was issued, provided 
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit 
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, 
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work 
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent 
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the 
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or 
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of 
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main 
structure. 

structure. Anything constructed or erected with a fixed location on the ground or attached to something having 
a fixed location on the ground. 

substantial improvement. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a 
structure, taking place during the life of a structure, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty 
percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value 
of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of 
the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is 
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the 
building commences, whether or no that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The 
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with 
existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living 
conditions. 

(e)  Flood Hazard District boundaries. 

(1)  All properties included within the 100-year floodplain boundary on the Flood Boundary and Floodway 
Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, effective 
date September 29, 1989, or as later amended, and areas along all small streams specified by this division 
shall be included within the F Flood Hazard District boundaries. All designated properties within the Flood 
Hazard District shall be referred to by a suffix to the underlying zoning district designation (i.e., R-l-F, B-2-
F, etc.) 

(2)  All Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps published by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, dated effective September 29, 1989, and any subsequent revisions, and 
the Flood Insurance Study, dated September 29, 1989, with supporting data and maps, are hereby adopted 
by reference and declared to be supplemental to the provisions of this district. 

(3)  The delineation of any of the floodplain areas within the Flood Hazard District may be revised by the City 
Council where natural or man-made changes have occurred or detailed studies conducted or undertaken by 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual document or study indicate 
the need for revision.  Such studies may include, but not be limited to U.S. Soil Conservation Service soil 
reports, U.S. Geological Survey topographic surveys, or reports of the City Engineer or other qualified 
consultant. However, prior to any such revision, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. Upon final approval of the revised delineation of the regulated floodplain, the City 
shall give notice of the revisions to the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. 



 

47 

 

(4)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the Flood Hazard District or any 
floodplain areas within the district (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped 
boundary and actual field conditions), the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. 
Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of the district, an administrative appeal may be filed with 
the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(f)  Floodplain areas. The Flood Hazard District includes various areas subject to flooding. The primary  basis for 
the delineation of these areas shall be the Flood Insurance Study for Hueytown, Alabama prepared by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated September 29, 1989, and subsequent amendments. The 
delineations of the floodplain for the purposes of this district shall be as follows: 

(1)  Floodway. The floodway is delineated using the criteria that a certain areas within the floodplain must be 
capable of carrying the waters of the 100 year flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that 
flood at any point. These floodways are more specifically defined in the above-referenced Flood Insurance 
Study and are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps accompanying that study. 

(2)  Floodway fringe.  The floodway fringe shall be that area of the 100 year floodplain not included in the 
floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary of the floodway fringe shall be the 100 year flood 
elevations contained in the flood profiles of the above-referenced Flood Insurance Study, and the 
boundaries are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps accompanying that study. 

(3)  Approximated floodplain. The approximated floodplain shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed 
flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a 100 year floodplain boundary has been approximated. 
Such areas are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Where 
the specific 100 year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data such as 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood Prone 
Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for a permit shall have a technical study completed to determine such 
data. 

(4)  Small streams.  Small streams exist where no base flood data and no flood boundaries have been provided 
by the Flood Insurance Study. Floodplain areas along small streams are within a distance of the stream 
bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of bank or twenty feet on each side from the top 
of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer determines

hazardous and are not subject to major damage by flooding, or provided that such material and 
equipment is firmly anchored to prevent flotation or movement, or can be readily removed from the 
area within the time available after flood warning. 

f.  Other similar uses and activities provided they cause no increase in flood heights and velocities and are 
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and elevation provisions of this district. 

(4)  Special exception use criteria. In passing upon an application for a special exception use, the Zoning Board 
of Adjustment shall consider the review criteria for special exceptions contained in § 317 and in addition, 
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this district, and the 
following criteria: 

a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 

b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 

c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such 
damage on the individual owner.

k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance 
and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and 
bridges. 

(5)  Conditions attached to special exceptions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Zoning Board 
of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of special exception use permits as it deems 
necessary to further the purposes of this district. 

(l)  Variances. 

(1)  An application for a variance to the standards of this district may be submitted to the Zoning Board of 
Adjustment in accordance with the administrative provisions of this zoning ordinance.   The Board shall 
refer the variance application to a professional engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical 
assistance in evaluating the proposal in relation to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the 
plans for protection and other related matters. 

(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base 



 

52 

 

flood discharge would result. 

(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, 
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 

(4)  The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not approve a variance unless it finds the criteria variances 
contained within § 318 and in addition, the following criteria have been satisfactorily determined: 

a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 

b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 

c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased 52 flood heights, additional 
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, creation of nuisances, fraud on or victimization 
of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances. 

(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the Zoning Administrator that 
the issuance of the variance to construct a structure below the 100 year flood elevation increases the risks to 
life and property and will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 

(6)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the 
procedures set forth in this section and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration 
will not result in the structure losing its historical designation. 

(7)  The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all variance and administrative appeal actions and 
shall annually report such actions to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

(m) Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this district is considered reasonable for regulatory 
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur on rare 
occasions and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. Consequently, this district does 
not imply that land outside the floodplain or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood 
damages. Therefore, this district shall not create liability on the part of the City of Hueytown or by any officer 
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on the provisions of this district or any 
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas that serve one or two dwelling units, although 
backing onto arterial streets shall be prohibited. 

(d)  All parking areas when adjoining a street right-of-way between adjoining lots shall be physically 
separated from the right-of-way. 

(e)  All lighting fixtures used to illuminate parking areas shall not direct lights on adjoining streets or

parking exception requires satisfactory written legal documentation that the user of such satellite 
spaces has the right to such spaces. 

(3)  A joint parking area may contain required parking spaces for more than one use, provided the

Division 3. Screening and Buffer Yard Regulations 

Sec. 190. Purpose of screening and buffer yard regulations.  

The intent of this division is to set minimum standards that reduce common conflicts associated with incompatible 
adjacent land uses and to protect natural boundaries. These standards seek to promote visual harmony, reduce 
noise, divert emissions, restrict passage, and enhance the natural environment, thereby providing for a compatible 
mix of otherwise conflicting uses of adjacent properties.  

Sec. 191. Screening and buffer yard terms defined. (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2) 

The following screening and buffer yard terms when used in this ordinance shall have the meanings defined by this 
section. 

Buffer yard. A landscaped strip of specified width along certain segments of the site perimeter reserved for  
screening one use  or  structure  from another adjacent use. 

Screening. A method of visually shielding or obscuring one use or structure from another adjacent use by 
opaque fencing, walls, berms, or densely-planted vegetation installed within a buffer yard. 

Cross references - See § 371 for interpretation of definitions, § 372 for word usage, § 373 for general 
terms defined, and § 374 for uses defined. 

Sec. 192. Administration. 

(a)  These standards are intended to encourage, not hamper, innovation in landscape and architectural 
design and shall be administered flexibly so as to give reasonable consideration to this objective, 

(b)  Screening and buffer yard standards imposed by § 346 Conditional re-zoning shall take precedence 
over the provisions-of this division. (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). 

Sec. 193. Screening specifications. 

(a)  Acceptable screening materials include any combination of solid fencing (weather-resistant wood, 
brick, or decorative masonry), evergreen shrubs, or earth berms of a specified height. Planting of 
evergreen trees may also be required. Screening shall be continuously maintained, present an 
attractive exterior appearance, and in the case of fencing, be of durable construction. 

(b)  Location of screening shall not obstruct the visibility of traffic circulation.(Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). 

(c)  Evergreen plantings, where installed, shall be planted within the beginning of the first opportune planting 
season following approval of development but may be coordinated with  construction  scheduling. 
Evergreen shrubs shall be a rapid growth variety, with a minimum height of three feet at planting, be 
planted two feet on center or less, and be capable of attaining an opaque density to the prescribed ultimate 
height within two years of planting.  Evergreen trees shall be a rapid growth variety and be a minimum 
height of five feet at planting and be planted eight feet on center or less.(Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). 

(d)  Fencing, where installed, shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 

(e)  All plantings shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition and, when necessary, replaced 
with new growth. All fencing shall be permanently maintained in good condition and, whenever necessary, 
repaired or replaced. 

Sec. 194. Buffer yard specifications. (Ref. Ord. # 95-0926-2). 



 

83 

 

(a)  The buffer yard shall be reserved solely for screening.  No building, structure (except for privacy fencing) 
nor paving shall be permitted.   The entire buffer yard shall be planted with trees and shrubs. 

(b)  The amount of buffer yard shall not be more than 10 percent of the total site area, but in such case that the 
buffer yard is reduced, the intensity of screening shall be proportionately increased.   In no such event 
however, shall a buffer yard on a site be reduced to less than seven feet in width. 

Sec. 195. Determination of adjacent land use classes. 

The required screening and buffer yard shall depend on the land use intensity of the site in comparison to adjacent 
sites, including those directly across any right-of-way. The classes of land uses are shown on the following table 
which determines the class according to the principal use of the site. 

Table X. Land Use Classes 

class   principal land use          
    A      Single family residences, including farm residences, vacant lots zoned  AG, R-l, R-2, R-3, or 

reserved for single family residences in a residential cluster subdivision or planned unit 
development.

nonconformity, such as creating an off-premises sign where such a sign would not be permitted. 

(e)  Unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance, any sign that does not conform 
with the provisions of these sign regulations shall be amortized to conform with this Ordinance, as follows:

will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed and substantial 
justice done. More specifically, the Board shall determine all of the following criteria have been satisfied: 

(1)  The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship, even to the extent of 
authorizing nonconforming uses.  Where the Board authorizes a nonconforming use in a district to 
prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors, when taken together, must indicate that the plight of 
the premises in question is unique in that they cannot be put reasonably to a conforming use because of 
the limitations imposed upon them by reason of their classification in a specific zone. 

(2)  Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. 

(3)  Hardship alone is not sufficient; Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship. 

(4)  Mere financial loss of a kind which might be common to all of the property owners in a district in not 
an unnecessary hardship. 

(5)  Variances should be granted sparingly, and spirit of this ordinance in harmony with the spirit of State 
law should be carefully preserved, to the end that the structure of this ordinance would not disintegrate 
and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands of the Board. 

(6)  When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for claim that a variance should be 
granted. 

(b)  Application for variance. An application for a variance shall be filed with the Secretary at least 30 days 
before the scheduled hearing date before the Board of Adjustment.  The application shall be filed by the 
property owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made available by the Secretary and shall 
include the following information and materials: 

(1)  Name, signature, and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, if any. 

(2)  Address of the property under consideration.  

(3)  Zoning and land use of the property under consideration. 

(4)  Nature of the variance with reference to applicable zoning provisions. 

(5)  Justification for the variance in accordance with all of the criteria in (a) above. 

(6)  A vicinity map showing the location of the property. 

(7)  A plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property boundaries and proposed 
development layout with the variance noted or highlighted. 



 

103 

 

(8)  Stamped no. 10 envelopes (legal size) with the names and addresses of adjacent property owners 
(including those directly across a public right-of-way), as shown in the most recent records of the 
Jefferson County Tax Assessor. 

(9)  A $100 filing fee. 

(c)  At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Board of Adjustment hearing, the Secretary shall give written notice 
of the variance to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the 
United States mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as 
submitted with the application. The notice shall state the following information: 

(1)  The name of the applicant. 

(2)  The location of the property. 

(3)  The nature of the variance and the applicable zoning provisions. 

(4)  The time, date, and location of the Board hearing.

Division 3. Non-conformities  

Sec. 330. Purpose of provisions for non-conformities. 

Within the districts established by this ordinance or by subsequent amendments to this ordinance, lawful uses, lots, 
buildings, and characteristics of uses existed in conformity to all applicable zoning provisions before this ordinance 
was adopted or subsequently amended. However, as a result of adoption or subsequent amendment to this ordinance, 
such lawful activities no longer conform to all applicable zoning provisions.  These activities shall be deemed lawful 
non-conformities, which are permitted to remain under the provisions of this division. It is the intent of this division 
that the continuation of lawful non-conformities should not be indefinite and that all non-conformities with this 
ordinance should gradually be removed.

standards, or any supplemental standards for the district in which it is located or is designed or intended for 
a nonconforming use.

permitted uses for the district in which it is located. 

Sec. 332. Continuation of non-conformities.

(1)  If any changes in ownership or tenancy occur, any nonconformity may be continued by the new owner 
or tenant under the provisions of this division. 

(2)  A nonconformity may continue if it does not cease for any reason for a period exceeding six months. 

(3)  Plans for nonconforming construction, site development, site alteration, use or occupancy for which a 
valid building permit, certificate of occupancy, site plan, special exception, preliminary subdivision 
plat, or other City license was approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent 
amendment may proceed. However, all construction, site development, or site alteration must be 
completed within one year and use or occupancy must be established within 30 days after the effective 
completion date. 

(4)  A lot that was legally platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance that does not meet the lot area, 
width, or dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located may be developed or used in 
conformity with all other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not 
of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. 

(5)  Any use in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment that results 
in a non-conforming characteristic of use may continue in nonconformity with the off-street parking 
and loading, screening and buffer yard, sign, or supplemental standards so long as the kind or extent of 
such use does not increase the ordinance requirements for such characteristics of use. 



 

105 

 

(6)  A non-conforming use may occupy any part of a structure or lot that was arranged or designed for such 
use unless occupancy of that part of the structure or lot has been discontinued for a period exceeding 
six months. 

Sec. 333. "Repair and maintenance of non-conformities.            - 

(a)  On any structure, devoted entirely or partly to a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary

of the structure, as it existed at the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment, shall not be 
increased. The cost of the work shall not exceed ten percent of the appraised replacement cost of the 
structure or the part. 

(b)  On any lot devoted entirely or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary 
maintenance or repair and replacement of parking and loading areas, signs, lighting, fences, walls, and 
related exterior amenities provided the extent of those amenities shall not be increased or rearranged. 

(c)  Nothing in this division shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any 
structure or exterior amenity declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, on 
order of such official, nor shall anything in this division be deemed to exempt any such structure or amenity 
from any requirements of any federal, state, or local government regulation. 

Sec. 334. Alteration, enlargement, or restoration of non-conformities. 

(a)  No non-conforming use shall be enlarged within a structure or occupy a greater area of land than at the 
effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment.

effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment. 

(c)  No nonconforming use, structure or characteristic of use may be altered or enlarged or intensified in any 
way, which increases its nonconformity but may be altered or reduced to decrease its nonconformity.

exceeds fifty percent of the original value of the structure immediately before the damaging occurrence, 
subsequent use of the lot shall be in full compliance with the district in which it is located. 

Sec. 335. Change in use. 

(a)  Any non-conforming use, which changes to a permitted use within the district in which it is located, shall 
not revert to a nonconforming use. 

(b)  A nonconforming use may change to a new nonconforming use provided the new use is more in keeping 
with the district in which it is located and is less objectionable and measures less external impact than the 
existing non-conforming use. In determining whether the new use would be in greater conformity with this 
ordinance, impact criteria such as, but not limited to, the following shall be evaluated: 

(1)  Traffic generation and congestion, including truck, passenger car, and pedestrian traffic. 

(2)  Noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, odor, glare, or vibration.      

Sec. 336. Appraised cost or value. 

For the purpose of this division, appraised cost or value shall refer to an appraised valuation by a board of not less 
than three professionally certified real estate appraisers.

(2)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such Board is required 
to pass under such ordinance; and

sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called on by such 
writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the 
grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified.
