7-2 PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES 

 

 (b) Approval of Plans and Issuance of Building Permits (Ord. 947, 3/27/14) 

 

The Building Official is authorized to approve any plans or issue a building permit 

for construction once they have reviewed the plans in detail and found them to be 

in conformity with this Ordinance. 

 

To this end, the Building Official shall require every application for a building 

permit for construction, use of land, moving or alteration be accompanied by a plan 

or plat drawn to scale and showing sufficient detail to enable the Building Official 

to ascertain whether the proposed construction, use of land, moving, or alteration 

is in conformance with this Ordinance. 

 

Such plan or plat shall include, as a minimum the following: 

 

(1) The actual shape, proportion, and dimension of the lot to be built upon.

      to be erected, altered, moved, or existing on the lot. 

(3) The existing and intended use of all such buildings or other structures. 

 

If the proposed excavation, construction, moving, or alterations as set forth in the 

application are in conformity with the provisions as provided herein, the Building 

Official of the Municipality shall issue a building permit accordingly. Unless an 

applicant agrees to an extension, the Building Official will rule on all applications 

for building permits within thirty (30) days of the submittal of a complete 

application to the Building Department. If the Building Official has not approved

this Ordinance on the part of the building, owner, or applicant. If an application for 

building permit is denied based upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day time limit 

herein, the applicant will have thirty (30) days to request in writing from the

with the provisions of this Ordinance.  

 

  The owner or their agent is required to notifiy the Building Official that a building, 

premises, or part thereof is ready for occupancy or use. Within seven (7) days of 

notification and upon verification by the Building Official that all notices, 

information, and other requested data utilized by the City to determine project and 

building compliance with all relevant state and municipal codes and regulations,

 53 

ARTICLE XI 

 

MINIMUM STANDARDS AND REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

 

11-1 SUITABILITY OF LAND 

 

The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from adequate 

investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that it is 

not in the best interest of the public or the proposed development is not suitable for platting 

or subdividing purposes. The design and improvements of all subdivisions and 

developments shall meet all State and Mobile County Health Department requirements and 

proof thereof shall be submitted. 

 

11-2 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING 

 

Land subject to flooding or inadequately served by drainage facilities shall not be 

acceptable for development or subdivision unless the owner or sub-divider agrees to make 

such improvements as will render the land fit for occupancy in conformity with the 

National Flood Insurance Program.  Fill may not be used to raise land in areas subject to 

flood and/or excessive erosion, unless the fill proposed does not restrict the natural flow of 

water, advance erosion, and unduly increase flood heights. 

 

To ensure proper development in flood prone areas, the Planning Commission shall require 

the owner/developer to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate the 

sites will be free from the danger of flooding. 

 

If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed subdivision or development, the plat 

or site plan shall provide for an easement or right-of-way along the stream for a floodway.  

For the smaller streams, the plat or site plan  shall also provide for channel improvement 

to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The floor elevations of houses 

shall be high enough to be above the regulatory flood. The flood way easement shall be 

wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas 

become more highly developed and runoff rates are increased. 

 

Approval will not be given for streets within a subdivision which the Planning Commission 

determines would be subject to excessive inundation or flooding. 

 

11-3 CONFORMANCE WITH EXISTING PLANS 

 

Proposed improvements in all subdivision developments within the extraterritorial 

planning jurisdiction shall be in conformance with existing approved plans, maps, 

ordinances, and design standards of the City of Saraland and/or the Planning Commission. 

 

Any subdivision recorded prior to the enactment of this Ordinance shall remain a legal 

subdivision unless a replat of said subdivision is submitted and approved. 

 

11-4 PENALTIES 

 

The developer, owner, or agent of the owner of any land to be subdivided in the corporate 

limits extraterritorial planning jurisdiction who transfers, sells,  agrees to sell, or negotiates 



 
 54 

to sell such land by reference to, an exhibition of, or by other use of a plat to subdivide 

such land before such plat has been approved by the Planning Commission and recorded 

in the Office of the Probate Judge of Mobile County shall forfeit and pay a penalty of one 

hundred dollars ($100.00) for each lot or parcel so transferred or sold, and the description 

by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer, or other document used in the process 

of selling or transfer shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. 

 

The City of Saraland, through its attorney or other designated representative, may enjoin 

such transfer, sale, or agreement by appropriate action. 

 

No plat of a subdivision in the corporate limits or its extraterritorial planning jurisdiction 

shall be filed by a subdivider in the Office of the Probate Judge until it shall have been 

submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission and such approval entered in 

writing on the plat by the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, or Secretary of the Commission. The 

Probate Judge shall not file or record a plat of a subdivision which does not have the 

approval of the Planning Commission. 

 

Any building or structure erected or to be erected in violation of subdivision regulations 

shall be deemed an unlawful building or structure, and the Building Official may bring 

action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed. 

 

11-5 EXCEPTIONS  

 

Whenever the strict compliance with these regulations would result in an extraordinary 

hardship or injustice to the sub-divider because of topography, unusual size or shape of the 

property, or unusual conditions in surrounding property of development, the Planning 

Commission may modify, vary, or waive such regulations so the sub-divider may subdivide 

his property in a reasonable manner provided that such modification, variation, or waiver 

shall not nullify the intent or purpose of the subdivision regulations, the public welfare, 

and interest of the City of Saraland shall be protected. Any such variation together with 

reasons therefore shall be so noted in the minutes of the Planning Commission. 

 

In granting modifications, variations or waivers, the Planning Commission may impose 

such other reasonable conditions as will, in its judgment, justify such modification, 

variation, or waiver and still substantially maintain the objectives of these regulations. Each 

modification, variation or waiver of the regulations sought by a sub-divider shall be applied 

for and acted upon individually by the Planning Commission. 

 

The sale or exchange of lots or parcels of land between adjoining property owners may be 

exempt from these regulations by the Planning Commission, provided no additional lots 

are created, none of the lots affected by the sale or exchange are reduced below the 

minimum size requirements of the zoning district in which the division is to occur.  

 

No existing easement shall be vacated or moved without the recommendation of the 

Planning Commission and the acceptance by resolution of the City Council. 

 

11-6 AMENDMENTS

 56 

developer/owner shall construct such streets in accordance with good engineering practices 

and the standards prescribed herein in these regulations, as required by the City Engineer 

or his duly authorized representative, State, County Highway Department, and the 

department of the respective utility.  

 

Except as approved by the Planning Commission for a private subdivision, the full width 

of the right-of-way shall be graded including the subgrade of the areas to be paved. This 

requirement may be modified for the purpose of preserving the natural beauty of the area. 

A base course consisting of at least eight (8) inches of a sand-clay mixture with one hundred 

percent (100%) standard compaction shall be laid on a soundly prepared subgrade. A prime 

coat shall be sprayed uniformly over the base course. An approved type wearing surface in 

conformance with State Highway Standard 416-A one-and-one-half  (1-1/2) inches thick 

compacted shall be laid over the prime coat. If curbs and gutters are required, they must be 

in conformance with approved State and County Highway Department standards. Private 

subdivision rights-of-way roads shall comply with all relevant portions of the Private 

Subdivision Standards contained herein.  

 

All grading in the subdivision shall be related to the topography and environmental features 

of the surrounding area. Unpaved areas within a dedicated street right-of-way shall be 

graded and seeded in a manner that will enhance the appearance of the environment. 

 

All water mains, sanitary sewers and laterals, and storm sewers shall be installed as 

necessary to prevent the future cutting of the pavement of any street, sidewalk, or other 

required pavement. 

 

11-9 ISSUANCE OF SITE DISTURBANCE PERMIT

licensed engineer that all improvements have been properly and adequately installed. Upon 

receipt of the requested and certification, the City Engineers or his duly authorized 

representative shall inspect the site to determine if the required improvements are 

satisfactorily installed according to the plans and specifications.  

 

To determine if the streets are installed to minimum design standards, the City of Saraland 

shall select an independent testing laboratory to make the necessary tests. These tests shall 

be conducted at the expense of the developer/owner. 

 

11-11 SIDEWALKS 

 (Ord. 990, 11-13-14) 

 



 
 57

improvement of all streets prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy in all districts 

except M-2, General Industrial Districts.  Sidewalks are not required in an M-2, General 

Industrial District, but the developer and/or owner may provide for sidewalks in all or a 

portion of a development.  If the owner and/or developer of a project within an M-2 General 

Industrial District provides for sidewalks, they may be installed on one (1) or both sides of 

a street.   

 

 If sidewalks are required or provided in a development plan, construction of sidewalks, 

shall comply with the following standards: 

 

     Type of Subdivision    Sidewalk Width 

  Low Density Residential    4 feet 

  High Density Residential    5 feet 

  Commercial      6 feet 

  Industrial      6 feet 

 

The developer shall also certify that all installed sidewalks comply with all statutory and  

regulatory requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act.  

 

11-12 WATER AND SEWER CONNECTIONS  

 

(a) Connection to Public or Private Water and Sanitary Sewer System: 

 

Developments, individual lots, or parcels shall be properly connected to a public or 

private community water and sanitary sewer system where such systems borders 

the development, lot line, or is reasonably available and the appropriate utility has 

the capacity to provide the service. Otherwise, lots must meet all applicable 

requirements of the Mobile County Health Department for onsite wells and/or 

individual septic systems. The lines for both domestic use and fire protection shall 

be approved by a public or private water supply and constructed in such a manner 

as to adequately serve all of the lots located within the subdivision. Water wells for 

purposes other than human consumption may continue to be used. If a well is 

required for each lot, the location, construction, and use of such well shall also meet 

the Mobile County Health Department requirements. If a well is to serve more than 

one lot, a public community water system shall be required.  

 

It is the intent of this Ordinance to eliminate by attrition, all existing private wells, 

and individual septic systems in areas where public or private community water 

and sanitary sewer systems are available. Therefore, at such time as any private 

well or individual septic system fails to function properly or must be replaced, the 

owner must connect to the public or private community water and sanitary sewer 

system where such systems borders any development, lot line, or are reasonably 

available and the appropriate utility has the capacity to provide the service.  

 

Local ordinances and sewer regulations as adopted by the City are applicable.

(a) Utility Placement: 



 
 58 

Water, sewer, gas, electric power, telephone, cable tv,  and other  utility lines shall 

be installed underground by the developer and/or owner in all new residential, 

commercial, or industrial developments, expansions and/or renovations of existing 

said developments shall be connected to a central distribution system, unless for 

good reasons other than cost, the Planning Commission approves a modification or 

waiver of this requirement in part or in whole, or if a special condition requires 

otherwise. 

 

(b) Drainage and Utility Easements: 

 

Easements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet and located along the side or 

rear lot lines shall be provided as is necessary to utility lines, underground mains, 

and cables.  Where a development or subdivision is traversed by a water course, 

drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water or drainage 

right-of-way of adequate width to accommodate normal runoff. 

 

(c) Location of Fire Hydrants:  

Roadway fire hydrants shall be installed along each street at the center of each block 

and at one corner of each roadway intersection, provided, however, that in no event 

shall fire hydrants be spaced so that any fire hydrant is located more than six 

hundred (600) feet from another fire hydrant. The water supply and pressure shall 

be sufficient to provide adequate fire protection and the future needs of the intended 

land use. Additional fire hydrant placement may be required on the interior of 

developed lots pursuant to local ordinance and fire regulations as adopted by the 

City.    

 

(d) Location of Street Lighting: 

 

In all multi-family developments and subdivsions, lighting shall be installed at all 

intersections, curves, and cul-de-sacs. If additional lighting is consistent with safety 

and other community needs are deemed necessary, the Building Department may 

require the sub-divider or subdivider to present a street lighting plan developed in 

conjunction with the appropriate utility company having jurisdiction within the 

area. 

 

(e) Placement of Street Signs:

and radius points. 

 

Iron pins one-half (½) inch in diameter and two (2) feet long shall be driven flush  



 
 59 

with the grade at each lot corner and at each point where the property line changes  

direction.  

 

(g) Annexation Provision for Extraterritorial Planning Jurisdiction Subdivisions: 

 

Proposed residential and/or commercial subdivisions located in the extraterritorial 

planning jurisdiction which are contiguous to the corporate limits, shall be required 

to annex into the City of Saraland prior to approval of said subdivision, if it is 

deemed by the Planning Commission to be in the best interest of the City.

12-3 BUSINESS DISTRICTS  

 

(a) B-1, Local Business District:   

 

This district is intended to provide for limited retail convenience goods and 

personal service establishments in residential neighborhoods and to encourage the 

concentration of these uses in one location for each residential neighborhood rather 

than in scattered sites occupied by individual shops throughout a neighborhood.

and major transportation facilities.  It is further the intent of this section to protect 

appropriate sites from encroachment by incompatible uses through the 

establishment of regulations that would permit manufacturing and heavy industry 

to function in proximity to dissimilar uses.  The M-2 General Industrial District 

regulations are intended to promote the health, safety, welfare, comfort and 

convenience of the users of this district as well as the inhabitants of the surrounding 

districts.

 STORM WATER DETENTION 

 

18-1 GENERAL POLICY 

 

The main objective of drainage design shall be the safety of the traveling public with the 

protection of City of Saraland and private property consistent with good engineering 

practice. 

 

18-2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 

 

The responsible Design Engineer shall not submit for approval any plat of a subdivision or 

site plan which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood water runoff channels 

or basins.  The storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary 

sewer system. A copy of the design computations sealed by a registered engineer shall be 

submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across 

any intersection, nor for a distance of more than six hundred (600) feet in the gutter. When 

calculations indicate curb capacities are exceeded at a point, catch basins shall be used to 

intercept flow at that point. 

 

Storm sewers and drainage structures shall be designed and installed as required in 

accordance with good engineering practice.  The minimum pipe diameter of storm drains 

shall be fifteen (15) inches. In no case shall storm water empty into the sanitary sewer 

system. 

 

18-3  LOCATION 

 

The applicant/developer will be required to carry away by pipe or open concrete paved ditch 

any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to or as a result of the 

subdivision. Such drainage facilities may be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, 

or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in 

accordance with the Alabama Department of Transportation Standard Specifications. 

 

18-4   ACCESSIBILITY TO PUBLIC STORM SEWERS   

 

Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant will be required to install storm sewer 

facilities or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provisions shall be made 

for the disposal of storm waters, subject to the specifications and calculations submitted by 

the Design Engineer. 

 

If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as a result of phased 

construction, the developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a 

storm sewer system at the time the plat receives final approval. Provisions for such 

connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond required for the 

subdivision plat.  Where a storm drainage system is not accessible, the subdivider shall 

install all drainage structures necessary to convey the water to a location acceptable to the 

City. All open drainage ditches shall be paved with an acceptable material. 



 

 96 

 

18-5  ACCOMMODATION OF UPSTREAM DRAINAGE AREAS 

 

A culvert, pipe, or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be of sufficient size to 

accommodate potential developed property storm water runoff from its upstream drainage 

area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Design Engineer shall review the 

necessary size of the facility based on the provisions of the construction standards and 

specifications. 

 

18-6 EFFECT ON DOWNSTREAM DRAINAGE AREAS   

 

The Design Engineer shall also review the effect of each development on existing 

downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the development.  These drainage studies, 

together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed 

improvements.  Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development 

will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, approval of the development may be 

withheld until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential condition in 

such sum as the Design Engineer shall determine. No development shall be approved unless 

adequate drainage will be provided to the natural drainage watercourse or an existing facility. 

 

18-7   GENERAL PROVISIONS 

 

All developments shall be provided with adequate storm drainage facilities.   

 

Any areas subject to periodic flooding caused by poor drainage facilities will not be accepted 

unless the developer or subdivider makes necessary provisions to eliminate such flooding in 

conformity with the National Flood Insurance Program. 

 

Fill may not be used to raise land in areas subject to flood and/or excessive erosion, unless 

the fill proposed does not restrict the natural flow of water, advance erosion, and unduly 

increase flood heights. 

 

A complete drainage plan and contour map showing the pipe sizes, their locations and the 

areas to be drained, shall be submitted along with the profile grades and typical roadway 

section for approval. 

 

All existing drainage structures shall also be shown. 

 

All off project drainage, draining onto the subdivision, shall be shown on contour maps 

and/or construction plans showing the areas in acres the subdivision will have to 

accommodate. 

 

On any single drainage structure requiring twenty (20) square feet or more of end area, a 

special design drawing will be required for approval.  All roadway cross drain pipes shall be 

reinforced concrete and have a minimum size of eighteen (18) inches.  

 

Only pipe that meets specifications equaling Alabama State Highway Department 

Specifications will be acceptable. 

 

No unacceptable pipe shall be used. 



 

 97 

 

Where the subdivider has open ditches, a maximum of three to one (3:1) front slopes and 

flat bottom ditch is required; the width of the ditch shall be determined by the required flows 

and the existing conditions and as determined by the Design Engineer. V-bottom ditches or 

other special designs may be permitted in special cases if they are concrete slope paved. 

 

The provisions of this Article shall apply to all developers and/or subdividers. 

 

18-8  EASEMENTS 

 

Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of 

drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 

twenty (20) feet in width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property 

outside the road lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated 

on the record plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to the natural 

watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 

 

The applicant may be required to dedicate either in fee, drainage, or by conservation 

easement land on both sides of existing watercourses to a distance that is adequate to 

discharge flood waters without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more 

than one foot. 

 

Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing during storm 

periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication shall be preserved and retained in 

their natural state as drainage ways, except where improvements are warranted and may be 

deemed necessary by the Design Engineer. 

 

18-9 DEDICATION OF EASEMENTS 

 

Where a subdivision or development of land is traversed by watercourse, drainage way, 

channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way 

conforming substantially to the lines of such water course, and of such width and 

construction or both as shall be adequate for the purpose. For the smaller streams, the plat 

shall also provide for channel improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable floods 

within banks.  The floor elevations of houses or buildings shall be high enough to be above 

the regulatory flood.  The flood way easement shall be wide enough to provide for future 

enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more highly developed and 

runoff rates are increased.

maps, assumptions, calculations, and narrative statements as needed to describe accurately 

the proposed development of the site and the measures planned to meet the Basic Control 

Objectives. Plan content may vary to meet the needs of the specific site conditions. 

 

18-21 PROTECTION OF PROPERTY   

 

Persons engaged in land-disturbing activities shall take all reasonable measures to protect 

all public and private property, including roadways, from damage by such activities. 

 

18-22 BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES 

   

The basic control objectives which should be considered the minimum in developing and 

implementing an erosion and sediment control plan are to: 

 

(a) Identify Critical Areas: 

 

On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are 

especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be 

identified and receive special attention. 

 

(b) Limit Exposed Areas: 

 

All land-disturbing activities should be planned and conducted to minimize the size 

of the area to be exposed at any one time. 

 

(c) Limit Time of Exposure: 

 

All land-disturbing activities should be planned and conducted to limit exposure to 

the shortest time. 

 

(d) Surface Water Control: 

 

Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to 

reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure. 

 

(e) Sedimentation Control: 

 

All land-disturbing activities should be planned and conducted so as to minimize off-

site sediment damage. 

 

(f) Manage Storm Water Runoff: 

 

When the increase in the peak rates and velocity of storm water runoff resulting from 

a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause damaging accelerated erosion of the 



 

 101 

receiving ditch or channel stream, plans are to include measures to control both the 

velocity and rate of an increase so as to minimize accelerated erosion and increased 

sediment deposition in the ditch or stream channel. 

 

18-23 MANDATORY STANDARDS 

 

No land-disturbing activity subject to these provisions and guidelines shall be undertaken 

except in accordance with the following requirements: 

 

(a) No activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake, natural watercourse, or adjacent 

property where applicable unless a buffer zone is provided along the boundary of 

sufficient width to confine visible siltation and/or prevent erosion, provided that the 

land-disturbing activity is not in connection with the construction of facilities to be 

located on, over, or under a lake, natural watercourse, or the adjacent property. 

 

(b) The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be 

retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures. 

 

(c) In any event, slopes left exposed shall within thirty (30) working days of completion 

of final grading be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or 

structures sufficient to restrain erosion.  

 

(d) Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one 

(1) acre, if more than one (1) contiguous acre is uncovered, a ground cover sufficient 

to restrain erosion must be planted or otherwise provided within thirty (30) working 

days on the portion of the tract upon which further active construction is not being 

undertaken, provided this activity shall not apply to cleared land forming the basin 

of a reservoir later to be inundated. 

 

18-24  DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

 

Erosion and sediment control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, 

and constructed as to provide control from the calculated peak rates of runoff from a ten-

year frequency storm.  

Runoff rates may be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation 

Services “National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices,” or other 

acceptable calculation procedures. Runoff computations shall be based on rainfall data 

published by the National Weather Service for the area. 

 

18-25  OTHER REQUIREMENTS 

 

(a) Permanent Downstream Protection of Stream Banks and Channels:   

 

Provision shall be made for the permanent protection of off-site stream banks and 

channels from the erosive effects of increased velocity and volume of storm water 

runoff resulting from certain land-disturbing activities. 

 

A combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be 

required for all highway construction, business, commercial, industrial, educational, 

institutional developments of one (1) acre or more, and all residential developments. 



 

 102 

 

Detention, storage, and controlled release will not be required in those instances 

where the person planning to conduct the activity can demonstrate that the storm 

water release will not cause an increase in accelerated erosion or sedimentation of 

the receiving ditch, stream channel, overload downstream drainage ways, or other 

drainage facility, taking into consideration any anticipated development of the 

watershed in question. 

 

(b) Borrow and Waste Areas:   

 

When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person 

conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is 

obtained shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the borrow 

material is being used or from which the waste material originated.   

 

When the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is not the person obtaining 

the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate 

land-disturbing activity. 

 

(c)  Access and Haul Roads: 

 

Temporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in 

connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part of such 

activity. 

 

(d) Operations in Lakes or Natural Watercourses: 

 

 Land-disturbing activity in connection with construction, in, on, over, under a lake, 

or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to 

minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel.  

 

The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed 

activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow 

characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow 

characteristic is provided. 

 

(e) Responsibility for Maintenance: 

 

The person engaged in or conducting the land-disturbing activity shall be responsible 

for maintaining all temporary or permanent erosion and sediment control measures 

and facilities during the development of a site. 

 

The responsibility for maintaining all permanent erosion and sediment control 

measures and facilities, after site development is completed, shall lie with the 

landowner, except for public drainage facilities. 

 

18-26  GUIDELINES FOR EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES 

 

   Persons engaged in planning, designing, installing and maintaining erosion and sediment 

control measures may use generally accepted references on the subject following standard 



 

 103 

engineering and/or agricultural practices.  All plans will be subject to review by the Building 

Inspector. 

 

18-27 ADDITIONAL MEASURES   

 

Whenever the Building Inspector determines that significant erosion or sedimentation is 

occurring as a result of a land-disturbing activity, despite application and maintenance of 

protective practices, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity, or the person 

responsible for maintenance will be required to take additional protective action. 

 

18-28 STORM WATER DETENTION - GENERAL 

 

Developments which produce an increase in the amount of storm water runoff will be 

required to construct storm water detention ponds or other approved types of detention 

devices. 

 

The developer shall submit, detailed engineering plans to the City including historical runoff, 

developed runoff, detention pond details, method of discharge, and other information as 

required for review.  The developer shall also include the method of maintenance for the 

detention pond after the development is complete. 

 

18-29 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER DETENTION AND DESIGN 

CRITERIA 

 

Among the consequences of growth and development, two are of great relevance to storm 

water management. Increased runoff created by the change of the nature and properties of 

the surface of the ground and velocity of discharge of this increased runoff. 

 

The natural condition of the land before development is in relative balance with the natural 

capacity of the receiving streams. The undeveloped conditions provide greater permeability 

and longer time of concentration. By modification of the surface from the irregular, pervious, 

areas are changed to a more impervious and more effectively drained and in most cases 

denuded of vegetation.   

 

It is the intent of this section to alert the developers to possible harmful effects from any land 

development project on properties downstream and provide a guideline for evaluation and 

control of the elements related to storm water which affects the welfare and safety of citizens 

of the City of Saraland. 

 

In order to provide some control of these possible harmful elements of development and to 

reduce economic losses due to erosion and flooding, the criteria of differential runoff and 

storm water detention are hereby established. Post-development release rates shall not 

exceed pre-development rates. When feasible, the differential runoff should be less. 

 

The terms of these design criteria shall become effective for all projects in the extraterritorial 

planning jurisdiction of the City of Saraland. 

 

18-30 JURISDICTION   

 

All projects which fall under the inspection, permitting, or extraterritorial planning 



 

 104 

jurisdiction of the City, on items related to storm water management and site development 

within the corporate limits of the City, as well as, the incorporated areas and unincorporated 

areas of Mobile County. 

 

18-31 LIABILITY 

 

The design criteria establish minimum elements of design which must be implemented with 

good engineering and good workmanship.   

 

Use of the information contained herein for placement of any structure or use of land, shall 

not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the City, its offices or 

employees, of the practicability, adequacy or safety and shall not create liability upon or 

cause action against any such public body, office, or employee for any damage that may 

result pursuant thereto. 

 

18-32  ENGINEER’S SEAL   

 

All plans and specifications submitted for review and/or approval shall be prepared by, or 

under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer, licensed in the State of 

Alabama, and shall meet the minimum standards and requirements of the City and other 

applicable authorities.   

 

Each of the plan, profile and special drawing sheets for a project shall bear a legible stamp 

of the Professional Engineer in charge. 

 

If the name or license number is not clear, the signature and number shall be added. It is 

imperative that the professional design engineer be qualified in the area of drainage per the 

State of Alabama registration laws. 

 

18-33  PRE-DESIGN CONFERENCE 

 

The developer and the consulting engineer are encouraged to contact the City for a pre-

design conference at the conceptual stage of the project. Such conference would be mutually 

beneficial to outline the complexity and scope of design, applicability of criteria and 

elimination of possible items of conflict during the review process. Subsequent conferences, 

during the preparation of plans may be arranged by the consulting engineer or the developer 

to obtain preliminary, informal decisions on items in need of clarification. 

 

18-34 LETTER TRANSMITTAL 

 

   In order to facilitate review of plans, all projects shall be submitted with a letter of transmittal 

which shall include the name of the project, name and address of the owner and/or developer, 

telephone number of the engineer, and clarification as to the purpose of submittal. 

 

18-35 DIFFERENTIAL RUNOFF 

 

The difference in rate and volume of storm water runoff from a parcel or project in its 

undeveloped natural condition and its developed condition is known as the differential 

runoff. 

 



 

 105 

18-36 DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTED 

 

Detention requirements are directly related to permitted land use where it exists. The 

permitted densities and minimum lot areas are important factors in the anticipated runoff.  

 

Projects of small acreage may be required to provide detention if conditions in the receiving 

system are inadequate or harmful effects can be anticipated if detention is not implemented. 

 

18-37 PHASING AND PLATTING 

 

The effective acreage for a project is not limited to a fractional part of the total concept, 

rather if a project is developed in phases of small plats, the total acreage of the conceptual 

project shall be considered. 

 

18-38 METHOD OF EVALUATION 

 

Differential runoff evaluation consists of the determination of the rate of runoff before and 

after development, determination of required volume of detention and verification of 

adequacy of discharge and control structures. 

 

Design should be based on a minimum of a twenty-five (25) year storm or a twenty-four 

(24) hour event. This shall be based on sound engineering criteria and computations shall be 

submitted to the City for review. 

 

18-39 METHOD OF DETENTION: 

 

The following conditions and limitations should be observed in selection and use of method 

of detention: 

 

(a) General Location:  

 

(1) Detention facilities shall be located within the parcel limits of the project 

under consideration. 

 

(2) No detention or ponding will be permitted within public road rights-of-way. 

 

(3) Location of detention facilities immediately upstream or downstream of the 

project will be considered by special request if proper documentation is 

submitted with reference to practicality, feasibility and proof of ownership or 

right-of-use of the area proposed. 

 

18-40 COMMON GROUND PROJECTS 

 

It is preferred that detention facilities be always located in common ground.   

 

Projects developed under these procedures shall establish, in the recorded plat,  maintenance 

and access easements for the detention facilities and include provisions for maintenance in 

the Trust Indentures. 

 

The entire reservoir area of the open channel shall be seeded, fertilized, mulched, sodded, 



 

 106 

paved, or lined prior to final plat approval by the City. 

 

The hydraulic elevations resulting from channel detention shall not adversely affect 

adjoining properties. 

 

18-41 PERMANENT LAKES 

 

Permanent lakes with fluctuating volume controls may be used as detention areas provided 

that the limits of maximum ponding elevations are no closer than thirty (30) feet horizontally 

from any building and less than two (2) feet below the lowest sill elevation of any building. 

 

Maximum side slopes for the fluctuating area of permanent lakes shall be one (1) foot 

vertical to three (3) feet horizontal (3:1) unless proper provisions are included for safety, 

stability and ease of maintenance. 

 

Maximum fluctuation from permanent pool elevation to maximum ponding elevation shall 

be three (3) feet, with a greater depth subject to approval. 

 

Special consideration is suggested to safety and accessibility for small children in design of 

permanent lakes in residential areas and fencing may be required. 

 

Viability of the permanent impoundment pool no greater than one-tenth the size of the 

tributary drainage area.  It is suggested that the maximum depth of twenty-five percent (25%) 

of the permanent pool area be no greater than six (6) feet. Allowances for silting under 

denuded soil conditions, during construction, for a period not less than one (1) year is also 

recommended. 

 

The entire fluctuating area of the permanent reservoir shall be seeded, fertilized and 

mulched, sodded or paved prior to release of surety if required by the City.  Any area 

susceptible to or designed as overflow by higher design intensity rainfall, as indicated 

previously, shall be sodded or paved. 

 

18-42 PARKING LOTS 

 

Detention is permitted in parking lots to maximum depth of eight (8) inches. In no case 

should the maximum limits of ponding be designed closer than ten (10) feet from a building 

unless water proof of the building and pedestrian accessibility is properly documented. 

 

The minimum freeboard from the maximum ponding elevation to the lowest sill elevation 

shall be one (1) foot. 

 

18-43 OTHER METHODS 

 

Other methods of detention such as seepage pits, french drains, etc. are discouraged.  If other 

methods are proposed, proper documentation of soils data, percolation, geological features, 

will be needed for review and consideration. 

 

18-44 VERIFICATION OF ADEQUACY 

 

Analysis of all elements of design is always performed by the registered professional 



 

 107 

engineer.  The following outline is provided to ascertain that certain critical elements of 

design are in workable compliance with the aims of design: 

 

(a) Volume of retention for the total project 

(b) Tributary (Q) peak runoff to basin 

(c) Balanced maximum outflow rate from the low-flow structure 

(d) Ratios of inflow to outflow 

(e) Sizing of the overflow facilities 

(f) Stability of dikes 

(g) Safety features 

(h) Maintenance features 

 

For projects up to two hundred (200) acres, routing calculations shall be submitted in legible 

tabulated form with documented verification of adequacy according to scope and complexity 

of design. Proof of adequacy of volume of retention and sizing computations for low-flow 

structures shall also be submitted. Features of stability and safety may also need to be 

documented if the scope of the project requires special attention in this area of design. 

 

18-45 CONTROL STRUCTURES 

 

Detention facilities shall be provided with obvious and effective control structures. Plan 

view and sections of the structure with adequate detail shall be included in plans. 

 

Sizing the low-flow pipe shall be by inlet control or hydraulic gradient requirements. 

 

Low-flow pipes shall not be smaller than eight (8) inches in diameter to minimize 

maintenance and operating problems, except in parking lot and roof retention where 

minimum size of opening shall be designed specifically for each condition. 

 

The overflow opening or spillway shall be designed to accept the total peak runoff of the 

improved tributary area. 

 

Proper engineering judgment shall be exercised in analysis of secondary routing of discharge 

of greater intensity than the basic design storm in order to avoid economic losses or damage 

downstream. Review with twenty-five (25) and fifty (50) year frequency or greater is 

recommended. 

 

 

18-46 DISCHARGE SYSTEMS 

    

Sizing of the system below the control structure shall be for the total improved peak runoff 

tributary to the structure with no allowance for detention. 

 

When existing downstream pipe sizing, outside the developers control jurisdiction, is 

inadequate, an evaluation for under sizing of pipes may be undertaken by the City upon 

receipt of written request from the engineer specifying the run or runs desired to be 

undersized. 

 

Requests for under sizing shall be accompanied by plans and profiles of the entire undersized 

system downstream if less than five hundred (500) feet in length or a minimum of five 



 

 108 

hundred (500) feet. 

 

When hydraulic gradients of the proposed undersize system affect the performance or 

capacity of structures maintained by the City, no under sizing will be allowed. 

 

18-47 EASEMENTS 

 

Two (2) types of easements shall be provided in plans for detention facilities. 

 

18-48 MAINTENANCE EASEMENT 

 

All detention reservoirs with the exception of parking lot and roof detention shall be enclosed 

by a maintenance easement.  The limits of the easement shall extend ten (10) feet beyond 

the top elevation of the reservoir.   

 

When a detention reservoir is adjacent to a public right-of-way, the limits of the easement 

shall extend twenty-five (25) feet beyond the elevation of the reservoir on the public right-

of-way side. 

 

18-49 DRAINAGE EASEMENTS 

 

A minimum fifteen (15) feet wide drainage easement shall be provided within the reservoir 

area connecting the tributary pipes and the discharge system along the best possible routing 

of a piping system for possible future elimination of detention. 

 

18-50 MAINTENANCE OF DETENTION FACILITIES 

 

Detention facilities are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer installation and/or 

grading.  Since these facilities are intended to control increased runoff, they must be partially 

or fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation.   

 

Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed periodically from the 

detention area and control structure in order to maintain full storage capacity. 

 

The responsibility for maintenance of the detention facilities in new development 

subdivision projects shall remain with the developer until such time the maintenance 

responsibility is vested in the owner or Trustees of the subdivision. These maintenance 

requirements do not imply that any drainage structures or systems are or will become the 

maintenance responsibility of the City.  A letter from the owner/developer indicating 

responsibility for maintenance of all drainage structures or systems shall be submitted and 

shall become part of the official record which shall run with the land. 

 

When storm water detention storage is included in a site plan or subdivision plans, the owner 

must provide the City of Saraland with a plan for the maintenance of the detention facility.  

Said plan shall set forth the maintenance requirements of the facility and the party 

responsible for performing the maintenance.  No responsibility for repairs or maintenance is 

assumed by the City of Saraland.

 (d) Final Plan Approval:   

 

The following shall govern approval of a final plan: 

 

(1) The Planning Commission shall compare the final plan with the preliminary 

plan and with the standards set forth in this Article to assure that the final 

plan conforms to said standards. The Planning Commission may place 

conditions upon the granting of approval which, in its judgment, will ensure 

conformance to the plan as approved. 

 

(2) The approval of the final plan or any stage of it shall be valid for a period of 

one (1) year following the date of such approval.  

 

(3) Factors to be considered by the administrative staff and the Planning 

Commission in reviewing any Planned Unit Development are that the 

development is in harmony with the Comprehensive Plan and with the 

character of the neighborhood and will provide an overall density and 

standard of open space as required by this Ordinance. 

 

(4) The final plan or any stage of the Planned Unit Development shall not be 

approved if the average of the allowable dwelling units per acre, up to and 

including the stage which is to be approved, exceeds by more than ten percent 

(10%) of  the average number of dwelling units per acre which is allowable 

for the development. 

 

(5) A report of its findings and recommendations on a proposed Planned Unit

have recorded the subdivision plat in the manner designated by the 

Commission. 

 

 (e) Substantial Conformance: 

 

The determination of substantial conformance between the preliminary plan and the 

final plan shall be at the discretion of the Planning Commission.   

 

Variation in conformance is intended solely to facilitate the minor adjustments which 

may be necessary as the plans approach a final construction stage. The Commission 

may refuse to grant approval of substantial conformance if, in their opinion, the 

adjustments are being used to significantly modify the approved plan. 

 

 (f) Site Improvements: 

 

The developer, at his option, may place street improvements, sidewalks, utilities, and 



 

 151 

other permanent site improvements after preliminary plan approval or stake the 

location of the buildings and make application for building permits. Under no 

circumstances, however, will any building permit be issued until final approval has 

been granted and the necessary portions of the final plan recorded. The placing of 

improvements will not obligate the local government to approve such improvements 

on the final plan if not in conformance with the terms of this Article. 

 

 (g) Public Record: 

 

The final plan is the permanent public record of the Planned Unit Development and 

will be the manner in which the development is constructed as provided herein. 

 

 (h) Contents: 

 

The final plat shall contain, in final form, the information required above. In addition, 

the following will apply: 

 

If  parcels of land are to be sold, a subdivision plat on the forms prescribed by 

according to the criteria as set forth in Article XVII, Subdivision Review, and shall 

be filed for approval in the appropriate manner.

SECTION L 

TELECOMMUNICATIONS 

TOWER AND FACILITIES 

PROVISIONS 



 

 158 

ARTICLE XXXII 

 

 TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND FACILITIES PROVISIONS 

 

32-1 PURPOSE  

 

The intent of this Article is to establish minimum standards for wireless telecommunications 

facilities. The underlying principals of these standards are to:  

 

• Achieve a balance among the number, height, and density of wireless 

telecommunications facilities that are appropriate for our communities; and, 

 

• Encourage and maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings, and 

other structures to accommodate new wireless telecommunications facilities; and, 

 

• Ensure the compatibility of towers with, and avoid adverse impacts to, nearby 

properties; and, 

 

• Discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the City. 

 

32-2 DEFINITIONS  

 

• Accessory structure compound: A fenced, secured enclosure in which a wireless 

telecommunications facility and its equipment, buildings, access roads, parking area 

and other accessory devices/auxiliary structures are located. 

 

• Alternative support structure: Any structure other than a wireless 

telecommunications tower, which may include, but is not limited to, buildings, water 

towers, light poles, power poles, telephone poles, and other essential public utility 

structures. 

 

• Antenna: An electromagnetic device which conducts radio signals, through an 

attached cable or waveguide, to or from a radio transmitter or receiver. Typically this 

includes "whips,” "cornucopia horns,” "panels,” and parabolic "dishes.” 

 

• Antenna support structure: Any structure on which telecommunications antennas and 

cabling can be attached. Typically this includes steel towers with guy-wires (guyed 

towers); wooden, steel or concrete single poles (monopoles); self-supporting steel 

towers with three or four "legs" (self-supporting/lattice towers); rooftops of existing 

buildings or structures (such as elevated water storage tanks). (See Also Tower). 

 

• Co-location: The placement of more than one wireless communications antenna by 

one or more telecommunications service providers on a single existing or new 

antenna support structure. 

 

 Concealment techniques: Design techniques used to blend a wireless 

telecommunications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the 

existing surroundings so as to not have the appearance of a wireless 

telecommunications facility. Such structures shall be considered wireless 



 

 159 

telecommunications facilities and not spires, belfries, cupolas, or other 

appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for purposes of 

applying height such as building bulk, massing, and architectural treatment of both 

the wireless telecommunications facility and surrounding development. Concealed 

towers on developed property must be disguised to appear as either a part of the 

structure housing, a principal use, or an accessory structure which is normally 

associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed towers 

developed on unimproved property must be disguised to blend in with the existing 

vegetation. Example:  a tower of such design and treated with architectural material 

so camouflaged to resemble a woody tree with a single trunk and branches on its 

upper part, also known as a "monopine". 

 

• FAA: Federal Aviation Administration. 

 

• FCC: Federal Communications Commission. 

 

• Height: When referring to a tower or other structure, the distance measured from the 

ground level at the base of the tower to the highest point on the tower or structure, 

including if said highest point is an antenna placed on a structure or tower. 

 

• Tower: Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of 

supporting one or more antenna, including self-supporting lattice towers, guyed 

towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission 

towers, microwave towers, common carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, and 

the like (See Also Antenna Support Structure). 

 

32-3 PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS 

 

(a) Permitted Zones:  

 

Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be permitted by special exception in a 

B-2, General Business, district and by right in a C/I, Commercial/Industrial, district. 

Antennas located on existing towers (co-location antennas) and antennas located on 

alternative support structures shall be permitted by right. 

 

(b) Height:   

 

Antennas located on alternative support structures shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet 

in height above the existing structure on which they are placed. 

 

Tower height shall be limited to one hundred and eighty (180) feet. 

 

(c) Setbacks:  

 

Where a tower is permitted in a zoning district adjacent to any residential district, the 

required setback from all residentially zoned property lines shall be a distance equal 

to the height of the tower. 

 

(d) Co-location: 



 

 160 

 

To minimize adverse visual impact associated with the proliferation and clustering 

of telecommunication towers, co-location of facilities on existing or new towers shall 

be encouraged by: 

 

(1)  Only issuing permits to Qualified Shared Facilities at locations where it 

appears there may be more demand for towers than the property can 

reasonably accommodate; or, 

 

(2) Giving preference to Qualified Shared Facilities over other facilities and 

authorizing use at particular locations; 

 

(3) For a facility to become a Qualified Shared Facility. The facility owner shall 

show the following: 

 

(a)  The facility is appropriately designed for sharing; and, 

 

(b)  The facility owner is prepared to offer adequate space on the facility 

so others share fair and reasonable nondiscriminatory terms. 

 

(c) Co-location of communications antennas by more than one provider 

on existing or new telecommunications towers shall take precedence 

over the construction of a new single-use telecommunications tower. 

 

(d) For any telecommunications tower approved for shared use, the 

owner of the tower shall provide notice of the location of the 

telecommunication tower. 

 

(e)  No new antenna support structure shall be permitted unless the 

applicant demonstrates that no existing antenna support structure can 

accommodate the applicant's needs. 

 

(f) No signage, symbols, or advertisements may be attached to the pole, 

tower or antenna. 

 

(g) Monopole structures shall have the ability to accommodate at least 

one (1) additional set of antennas. 

  

Guyed structures and self-supporting towers shall have the ability to 

accommodate at least two (2) additional sets of antennas. 

 

(e) Aesthetics:   

 

The aesthetic properties of each individual wireless telecommunications facility shall 

be approved as part of the site plan review process. 

 

(f) Appearance:   

 

The design of the tower shall be of a type that has the least visual impact on the 

surrounding area. 



 

 161 

 

(1) Towers and antennas shall be painted a neutral or blending color so as to 

reduce visual obtrusiveness, unless subject to any applicable FAA standards. 

If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and 

supporting telecommunications facilities must be of a neutral color that is 

identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure. 

 

(2) No signage, symbols, or advertisements may be attached to the pole, tower, 

or antenna. 

 

(3) Towers camouflaged to resemble trees or indigenous vegetation in order to 

blend in with the native landscape shall be subject to administrative review 

as are types of concealment techniques. (See Concealment Techniques). 

 

(g) Accessory structures: 

 

(1) The design of the compound and its accessory structures shall, to the extent 

possible, maximize use of building materials, colors, textures, screening, and 

landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding 

natural setting and built environment. 

 

(2) In or adjacent to developed properties, accessory structures must be 

aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding 

environment. Materials such as wood, brick, and stucco should be 

appropriate. The use of metal or metallic looking materials shall be 

prohibited. 

 

(h) Non vegetative screening: 

 

(1) Non vegetative screening shall be required unless it is necessary to reduce the 

visual impact of a wireless telecommunication compound on adjacent public 

ways, properties, or the neighborhood in which it is located. 

 

In or adjacent to developed properties, non vegetative screening shall be 

provided in a manner compatible with the surrounding character of 

development, buildings, natural vegetation, and landscaping.  

 

Such screening, as required and subject to site plan review, shall have a 

minimum height of eight (8) feet, and may consist of one of the following:  

brick masonry walls, a fence of a solid appearance, berms, or opaque barriers. 

All non-vegetative screening shall be properly maintained by the property 

owner or lessor. 

 

(2) In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, 

such as remote, agricultural, or rural or heavily developed industrial areas, 

the non-vegetative screening requirement may be reduced. 

 

(3) Wireless telecommunications facilities utilizing underground vaults rather 

than above ground equipment buildings may be exempted from screening 

requirements. 



 

 162 

 

(i) Landscaping: 

 

(1) Landscaping will be required to reduce the visual impact of the compound 

and its accessory structures on adjacent public ways, properties, or the 

neighborhood in which it is located. In or adjacent to developed properties, 

landscaping shall be provided in a manner that is compatible with the 

surrounding character of development, buildings, and natural vegetation. 

 

(2) The perimeter of the compound shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant 

materials which effectively screen the view of the compound from adjacent 

property and public ways. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscape 

strip of at least five (5) feet in width outside the perimeter of the compound. 

In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the 

landscaping requirement may be reduced. 

 

(3) A row of trees a minimum of eight (8) feet in height and a maximum of ten 

(10) feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the compound fence. 

A continuous hedge at least thirty (30) inches in height at planting capable of 

growing to at least thirty-six (36) inches in height within eighteen (18) 

months shall be planted in front of the tree line. 

 

(4) All landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety. All landscaping shall be 

xeriscape tolerant or irrigated and properly maintained by the property owner 

or lessor to ensure good health and variety. 

 

(j) Lighting: 

 

(1) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other 

authority for safety purposes. If lighting is required, "dual lighting,” red at 

night/strobe during day, shall be preferred unless restricted by the FAA.  

 

Lighting must be shielded or directed upward to the greatest extent possible 

so as to minimize the amount of light that falls onto nearby properties or 

residential districts. 

 

(2) Basic security lighting for the compound may be permitted, but shall be 

focused only on the compound itself, and shall be directed away from any 

adjacent residential districts. 

 

(k) Environmental impact: 

 

All wireless telecommunications facilities shall comply with the National 

Environmental Policy Act. If an environmental assessment is required by the federal

accessory buildings are fully secured. Sufficient anti-climbing measures must 

be incorporated into each facility, as needed, to reduce potential for trespass 

and injury. 

 

(4) Obsolete towers:  

 

In the event the use of any wireless telecommunications facility has been 

discontinued for the period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, the wireless 

telecommunications facility shall be deemed to be abandoned.  

 

The determination of the date of the abandonment shall be made by the 

Building Official.  

 

Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the wireless 

telecommunications facility shall have an additional one hundred and eighty 

(180) days within which to reactivate the use of the wireless

requirements of this Ordinance. 

 

(f) Mandatory Compliance: 

 

Any nonconforming sign which is neither grandfathered nor permitted as a “legally 

nonconforming sign” according to Subsection (a) of this Section and which is   

prohibited under Section 33-6 of this Ordinance shall be removed or made to conform 

to this Ordinance within ninety (90) days of the date of adoption of this Ordinance. 

 

(g) Variance: 

 

The Board of Zoning Adjustment may, in extraordinary cases and for good reason, 

and where owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the 

actions of the applicant, permit the erection of a sign not in conformance with the

The Board, at its discretion, may require the posting of a bond in sufficient amount 

to protect the City of Saraland against all liabilities that may result from the erection 

and use of such sign. 

 

33-8 PERMITTING 

 

(a) Applicability: 

 

No person shall erect, alter, relocate, repair, replace the face of, or change a sign 

(except for billboards, which are governed by Section 33-5(o)(2)) in any way without 

first obtaining a permit, except for the following actions which shall not require a 

permit:  

 

(1) Cleaning, painting, or comparable maintenance of a sign that does not alter 

the size, image or message of the sign; 

 

(2) Erecting a sign for which a permit is not required in accordance with Section 

33-4 of this ordinance.  

 

(b) Procedure: 

 

All sign permits shall be issued in accordance with the following procedure:  

 

(1) An application, signed by the property owner or owner’s representative, shall 

be submitted to the Building Official, or his designee, for review and 

processing. The application shall include supplementary information as may 

be specifically requested by the Building Official, or his designee, to 

determine compliance with these regulations.  

 

(2) The Building Official, or his designee, shall review the application, plans, 



 

 183 

and specifications to determine whether the proposed sign conforms to all 

applicable requirements.  

 

(3) Following review and determination as to conformance with these 

regulations, the Building Official, or his designee, shall either approve or 

deny the application for the sign permit. Upon approval, the permit fee shall 

be paid before the permit may be issued.   

 

(4) An application may be amended within 30 days of the application date to 

include additional signage not to exceed the allowable maximum.  Additional 

fees shall be charged for additional signage added.  After 30 days, a new sign 

permit shall be required and all fees shall be reassessed based on the revised 

application.  
 

(5) Electrical Permit Requirement: 

 

All signs which are electrically illuminated shall require a separate electrical 

permit and inspection.  

 

(c) Submission requirements: 

 

No request for a sign permit shall be considered complete until all the following has 

been submitted to the Building Official, or his designee.  

 

(1) The application form shall be submitted with all required information 

completed by the applicant. The application form is available from the 

Building Official, or his designee.  

 

(2) Plans for the proposed sign shall be professionally designed and shall provide 

a graphic illustration or photograph.   Drawings shall be submitted, drawn to 

scale, and include the following: 

 

(a) Site plan showing the location of any easements, public rights-of-

way, utilities, property lines, buildings, freestanding sign(s) and other 

signs existing on the property or proposed on the property;  

 

(b) A listing of the number, type, location, and display area of all existing 

signs on the same property and/or building on which the sign is to be 

located.  

 

(c) Main entrance and/or front facade including linear dimension; 

 

(d) Dimensions, elevations, and messages of all signs on order to show 

compliance with the sign ordinance; 

 

(e) Dimensions of any supporting structures, including engineered

(f) Maximum and minimum height of proposed sign, as measured from 

finished grade; 



 

 184 

 

(g) For illuminated signs, indicate type and placement of illumination; 

 

(3) The applicant shall be required to pay a permit fee according to the current 

schedule of fees.  

 

(4) A sign permit shall be valid for a period of 6 months from the date of issuance 

of the permit. Failure to completely construct and erect the sign within the 

permitted time period shall void the permit and necessitate reapplication.  If 

construction of the sign is not in conformity with the ordinances of the City 

and with the submitted sign plans as determined by the Building Official, or 

his designee, the sign permit shall become void.

All signs shall be maintained in good condition and appearance.   

 

The Building Official, or his designee, after due notice in writing to the owner, may 

remove, at the owner's expense, any sign which shows neglect, which appears 

abandoned, dilapidated, or which has an area of a distance of ten (10) feet around 

such sign that is not kept free of weeds, rubbish, debris, or uncut grass, and 

maintained in compliance with City standards. 

 

(c) Vacation of Premises: 

 

Any sign associated with premises that have been vacated shall be either removed 

from the premises by the owner or lessee within three (3) months of the time of 

vacation, or said sign shall be altered or resurfaced by the owner or lessee within the 

same time period so that it does not display letters, numerals, symbols, figures, 

designs, or any other device for visual communication that would pertain to the 

activity formerly associated with the vacated premises.  Signs shall not remain void 

of face plates.  If face plates are removed, the property owner shall ensure that solid 



 

 185 

color blank face plates shall be immediately installed as temporary replacements 

until a new owner/lessee occupies the signage area. 

 

(d) Public Right-of-Way:

ARTICLE XXXV 

 

TABLE OF PERMITTED USES (DEFINED) 

 

TABLE OF PERMITTED USES:  The following Table contains a list of land uses permitted in 

each district.  Opposite each land use, in the appropriate district column or columns, the letter “R” 

identifies those districts in which a particular land use is permitted by right, subject only to Planning 

Commission site plan approval, and the letter “S” identifies those districts in which a particular land 

use is permitted only by Special Exception granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, and 

thereafter with site plan approval by the Planning Commission.  The letter “P” identifies those uses 

that must be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission as to location and site plan with 

regard to transportation, access, water supply, waste disposal, fire, police protection, and other 

public facilities. Review by either Board of Zoning Adjustment or the Planning Commission shall 

also include a determination by the Board or Commission that the use is compliant with the current 

City Comprehensive Plan. If no designation is listed for a use under a specific zoning district, the 

use is not allowed in that zoning district. The letter “A” identifies those uses that require 

Administrative Review pursuant to regulations stated in Article 31-1 of this ordinance. (Ord. 1063, 

11-10-16) 

 

USES NOT SPECIFIED:  In any case where a use is not specifically referred to by the Table or 

elsewhere in this Ordinance, its status shall be determined by the Building Inspector by reference to 

the most clearly analogous use or uses that are specifically referred to in the Table of Permitted 

Uses. When the status of a use has been so determined by the Building Inspector, such determination 

shall thereafter have general application to all uses of the same type.
