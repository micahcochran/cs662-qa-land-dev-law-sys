adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.

adoption of this Ordinance.

Map, such changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council.  No

6-11-1 Airport Zones

In order to carry out the provisions of this Ordinance, there are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath 
the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to Isbell Field. An area located in more than 
one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitations. The various zones are defined as 
follows: 



Page 35 of 51 

a. Runway 04 Approach Zone:  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide.
The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

b. Runway 22 Approach Zone:  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide.
The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

c. Transitional Zones:  The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.

d. Horizontal Zone:  The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways from the center end of the primary 
surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and
transitional zones.

e. Conical Zone:  The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward
therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.

Article VIII  Telecommunication Facilities

SECTION 8-1 PURPOSE 

In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the 
community, these regulations are necessary in order to (1) facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents and businesses 
of the City; (2) minimize adverse effects of towers through careful design and siting standards; (3) avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from 
tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements; and (4) encourage and maximize the use of existing towers, buildings and other 
structures to accommodate new wireless telecommunications antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community. 

SECTION 8-2 APPLICABILITY 

A. This Article shall not apply to antennas, towers and other supporting structures that are an accessory use on the premises where they are located,
including, but not limited to:

1. Television receiving antennas and dishes located on the premises of a dwelling, business or public facility, provided the signal is not re-
transmitted or sold off the premises.

1. Amateur radio broadcasting antennas

2. Radio transmission antennas located on the premises of a business or public facility, which is used for fleet or emergency communications.

3. Other antennas, towers and supporting structures, the sole purpose of which is accessory to the principal use of the premises, and not listed as
being subject to the terms of this Article in the following subsection (b).

B. This Article shall apply to antennas, towers and other supporting structures that are not an accessory use to the principal use of the premises, or which
are a separate business from the principal use of the premises, including, but not limited to:

Page 38 of 51 

SECTION 8-4  CAPACITY 

All telecommunication towers and associated compounds shall be designed to accommodate the antennas of at least three service providers. 

SECTION 8-5  MINIMUM LOT AREA AND SETBACKS 

A. Because of the unique nature of telecommunications facilities, minimum lot area shall be determined on an individual basis by the Board of
Adjustment as part of the conditional use process.

B. Towers shall be placed no closer than a distance equal to the height of the tower from any dwelling located in the Rural Farm District or residential
zoning districts.  However, because of the unique nature of telecommunications facilities, other required setbacks from property lines shall be
determined on an individual basis by the Board of Adjustment as part of the conditional use process.  The Board shall consider the following factors
when establishing minimum setbacks.

1. The type of telecommunications facility

2. Relationship to other properties and buildings

3. Relationship to the public right-of-way

4. Size of the subject lot or parcel

5. Accessibility for public safety and other purposes

SECTION 8-6 MONOPOLE TOWERS 

Only monopole towers may be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of a single family residential district boundary, the Central Business District 
boundary, any Historical District and Lookout Mountain Parkway. 

SECTION 8-7 AESTHETICS, LIGHTING AND BUFFERS 

A. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or subject to any applicable FAA standards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual
obtrusiveness.

B. The design of the buildings and accessory structures and uses shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping
that will blend the telecommunication facilities to the natural setting and built environment.

C. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and accessory uses and structures must be of a color that is identical to, or
closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible.

D. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority.  If lighting is required, the City may review the
available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.  Lighting must be shielded or
directed to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount of light that falls onto nearby properties, particularly residences.

E. No portion of any antenna array may extend beyond the property line.

F. Accessory buildings, cabinets and structures shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height, and shall be compatible with the surrounding area.

G. Tower compounds shall be surrounded by a buffer strip, as defined in Section XII of this Ordinance, in all cases where natural vegetation surrounding
the site is not sufficient to screen its view from any residence.

H. The City may require a special design of any telecommunications facility where findings of particular sensitivity are made.

SECTION 8-8 FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS 

All towers and antennas must meet or exceed the current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government 
with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.  If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by 
this Article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of 
such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.  Failure to bring towers and 
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owners 
expense. 

SECTION 8-9 BUILDING CODES AND SAFETY STANDARDS 

The owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes, the applicable standards 
for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended, and all applicable codes adopted by the City. 



Page 39 of 51 

A. In addition to any other applicable standards and requirements, the following shall apply to all towers and telecommunications facilities:

1. Sufficient anti-climbing measures must be incorporated into each facility to reduce potential for trespass and injury.

2. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing
device.

3. At least ten (10) feet of horizontal clearance must exist between any antennas and any power lines, unless more clearance is required to meet
Alabama Public Service Commission standards.

4. All towers and telecommunications facilities must be designed and/or sited so that they do not pose a potential hazard to nearby residences or
surrounding properties or improvements.  Any tower shall be designed and maintained to withstand without failure, the maximum forces
expected from wind,  hurricanes, and other natural occurrences, when the tower is fully loaded with antennas, transmitters, and other
telecommunications facilities, and camouflaging.  Initial demonstration of compliance with  this requirement shall be provided by submission of 
a report to the Building Official prepared by a structural engineer licensed in the State of Alabama describing the tower structure, specifying the
number and type of antennas it is designed to accommodate, providing the basis for the calculations done, and documenting the actual
calculations performed.  Proof of ongoing compliance shall be provided by submission to the Building Official at least every five (5) years of an
inspection report prepared by an Alabama registered structural engineer indicating the number and types of antennas and related
telecommunications equipment actually present, and indicating the structural integrity of the tower.  Based on this report, the Building Official
