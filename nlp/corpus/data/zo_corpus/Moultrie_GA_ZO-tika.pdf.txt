NON-CONFORMING USE: Any legal use of land or structures which does not 

conform to the use provisions of this Ordinance at the time of adoption or any 

amendment thereto.  * 

 
* This definition applies to the land uses in any particular zoning district which 

have a legal right to remain if they were being used prior to the adoption of the 

Zoning Ordinance, since zoning cannot be made retroactive.  For example: A 

NON-CONFORMING USE would be a grocery store located in a single family 

residential zoning district that does not apply to permit commercial uses, or a 

home located in a industrial zoning that does not permit residences.  This 

definition does not apply to building or structure which is permitted in a 

particular zoning district but which does not meet the Zoning Ordinance 

requirements for building height, yard setbacks, off-street parking space or other 

regulations. 

 

Likewise, a NON-CONFORMING USE is not an open air land use, such as a 

parking lot outside storage use, which may not meet the zoning district 

requirements for greenbelts or fencing, even though such an open air 

land use is permitted forthwith in the particular zoning district. 

 

To further clarify the definition of a NON-CONFORMING USE a building, 

which has a deficient front yard, but is a use of land permitted in the zoning 

district wherein it is located, is not a NON-CONFORMING USE but rather a 

conforming use with a deficient front yard.  However, should this building be 

expanded in the future, the new addition would have to observe the required front 

yard as specified in the Zoning Ordinance.

building.  A sloping grade, beginning at the sidewalk level, shall be maintained and 

established from the center of the front lot line to the finished grade line at the front of the 

building.  The rear and sided yards shall be sloped to allow for the flow of surface water 

away from the building without creating a nuisance.  However, this shall not prevent the 

grading of a yard space to provide sunken or terraced areas, provided proper means are 

constructed and maintained to prevent the run-off of surface water from creating a 

nuisance on the adjacent properties.  (Refer also to City Building Code.) 

 

When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two existing buildings or 

adjacent to an existing building, the reference level shall be used in determining the grade 

around the new building and the yard around the new building shall be graded in such a

structure shall be moved from the City from outside the City limits until such building 

permit has been secured.  Any such building or structure shall fully conform to all the 

provisions of this Ordinance in the same manner as new building or structure.

shall inspect same and shall determine if it is in a safe condition to be moved; whether it 

may be reconditioned to comply with the Building Code and other City requirements for 

the use and occupancy for which is to be used, and whether or not it will be of similar 

character with the buildings in the area where it is to be moved.  Also, clearances will be 

obtained from all utility companies insuring that utilities are discontinued and all 

facilities accounted for.  Special inspection fees may be charged to cover costs of

topsoil, gravel, rock, garbage, rubbish, or other wastes or by-products, is not permitted in 

any zoning district except under a certificate from, and under the supervision of the 

Building Department.  Such certificate may be issued in appropriate cases upon the 

furnishing of bond, by company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, 

running to the City in an amount as established by the Engineering Department which 

will be sufficient in amount to rehabilitate the property upon default of the operator of 

such excavating or filling operation, and to cover court costs and other reasonable 

expenses.  This regulation does not apply to normal soil removal for basement or 

foundation work when the Building Department has previously duly issued a building 

permit.  Costs of a permit to fill or excavated may be allocated to the Building 

Department to defray the City’s costs and in accordance with Section 19.06 of this 

Ordinance. 

 

Section 4.26.  RESTORING UNSAFE BUILDINGS.  Nothing in this Ordinance shall

construed as to interfere with the temporary use of any property as voting place in 

connection with a municipal or other public election.

In addition, the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1, OR M-2 District shall be screened 

from such contiguous residentially zoned district by either a building housing a 

permitted use or else by an ornamental masonry wall or chain link fence five (5) 

feet in height above grade, between said greenbelt areas and the commercial and 

industrial use in said C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1, OR M-2 District.  Such 

greenbelt shall be planted with deciduous trees, evergreens, flowering trees, 

and/or ornamental trees set not closer than six (6) feet to the fence or wall.

Where vehicles or open air display generally exceed a five (5) foot height, said 

wall or chain link fence shall be increased to a height not exceeding ten (10) feet, 

providing further that all such walls shall be of uniform height around the 

premises and the design of such wall is first approved by the Planning 

Commission. 

 

If, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the greenbelt would serve no good 

purpose, the Commission may waive such requirements and provide only the wall 

or fence between the residential and C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1, OR M-2 

Districts, provided it abuts a non-conforming use in a residential area.

District on which a drive-in business, open air display, commercial parking lot, or 

other open use is conducted shall be separated along its entire length from any 

adjacent residentially zoned district, located across a public alley of not less than 

twenty (20) feet wide, by either a building housing permitted use or by an 

ornamental masonry wall five (5) feet in height above grade located preferably, 

on the residential side of said public alley.  Greater wall height may be required in 

accordance with paragraph ―a‖ above. 

 

c. Waiver of Wall or Fence Requirement.  Where required walls or fences are 

provided on the business side of public alleys, wall, or fence requirements may be 

waived to provide necessary entrance to or exit from required off-street parking 

and loading areas, provided approval is secured from the Planning Commission as 

to suitability of width and location of such openings in said wall or fence. 

 

d. Adjacent Commercial or Industrial Property.  Where an R-3 Districts abuts 

directly upon a commercially or industrially zoned district, unless the requirement 

is already fulfilled by abutting property, a landscaped greenbelt shall be provided 

and maintained along its entire length by the users of the R-3 District.  Such 

greenbelt shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width and be deciduous trees, 

evergreens, flowering trees, and/or ornamental trees.

Prior to an amendment to the Zoning Map of the City of Moultrie, upon the request of an 

owner to prospective developer concerning all zones except R-1A, R-1B, R-PUD, and C-

compatibility with requirements of this Ordinance and may impose other special 

requirements on the plan it deems necessary in order to properly evaluate the proposed 

amendment.  As a minimum, the Planning Commission may require the following to be 

shown on the plan: 

 

a. The title under which the proposed development is to be recorded along with the 

present name of the owner. 

 

b. A topographic map showing the general location of existing property lines, 

streets, alleys, buildings, easements, water bodies, and other physical site features 

which relate to the development. 

 

c. The proposed method of water supply, sewage disposal, and storm drainage. 

 

d. All proposed uses of the property to be developed, including proposed locations 

of structures, streets, and refuse areas. 

 

e. Date, North Point, Scale. 

 

In the event of action on the request by the Planning Commission, subsequent approval 

thereof by the Mayor and Council shall constitute rezoning for such planned use only. 

 

Section 4.36.  Any building or manufactured building that is built for use in the City of

Section 4.38.  BED AND BREAKFAST HOMESTAYS.   

(Amended/Adopted by Council November 2, 2010—Ordinance #2010-88). 

It is the purpose and intent of the Mayor and Council that any Bed and Breakfast 

Homestay accommodations differ from apartments, apartment houses, lodging houses, 

boarding houses and rooming houses in that they are truly transient accommodations, 

with guests rarely staying more than a few days and enjoying at least a morning meal on 

the premises.  In addition, the owner or manager of a Bed and Breakfast Homestay must 

live on the immediate premises and must be present at all times guests are registered 

thereat or present on the premises.  The impact of a Bed and Breakfast Homestay will not 

be much greater than that of a private home with frequent house guests, with the 

exception of the parking demand. 

 a. Bed and Breakfast Homestays may only be permitted as a conditional use granted 

to the owner(s) thereof upon approval by the Planning Commission after application by 

the owner(s) or potential purchaser pursuant to a written contract of the premises 

proposed for use as such and the holding of a public hearing and the subsequent approval 

by the Mayor and Council upon finding that: 

  (1) The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance; 

  (2) The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of 

adjacent properties or the general neighborhood and will not effect adversely 

the health, peace, enjoyment and safety of area residents and businesses; 

  (3) The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the 

number of persons using the facility, vehicular movement, noise or fume 

generation, or the type of activity; 

  (4) The proposed use will not affect adversely the existing use(s) and the 

proposed use will be on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space 

requirements for said use; 

  (5) All required parking, development, building, and safety standards will 

be met at all times.  All parking will be on the premises or immediately 

adjacent thereto.  There will be only one parking space per guestroom plus 

one additional space to be utilized by the owner or agent thereof.  The owner 



 

Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011 

57 

or manager will at all times be domiciled on the premises and a resident 

thereof.  Further, the size and location of proposed parking areas will not have 

an adverse impact on adjacent properties or the surrounding neighborhood; 

  (6) No existing structures, which contribute to the character of the premises 

or neighborhood, will be removed in order to provide the required parking; 

  (7) The proposed number of rooms to be utilized for visitors in the structure 

will be compatible with the surrounding land area and is reasonable with 

respect to the size of the structure and the size of the lot on which the 

structure is located; 

  (8) The Bed and Breakfast Homestay will be located in a structure or in a 

combination of structures on a single lot which was originally constructed for 

use by a single-family or an inn and which has a minimum heated floor area 

of 2,500 square feet.  The addition of fire escapes, handicap ramps, and wider 

doorways may be permitted in order to meet building codes.  All 

modifications made will be in keeping with the exterior architectural detailing 

of the structure.  Alterations, which return the structure to its original 

appearance, may be permitted; 

  (9) Only one exterior sign not exceeding 8 square feet in area will be used; 

  (10) Breakfast will be served and individual guestrooms shall not contain 

cooking facilities.  Lunch and/or dinner may also be served.  All meals shall 

be served on the premises; 

  (11) Alcoholic beverages will not be sold, provided, dispensed, possessed or 

made available, by or to the owner, manager, any agent thereof or any guest 

except in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations; 

and, 

  (12) All Bed and Breakfast Homestays will be subject to and comply with 

the hotel/motel tax of the City of Moultrie. 

 b.  Required registration and reporting forms shall be obtained from the City of 

Moultrie. 

 c.  In addition to all other requirements and restrictions set forth herein, the Mayor 

and Council may impose such additional restrictions and require such additional 

standards as it deems necessary to protect the health, peace, enjoyment and safety of 

residents and businesses in the area and to protect the value and use of properties in the 

general neighborhood. 

 d.  Whenever the Mayor and Council find that the holder of any permit granted 

hereunder is not complying with any term, condition, or restriction under which the 

permit was granted, it may revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties 

concerned and granting full opportunity for a hearing.

applicant(s) at the time of application and shall be non-transferable, non-assignable, non-

delegable or alienable. 

 f.  A permit issued pursuant to this section shall be void and not subject to 

reinstatement except by new application at such time as the holder(s) thereof: 

  (1) Fail(s) to report or pay for the purposes of hotel/motel taxation for any 

period such that said reporting or payment is more than fifteen (15) days past due;

consecutive calendar months, or any portion thereof; 

  (3) Voluntarily surrenders the permit issued;  

  (4) Fails to hold or renew any other license or permit required; 

  (5) Elects in writing to be released from any term, condition or restriction 

required in the permit or any other requirement of a Bed and Breakfast Homestay; or, 

  (6) Ceases to have an ownership interest in the property upon which the 

Bed and Breakfast Homestay is located. 

 g.  No entity shall advertise in any form or media, or promote, refer to, designate 

or utilize the term ―Bed and Breakfast‖ unless such entity holds a valid permit pursuant to 

this section. 

 h.  No activities or may be conducted on the premises unless all the premises and 

activity is in compliance with all other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, 

and zoning requirements and all appropriate licenses and permits are issued and 

maintained.   

 i.  In the event additional activities or special events are permitted pursuant to 

preceding subsection (h) they shall be subject to the following restrictions: 

  (1) Hours shall be limited to the following hours: 

 

   i. 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. each day, Monday through Thursday; 

   ii. 8:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. each day, Friday through Saturday; 

   iii. 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Sunday; and, 

   iv. 8:00 a.m. New Years Eve to 1:00 a.m. New Years Day; 

 

  (2) At least one off-duty law enforcement officer must be present for traffic 

and crowd control for up to each seventy five (75) persons present on the 

premises; and, 

 

  (3) The number of persons present on the premises remains in compliance

 j.  Any violation of the provisions of this article regarding Bed and Breakfast 

Homestays, or any other violation of any ordinance contained in this Code relating to Bed

Any lawful use of the land or buildings existing at the date of the passage of this 

Ordinance and located in a district in which it would not be permitted as a new use under 

the regulations of this Ordinance is hereby declared to be a ―non-conforming use‖ and not 

in violation of this Ordinance at the date of adoption of this Ordinance; provided, 

however, that a non-conforming use shall be subject to, and the owner shall comply with, 

the following regulations:  

 

Section 5.01.  CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.  At any time after the adoption of 

this Ordinance, should the City become aware of a non-conforming use, the owner of said 

non-conforming use shall be notified by the Building Inspector of the provisions of this 

Section, and that his property constitutes a non-conforming use. 

 

Section 5.02.  NON-CONFORMING USE OF LAND, CONTINUATION OF USE.  
The non-conforming use of land, where no building or structure is involved, which exists 

when this Ordinance becomes effective, may be continued provided that: 

 

a. No such non-conforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended 

either on the same or adjoining property. 

 

b. If such non-conforming use of land or any portion thereof is discontinued or 

changed, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of 

this Ordinance. 

 

c. Any sign, billboard, commercial advertising structure, or similar object which 

lawfully existed and was maintained at the time of this Ordinance became 

effective may be continued, although such use does not conform with the 

provisions of this Ordinance; provided further, that all such non-conforming 

signs, billboards, commercial outdoor advertising structures and objects, and their 

supporting members located in R-1, R-2, and R-3 Districts, shall be completely

or amendments thereto. 

 

Section 5.03.  CHANGE.  A non-conforming use may be changed to another non-

conforming use of the same or greater restrictions provided no structural changes are 

made in the building.  Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a 



 

Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011 

60 

conforming use, or to use a permitted in a district of greater restriction, it shall not 

thereafter be changed to non-conforming use. 

 

Section 5.04.  EXTENSION PROHIBITED.  A non-conforming use may not be 

extended throughout other portions of the building.  If such non-conforming use or 

portion thereof is discontinued or changed to a conforming use, any future use of such 

building or portion thereof shall be in conformity to the regulations of the district in 

which such building is located. 

 

Section 5.05.  MOVING.  No non-conforming use or non-conforming building may be 

removed to any other part of a parcel of land upon which same was conducted at the time 

of the adoption of this Ordinance.

such work is done. 

 

Section 5.07.  RESTORATION.  Any building which houses a non-conforming use 

which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, Act of God, or by public enemy 

to the extent of fifty (50%) percent of its market value-exclusive of the foundation at the 

time such damage occurred- shall thereafter be made to conform with the provisions of 

this Ordinance.  If such damage is less than fifty (50%) percent of its market value before 

said damage occurred, exclusive of the foundation, then such structure may be restored to 

the same non-conforming use as existed before such damage, provided that such 

restoration shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Said 

restoration shall be commenced within one (1) year of the date of such partial destruction 

and shall be diligently carried on to completion.

structure to the regulations of the various districts defined in this Ordinance; and the 

removal of such use or structure. 

 

The Planning Commission shall submit its reasons and estimates of cost and expenses of 

such acquisition and the removal of the non-conformity, and of the probable resale price 

of the property to be acquired after removal of the non-conformity as obtained from the 

appropriate City department, Board or Commission.  The Planning Commission shall 

recommend that portion of the difference between the estimated cost of acquisition and 

removal of the non-conformity, and the probable resale price which, in their opinion, 

should be assessed against a benefited district. 

 

Whenever the City Council has under advisement the acquisition by purchase, 

condemnation or otherwise as provided by law of any such non-conforming building, 

structure or use, a preliminary public hearing thereon shall be held before that body; 

provided that not less than fifteen (15) days notice of time, place, and purpose of such 

public hearing shall first be published in a paper circulating in the City of Moultrie and

of assessment; the names of the respective owner of the property in such district, and the 

addresses thereof in the last assessment roll. The City Clerk shall also send to the said 

respective owner the tentative assessment.

proceedings be instituted for the acquisition of any non-conforming building, structure or 

use in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, and the Charter of the ordinances 

of the City of Moultrie, the City Clerk shall send by registered mail a certified copy of 

such resolution to the respective owners of the properties and to the owners of the 

properties in any special district at the addresses given in the last assessment roll. 

 

Upon the passing of title in the private property so acquired to the City of Moultrie, the 

City Council shall cause the discontinuance or removal of the non-conforming structure.  

The City Council shall thereafter order such property sold or otherwise disposed of, but 

only for a conforming use.  The City Council shall confirm the cost and expense of such 

project and report any assessable cost to the City Assessor who shall then prepare an 

assessment roll in the manner provided for in the Charter and the ordinance of the City of

Moultrie.  Such an assessment roll may, in the discretion of the City Council, be in one or 

more, but not to exceed five (5), annual installments. 

 

Section 5.12.  Classification B-1, B-2, B-3, and B-4 shown on the Zoning Map dated

R-PUD RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

DISTRICT 

 
Section 10.01.  RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.  It 

is the intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable 

flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure, or group of 

structures, which includes multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of 

more than one building on a given site.  The requirements of the area, height, bulk, and 

placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and 

individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development results 

affording less protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if a measure of 

flexibility were permitted.  The permitting of these planned unit developments as special 

and particular land use can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to 

the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse 

effects on adjoining properties. 

 

Therefore, the Zoning Ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk, and placement 

may, in the Planned Unit Development District, be modified by the Planning Commission 

in the case for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the Planning 

Commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, 

education, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in 

no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed 13.5 dwelling 

units per acre and provided further that the minimum site size for the residential planned 

unit development is three (3) acres. (NOTE: Density amended by Ordinance #143, dated 

2/19/74) 

 

Within the Residential Planned Unit Development District, the following regulations 

shall apply: 

 

Section 10.02.  PERMITTED USES.  In all R-PUD Districts, no building or land, 

except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, shall be erected or used except for one or 

more of the following specified uses: 

 

a. Multiple dwellings, including apartment houses, row, or town house dwellings. 

 

b. Community garages serving the principal residential building, containing space 

for no more than two (2) passenger vehicles for each dwelling unit in the principal 

building on the lot. 

 

c. Maintenance and management buildings to serve the multiple dwellings. 

 

d. Private swimming pools designed and operated only for occupants of the principal 

multiple dwellings and their personal guests. 

 



 

Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011 

87 

e. Signs when located on the same lot pertaining to the use of the particular building 

or buildings, provided they shall not overhang any public right-of-way; shall not 

be illuminated; shall not exceed twelve (12) square feet in area; shall not project 

higher than one story or twenty (20) feet above the level of the ground, whichever 

is lower; and shall not indicate any information except the name or address of the 

building or management thereof. 

 

f. Community buildings in the nature of club houses, libraries, reading rooms, 

community facilities, such as laundry rooms and wash rooms and entertainment 

centers provided that all of the uses listed in this section are designed and 

operated only for the occupants of the multiple dwellings which are the principal 

buildings and their personal guests. 

 

g. Mobile home parks, provided that the density of the proposed mobile home park 

shall not exceed ten (10) dwelling units per acre and provided further that the 

minimum size of the proposed mobile home park shall be not less than five (5) 

acres, and meet design standards as approved by City Council. 

 

h. Accessory buildings and uses as defined in ARTICLE II of this Ordinance. 

 

i. Off-street parking and loading in accordance with requirements of ARTICLE VI. 

 

j. Only those uses specifically permitted in this section shall be allowed in an R-

PUD District.  In order to clarify the type of permitted uses, the following uses, 

among others, are Specifically Prohibited. 

 

1. Rental offices, as accessory to a multiple dwelling, row or town house 

dwelling, or efficiency unit projects. 

 

2. Tourist home lodging house or boarding home. 

 

3. Motel or hotel. 

 

Section 10.03.  PRELIMINARY REVIEW.  Preliminary review is recommended as an 

aid to both the developer and the City.  Under this procedure, a developer provides the 

information, which is described below, and the Planning Commission then acts on the 

information provided.  This review is intended to then serve as a guide for the immediate 

inspection of the Planning Commission, subject to a thorough study and analysis.  

Changes and additions, which may have to be made before a mutual agreement is 

reached, can be made at such time without excessive engineering cost to the developer.

R-TH, TOWN HOUSE DISTRICT 
 

 

Section 10-A.01.  TOWNHOUSE DISTRICT.  A town house development contains 

elements that are characteristic of both single-family and multi-family communities.  

Allowable density is comparable to that of multi-family dwellings, while the subdivision 

of land permits the sale of individual structures and lots.  In permitting construction of 

town houses, the City Council intends: 

 

a. To encourage home ownership in the City of Moultrie. 

 

b. To increase the variety of dwelling types that are available to the local housing 

market. 

 

c. To encourage redevelopment of small parcels of property in older areas of the 

City. 

 

Section 10-A.02.  PERMITTED USES. 

 

a. Accessory uses and structures incidental to any permitted use. 

 

b. Customary home occupations. 

 

c. Signs and outdoor advertising in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning 

Ordinance. 

 

d. Community facilities including electric transformer station, gas regulator station, 

or telephone exchange, private golf courses and club houses, neighborhood 

recreation centers, or swimming pools, non-commercial or lodges or public uses. 

 

e. Town houses. 

 

f. Private and public schools. 

 

Section 10-A.03.  AREA, HEIGHT, BULK, & PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS. 

 

a. In accordance with the attached Schedule of Regulations, ARTICLE XVIII. 

 

b. In addition to the requirements stated in ARTICLE XVIII, all town house 

developments in the R-TH zone must comply with the following additional 

standards:  

 



 

Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011 

95 

1. A town house shall be located on a site that measures a minimum of one-half 

acre in area. 

 

2. Each interior town house lot shall be at least 24 feet in width.  Each town 

house lot located on a corner shall be at least 49 feet in width.  Each interior 

ton house lot that is intended to be at the end of a row of town houses shall be 

at least 34 feet wide. 

 

3. The set back from an interior side lot line shall be a minimum of 10 feet and 

from a street lot line shall be a minimum of 25 feet for the town house which 

is located at the end of a row of town houses. 

 

4. An accessory building may abut an accessory building located on an adjacent 

lot in the Town house district. 

 

5. On sites that equal or exceed one (1) acre in area, a town house development 

shall not exceed seven (7) dwelling units (lots) per net acre.  Net acreage 

excludes land area devoted to street and alley right-of-way, and holding 

ponds. 

 

6. No more than four (4) town houses shall be built in a row having the same 

building line.  In setting forth this requirement, the City Council intends to 

discourage the creation of long unbroken lines of town houses.  In a town 

house complex having more than four (4) dwelling units, the required 

minimum offset in the building line shall be three (3) feet.  A row or grouping 

of town houses shall not exceed 250 feet in length. 

 

7. Every town house lot shall front on a public street. 

 

8. No more than one (1) single-family residence shall be located on a town house 

lot.

prepared in accord with all requirements of the Subdivision Ordinance.  The 

plat shall be submitted to the Moultrie/Colquitt County Planning Commission 

for its review and approval. 

 

10 a. Two paved off-street parking spaces shall be provided for each town 

house. 

 

 b. The off-street provided for a town house may have direct access to an 

alley only if the alley has a minimum pavement width of twenty (20) feet 

and a minimum right-of-way width of thirty (30) feet.  When a town house 

subdivision will occupy a portion of a block, the developer shall pave the 

alley to whichever intersecting street is lower elevation, relative to its lots.

front yard of major thoroughfares as shown on the City’s major 

thoroughfare map if a setback of 50 feet is maintained and on other streets 

if a setback of 35 feet is maintained and the front yard properly landscaped 

as determined by the Planning Commission.  Otherwise, parking shall be 

in the rear.  The minimum setback in all instances shall be 35 feet. 

 

11. Fire wall construction for a town house shall extend from the foundation to 

and through the roof.  The wall shall be an 8-inch fire rated masonry wall.

existing commercial use so long as the primary use of the premises is for commercial business uses 

and that the residential use is secondary.  In permitting construction of residential uses on

a. To encourage the growth of family owned and operated business and the development of 

commercial planned residential and commercial use of the downtown area in the City of 

Moultrie.

ARTICLE XIV 

 

C-PUD, COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

 
Section 14.01.  COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.  It is the 

intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in 

design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include one 

or more retail sales, service and office enterprises on a single parcel of land in the form generally 

known as a ―one stop shopping center.‖ 

 

In the case for a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the Planning 

Commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for pedestrian and vehicular 

circulation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, the application of the 

usual requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement is not intended within the Planned Unit 

Development.  The application of these usual restrictions in certain large-scale developments may 

have results affording less protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if this is intended 

measure of flexibility were permitted.  The intent of this district is to increase the desirability and 

convenience to the users of the development without causing adverse effects on the adjoining 

properties. 

 

The minimum size of a Commercial Planned Unit Development District is 4 acres. 

 

Within the Commercial Planned Unit Development Districts, the following regulations shall apply: 

 

Section 14.02.  USES PERMITTED 

 

1. Automobile car wash establishments. 

 

  

2. Automobile service stations in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.06. 

 

  

3. Bake shops, provided that at least 75 percent (75%) of all baked goods produced on 

the premises are sold at retail on said premises 

  

4. Barber shops. 

  

5. Beauty shops. 

  

6. Banks. 

 

7. Bicycle rental or repair shops. 

 

8. Billiard halls. 

 

9. Carpet, rug, linoleum, or other floor covering stores.

ARTICLE XV 
 

DESIGN STANDARDS FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT 
(Adopted 2/18/03) 

 

Section 15.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.  Design standards for commercial development 

established in this article are intended to visually indicate proximity to downtown by keying off of 

the historic commercial and industrial styles present in town, to maintain the character of the rural 

highway experience with informal architecture, required building setbacks, and landscaping while 

allowing for flexibility in design, and to re-establish, promote, and/or preserve the rural landscape.  

The intent of the district also is to implement further the following policies of the Comprehensive 

Plan: To further identify scenic views and determine strategies for retaining such areas, to protect 

viable and stable neighborhoods from uses not in keeping with their established character and use, to 

guide commercial growth and development should to commercial clusters and away from strip 

development, and to encourage the strategic development of the East By-Pass (a.k.a. Veterans 

Parkway) in order to maintain its integrity as a major U. S. Highway. 

 

Section 15.02 APPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS.  The design standards for commercial 

development shall be applicable to all commercial zones- C-1, C-1R, C-1T, C-2, C-2R, C-3, C-3R, 

C-4, C-PUD.  In the C-1, C-1R, C-1T, C-2, and C-2R Districts, the standards of Building Zone 1 as 

established in the criteria of Section 15.05 shall apply in order to protect viable and stable 

neighborhoods from uses not in keeping with their established character.  In the C-3, C-3R, C-4, C-

PUD, the standards of Building Zone 1 or Building Zone 2 as established in the criteria of Section 

15.05 shall apply to allow greater flexibility in the design options, since such districts typically are 

oriented towards major thoroughfares and outside of neighborhoods. 

 

Section 15.03 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF PERMIT.  At the 

time of submission of building plans for plan review for building permit approval, the applicant shall 

submit detailed architectural drawings demonstrating compliance with the design standards.  No 

plans shall be accepted without drawings in sufficient detail to allow Community Development and 

planning staff to assess compliance.  Within ten- (10) business days, the Community Development 

and Planning Director, or his/her designee shall review the architectural drawings and determine if 

the proposed design complies with the standards established in Section 15.05.    

 

If the proposed design does not meet the standards, the Community Development and Planning 

Director, or his/her designee, shall submit to the applicant in writing via certified mail with return 

receipt the standards with which the proposed design does not comply.  The applicant shall have ten 

(10) business days from receipt of the notification to resubmit architectural drawings demonstrating 

compliance with the standards.  Failure to resubmit architectural drawings within the specified time 

period will result in denial of the application for a building permit.  The applicant shall have the right 

to appeal the decision of the Community Development and Planning Director, or his/her designee, to 

the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission only after the applicant has resubmitted 

architectural drawings in accordance with the process above and the Community Development and 

Planning Director, or his/her designee, has determined the revised drawings do not comply with the 

design standards.

3R, C-4, C-PUD subject to the standards of this article and the regulations set forth in the Schedule 

of Regulations, ARTICLE XIX, shall continue to be permitted in compliance with the standards of 

this article. 

 

Section 15.05 DESIGN CRITERIA.  (Amended by Ordinance #2008-39 on June 3, 2008) 

 

a. Building Zones 

 

Commercial developments shall meet the criteria of the building zones in which they are 

constructed.  Figure 15.A depicts the building zone divisions.  The purpose of the two 

different building zones is to provide flexibility in development options along major 

thoroughfares.  The following standards shall define the building zones.  Where there 

may be conflicting requirements, the standards shall supersede the Schedule of 

Regulations in Article XVIII:

b. Development Options 

 

For the purposes of this article, commercial development shall be classified into two (2) 

categories:  (1) Individual businesses with single and shared accesses and (2) Limited access 

business clusters.   

 

(1) In order to provide a functional and aesthetically desirable arrangement of 

buildings, parking, and landscaping, commercial developments in the fist category 

shall be designed as in Figure 15.B or in a similar manner to meet the intent of 

these standards. 

 

(2) In order to provide a functional and aesthetically desirable arrangement of 

buildings, parking, and landscaping, commercial developments in the second 

category shall be designed as Figure 15.C or in a similar manner to meet the intent 

of these standards. 

 

c. Landscaping and Buffer Zone Standards 

 

(1) Sites without trees on site.   

 

Business developed within Building Zone 2 shall be required to plant a 50 feet wide 

strip of native vegetation in front of their building and parking facilities to buffer the 

view from the road.  Business signage would be allowed to be placed to be visible 

from the road.  Trees shall be planted in a randomized 10’ x 10’ grid fashion.  Costs 

can be mitigated by planting seedlings or by planting fewer, but larger specimens. 

 

(2) Sites with trees on site. 

 

All trees in the 50 feet wide buffer strip shall be preserved.  New planting may be 

necessary and shall be required to meet the density of a 10’ x 10’ randomized grid 

planting.  Any trees removed for a building site shall be replaced on site. 

 

d. Architectural Standards 

 

The goals of the architectural standards are to encourage an informal character of the rural 

highway experience in undeveloped corridors of the City of Moultrie, to preserve the context and 

character of the City of Moultrie, and to encourage creativity and high quality design and 

construction.  The concepts that serve as the basis for the architectural standards are to: 

 

(1) Locate new construction within the designated building zones.

128 

(2) Group businesses when possible into informal clusters to appear as ―farm units.‖ 

 

(3) Restrict height to preserve rural appearance. 

 

(4) Make buildings pedestrian friendly at street level. 

 

(5) Draw upon existing architectural styles that are easily translated into contemporary 

designs. 

 

(6) Use existing commercial and industrial buildings in Moultrie for design ideas. 

 

(7) Not imitate historic styles that can appear ―fake.‖ 

 

(8) Provide extra amenities that promote good environmental practices. 

 

In order to achieve the above goals and implement the above design concepts, new commercial 

development shall meet the following design standards as applicable: 

 

(1) Building Orientation 

 

(a) Buildings shall be oriented towards the commercial corridor that abuts it. 

 

(b) The building shall be oriented to clearly demarcate and allow pedestrian entry and 

access into the building. 

 

(c) The building shall be oriented to allow for the location of parking in accordance 

with paragraph ―a‖ of Section 15.05. 

 

(2) Setbacks 

 

(a) New construction shall be located only in the building zones defined in paragraph 

―a‖ of Section 15.05. 

 

(b) Setbacks shall determine the degree of flexibility in architectural standards.  New 

construction in Building Zone 1 shall meet all of the architectural standards 

established in this subsection.  New construction in Building Zone 2 shall be 

subject to less stringent architectural standards contingent upon meeting the buffer 

requirements of Section 15.05.c. 

 

(3) Scale 

 

(a) Buildings shall be intimately scaled to provide a pedestrian friendly atmosphere.  

Scale shall be determined by the distance across a space in relationship to 

surrounding buildings.  The distance to height ratio shall not exceed four (4). 

 

(b) The scale of new buildings shall be compatible with neighboring buildings. 



 

Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011

(4) Massing 

 

(a) Buildings over 5,000 square feet in Building Zone 1 shall be broken up to look 

like multiple buildings rather than one large ―box.‖  Figure 15.D illustrates a 

possible arrangement for buildings over 5,000 square feet. 

 

(b) The massing of buildings shall be varied to add interest to the structure.  This 

shall be achieved by varying the horizontal and vertical planes of the exterior 

walls and varying the height of distinct elements.  Figure 15.E illustrates desirable 

versus undesirable elements.

(5) Rhythm 

 

(a) Openings, such as windows and doors, materials and textures, and architectural 

features shall be used to visually ―break up‖ the walls. 

 

(b) The window/door opening solid to void ratio shall be 50% wall to 50% window or 

door openings on the first floor and 70% wall to 30% window or door openings 

on upper floors within Building Zone 1.  The Community Development and 

Planning Director may approve a 60% wall to 40% window or door openings on 

the first floor in Building Zone 1 if the applicant provides information that the 

variation in the ratio will maintain the existing character of the area in which the 

building is to be located.

(c) The window/door opening solid to void ratio shall be 60% wall to 40% window or 

door openings on the first floor and 80% wall to 20% window or door openings 

on upper floors within Building Zone 2.  The Community Development and 

Planning Director may approve a 70% wall to 30% window or door openings on 

the first floor in Building Zone 2 if the applicant provides information that the 

variation in the ratio will maintain the existing character of the area in which the 

building is to be located. 

 

(6) Materials 

 

(a) The type of external materials used shall consist of one or two primary materials 

and textures.  Required wall materials in Building Zone 1 and desirable wall 

materials in Building Zone 2 shall include brick, wood siding (weatherboard or 

board and batten), cementuous fiber board siding, cast concrete block with 

texture, and non-synthetic stucco.

FOOTNOTES TO ARTICLE XVIII. 

 

SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS. 

 
a. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.  The requirements of area, height, bulk, and 

placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of 

record, would in certain cases of large-scale developments have results affording less 

protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were 

permitted.  The permitting of these planned unit developments as special exceptions can, 

in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of 

the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties.  

 

Therefore, the Zoning Ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk, and placement 

may be modified by the Planning Commission in the case for a plan of a large-scale 

development which, in the judgement of the Planning Commission, provides adequate 

open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air, and service 

needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the 

proposed planned unit development exceed that of the Zoning Ordinance requirements, 

and provided further that the minimum site size for residential planned unit development is 

three (3) acres and commercial planned unit development is four (4) acres. 

 

b. In the M-1, M-2, and AG Districts, publicly owned buildings, public utility buildings, 

telephone exchange buildings, electric transformer stations and substations and gas 

regulator stations necessary for the provision of essential services to the area by 

governmental units or public utilities will be permitted on lots having the minimum area, 

width, yard, and coverage requirements set forth in the R-1 District of this Ordinance. 

 

c. Semi-detached dwellings constructed in R-2 or R-3 Districts shall have a minimum lot 

area of 20,000 square feet.  Multiple dwellings constructed in R-2 or R-3 Districts shall 

comply with the following regulations: 

 

Lot Area-10,000 square feet for the first dwelling unit plus the additional lot area 

requirements as follows: 

Type of Dwelling Unit Minimum Additional Lot 

Area In Square Feet 

Minimum Floor Space In 

Square Feet 

Efficiency Unit 800 350 

One Bedroom Unit 1,000 600 

Two Bedroom Unit 1,500 800 

Three Bedroom Unit 2,000 1,000 

Each Additional Bedroom 200 150 

 

d. In all residential districts, the width of side yards, which abut upon a street on the same 

side on which other residential lot front, shall not be less than the required front yard 

setback for, said other residential lots.  All buildings, structures, and accessory uses shall 

maintain such required yard space.

nearby permitted uses, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, 

smoke, or lights.
