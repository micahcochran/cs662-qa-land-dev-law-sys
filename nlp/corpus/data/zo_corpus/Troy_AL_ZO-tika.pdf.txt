Section 1.3 Official Zoning Map 

The City is hereby divided into zones, or districts, as shown on the Official Zoning Map which, together with all 
explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this Ordinance.

and bearing the seal of the City under the following words:  “This is to certify that this is the Official 
Zoning Map of the City of Troy, Alabama,” together with the date of the adoption of this

other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Official 
Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the City Council, with an entry 
on the Official Zoning Map as follows:  The new boundary line shall be drawn and within the newly

ARTICLE FOUR 

NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND, NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, NON-
CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES, AND NON-CONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE 

Section 4.1 Continuance of Non-Conforming Uses 

Within the districts established by the Ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist 
lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this 
Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms 
of this ordinance of future amendment.  It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to 
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.  It is further the intent of this Ordinance 
that non-Conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding 
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 

4.11 Extension of Non-Conformities:  Non-conforming uses are declared by this Ordinance to be 
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a 
non-conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use of structure and land in combination shall 
not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment of a building or 
premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the 
district involved. 

4.12 Construction Prior to Adoption:  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be 
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which 
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of 
this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. 

 4.121 Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in 
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. 

 4.122 Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been 
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal 
shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on in 
accordance with Section 4.121 within thirty (30) days of adoption of this Ordinance. 

Section 4.2 Non-Conforming Lots of Record 

In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory 
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this 
Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance.  Such lot must be in 
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.  This provision 
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally 
applicable in this district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area 
or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations or the district in which such lot is located.  
Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment. 

4.21 If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single 
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part 
of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, such lands shall be 
able to change ownership, and be constructed upon. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, by 
variance, reduce or waive the yard requirements on non-conforming lots where enforcement of 
the yard requirements would create an excessively small or narrow building area.  The Board shall, 
in its deliberation on an appeal for a variance, take into consideration typical existing yards in the 



Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 5 | P a g e  

 

general area where the non-conforming lot is located, giving particular attention to existing uses 
and setbacks on adjacent properties. 

Section 4.3 Non-Conforming Uses of Land 

4.31 Extension of Non-Conforming Use:  No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor 
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or 
amendment of this Ordinance. 

4.32 Relocation of Non-Conforming Use:  No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in 
part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of 
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. 

4.33 Discontinuance of Non-Conforming Use:  If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any 
reason for a period of more than 120 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the 
regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 

4.34 Additional Structures: No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this 
Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land. 

Section 4.4 Non-Conforming Structures 

Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance that could 
not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its 
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long 
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 

4.41 Extension of Non-Conforming Structure:  No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or 
altered in a way which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be 
altered to decrease its non-conformity. 

4.42 Replacement of Non-Conforming Structure:  Should such non-conforming structure on non-
conforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means exceeding its full value above 
foundation for tax purposes, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions 
of this Ordinance or under hardship conditions as a Special Exception as defined under Section 
8.512 and 8.513. 

4.43 Relocation of Non-Conforming Structure:  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any 
distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is 
located after it is moved. 

Section 4.5 Non-Conforming Uses of Structures or Structures and Premises in Combination 

If a lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structure and 
premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance, that would 
not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it 
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 

4.51 Extension of Non-Conforming Use of Structure:  No existing structure devoted to a use not 
permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, 
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the 
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 

4.52 Extension of Non-Conforming Use:  Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any 
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such at the time of adoption or 



Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 6 | P a g e  

 

amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such 
building. 

4.53 Change to Non-Conforming Use:  In changing a non-conforming use to another non-conforming use 
the Board of Adjustment shall render such decisions only if the following conditions are satisfied: 

4.531 Change shall be permitted only by Special Exception under the provisions of Section 
8.512 or 8.513. 

4.532 The applicant must show that the non-conforming use cannot reasonably be changed to 
a permitted use. 

4.533 The application shall show that the proposed change must be less objectionable in 
external effects than the existing non-conforming use with respect to: 

1. Traffic generation and congestion including truck, passenger car, and 
pedestrian traffic. 

2. Noise, dust, smoky glow, fumes, vapors, etc. 

3. Storage and waste disposal. 

4. Appliances. 

 4.534 The proposed use is a permitted use in one (1) or more zoning districts. 

4.54 Establishment of Conforming Use:  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on 
which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the 
regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 

4.55 Discontinuation of Non-Conforming Use: When a non-conforming use of structure, or structure and 
premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months or for 18 
months during any three-year period (except when government action impedes access to the 
premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used 
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 

 4.56 Elimination of Non-Conforming Mobile Homes:  When a non-conforming mobile home is moved 
from its site, or upon violation of any other applicable ordinance requiring vacating the mobile 
home as a residence, shall be considered grounds for elimination of the non-conformity.  In those 
instances where a non-conforming mobile home is vacant for six (6) consecutive months or nine (9) 
months in any two-year period, it shall not be occupied again and the non-conformity shall be 
removed. 

4.57 Elimination of Non-Conforming Status of Land:  Where non-conforming use status applies to a 
structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the 
non-conforming status of the land.  Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as 
damaged to an extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 

Section 4.6  Repairs and Maintenance of Non-Conforming Structures 

On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use, work may be 
done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of the non-
bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of the current replacement cost of 
the non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that 
the cubic content existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased. 



Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 7 | P a g e  

 

4.61 Unsafe Structures:  If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-
conforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance and 
is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, 
it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of 
the district in which it is located. 

4.62 Restoration of Safe Conditions: Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the 
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe 
by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 

Section 4.7 Uses Under Special Exception Provisions Not Non-Conforming Uses 

Any use which is permitted as a Special Exception in a district under the terms of this Ordinance (other than a 
change through Board of Adjustment Action from a non-conforming use to another use not generally 
permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a non-conforming use in such district, but shall without further 
action be considered a conforming use.

property is not zoned for patio homes or is not a permitted use in the 
adjacent zoning district.

side yard, or open space. Accessory structures shall be permitted in the 
rear yard and shall not exceed one and one-half (1 ½) stories in height;

25% coverage for accessory structures, but shall not exceed 600 square 
feet in area; shall not be placed in any required front, side, or street side

6.14 Principal Buildings and/or Structures: It is the intent of this Ordinance that there shall be but one 
main building and/or structure plus any permitted accessory buildings and/or structures on a lot 
except as follows: 

6.141  Rear Dwellings: No accessory structure or building in the rear of the principle building 
on the same lot may be used for residential purposes unless upon approval of a special 
exception by the Board of Adjustment. No special exception shall be granted that would 
permit, multiple residential structures that would violate the single-family occupancy on 
any RR, R1, or PH-50 lot. 

6.141   Multi-Family Developments: In any district where multi-family structures are permitted, 
two or more such residential structures may be permitted on a lot provided that such 
placement of multiple structures shall meet all required setbacks and no building shall 
be located closer to another building on the same lot than a distance equal to half the 
sum of the heights of both buildings. In addition, the front or rear of any building may 
be no closer to the front, rear, or side of any other building than 30 feet. The side of any 
building shall be no closer to the side of any other building than 15 feet. 

6.142  Non-Residential Developments: Lots in non-residential zoning districts may contain 
more than one main building or structure, but such placement of multiple structures 
shall meet all required setbacks and lot area required for each structure and shall be 
harmonious in relationship of the buildings and uses both within the site and in relation 
to adjacent uses. In addition, the front or rear of any building may be no closer to the 
front, rear, or side of any other building than 30 feet. The side of any building shall be no 
closer to the side of any other building than 15 feet. 

6.143  Orientation: The front face of all buildings constructed at the front building line shall be 
oriented toward a public street, as the principal entrances. For multi-family or non-
residential structures only, in the event that the building is wider than the width of the 
lot, the side of the building constructed at the front building line may be oriented 
toward a public street. In no event shall the rear of any building constructed at the front 
building line be oriented toward a public street. 

6.144 Site Plan Approval:  For developments requiring site plan review and approval in Section 
6.5, site plans are to be submitted in accordance said section. Furthermore, the Building 
Official or Planning Administrator may request site plan review and approval by the 
Planning Commission before construction for all land development that can be expected 
to have a significant impact on City services, natural resources, traffic patterns, and on 
adjacent land usage.   

6.145  Exceptions: Nothing herein, permits multiple structures or multi-family uses in districts 
requiring special exceptions for such use without Board of Adjustment approval or in 
districts where prohibited.

occupy more than 30% of any required rear yard. Accessory buildings shall be at least 
five (5) feet from all lot lines and from any other building on the same lot. 



Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 48 | P a g e  

 

6.152 No accessory buildings, not an integral part of the principal building, shall be located 
within 60 feet from the front lot line. 

6.153 In the case of a corner lot adjoined in the rear by a lot facing the side street, the 
accessory structure shall be located in such a manner as to conform with the front and 
side yard requirements of the adjoining lot. 

6.154 Swimming and wading pools with a depth of one (1) foot or more in any portion of the 
pool, and not located within a permanently and completely walled structure, shall be 
contained no closer than ten (10) feet of any property line and shall be completely 
fenced off from the ground up to a height of at least five (5) feet. Gates and fences shall 
be so constructed and of such materials so as to prevent the entry of children into the 
pool area. Gates shall be provided with adequate locking devices and shall be locked at 
all times when the pool is not in use. 

6.16 Access to Public Streets: 

6.161 In residential, commercial and industrial districts, every use, building or structure

standards specified in this section upon a finding that the proposed exceptions are desirable from 
the standpoint of privacy and/or security, will not be detrimental to neighborhood appearance or 
character, and will not be detrimental to traffic safety.

face abutting property or street right of way.  If any fence, other than chain link, only 
runs along the side or sides of the front yard without a connecting front fence line, then 
the fence shall be double-faced (ie. having a “face” as described above on both sides) 
and still remain an open fence, with no less than fifty (50) percent of the fence area left 
unobstructed by opaque materials.

A home occupation is intended to be a use conducted in a residential property, with operations 
occurring entirely within a dwelling and carried on solely by the inhabitant thereof and which is clearly 
incidental and secondary to the use of the building and/or structure for dwelling purposes. Because the 
City recognizes that certain home occupations have greater land use impacts than others, this article is

clearly explain the scope of the business to ensure the proper regulations are administered. 

May be permitted on appeal in the RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, A-1, MHR, and the MH Districts only when 
approved as regulated in this Section. 

The City Clerk, zoning administrator, building official, revenue officer, and/or a person designated by 
the City council, shall have the right to enter and inspect the dwelling for compliance purposes 
following advance notice to the property owner. 

No article or service shall be sold, offered, or performed which must be performed on the property 
outside of structures complying with the provisions of this Ordinance.  



Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 62 | P a g e

home occupation; nor shall there be any sign advertising the home occupation. No advertising display 
signs shall be permitted. No commercial telephone directory listing, newspaper, or local or city 
directory, radio, television, website, social media, billboard, or any other electronic or written 
advertising shall be used to advertise the location of a home occupation to the general public.  

The operation of a home occupation shall not involve any potentially dangerous or deadly weapons of 
any kind, including but not limited to knives, firearms, or air guns. 

The appearance of the dwelling unit shall not be altered, nor shall the home occupation be conducted 
in any way that would cause the premises to differ from its residential character and that of the 
immediate neighborhood. 

No more than one home occupation shall be approved in any residential dwelling unit. 

The operation of a home occupation shall not create any nuisance, including, but not limited to 
excessive traffic, on-street parking, noise, vibration, glare, odor, fumes, dust, heat, fire hazards, 
electrical interference or fluctuation in line voltage, and shall have no effect or impact upon the 
physical and natural amenities of the neighborhood or affect the residents’ ability to maintain the 
quiet enjoyment of their homes, property, streets, and neighborhood. 

Any grant of approval for a home occupation shall be deemed a privilege and requires the continual 
compliance with all rules, regulations and conditions applied to the approval. 

A home occupation shall not include a furniture upholstery, retail store, repair shop, health clinic, 
hospital, barbershop, beauty parlor, tearoom, animal daycare and/or hospital, chiropractic clinics, 
fortune telling establishments, automobile washing or detailing, or other similar activity as determined 
by the Board of Adjustment. The on-site repair of vehicles shall be prohibited as a home occupation.

Section 6.5 Site Plan Review and Approval 

It is recognized by the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Troy that there is a value to the public in establishing 
safe and convenient traffic movement to higher density sites, both within the site and in relation to access 
streets; that there is value in encouraging harmonious relationship of buildings and uses both within a site and 
in relation to adjacent uses; further that there are benefits to the public in conserving natural resources. 
Toward this end, by the Zoning Ordinance the Council has requested site plan review by the Planning 
Administrator for all land development that can be expected to have an impact on natural resources, traffic 
patterns, and on adjacent land usage. 

Site Plans shall comply with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws, codes, regulations, ordinances,

Site plan approval is required before application and issuance of any building or applicable permits, 
but shall not constitute approval of such permit. It is the intent of this Section that the approved 
site plan be an integral part of the building permit application process, and that the site plan shall 
be the instrument by which improvements to the site will be constructed and inspected prior to 
occupancy of the development.

manufactured home parks / developments, retirement or assisted-living facilities, nursing homes, 
recreational vehicle park developments, multi-family structures, and developments with more than

Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 78 | P a g e  

 

 Except as otherwise required by law or administrative procedures, all required county, regional, 
state or federal agency approvals shall be obtained prior to the submission of an application for 
Site Plan Review. At his/her discretion, the Planning Administrator may waive this requirement in 
whole or in part to allow the processing of permit applications at various other levels of 
government to proceed concurrently with Site Plan Review.  

 The site plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Administrator and may be referred for review and 
report by other City departments and appropriate officials.  The review will take into consideration 
the requirements set out in this Ordinance and may also take into consideration compliance with 
all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws, codes, regulations, and ordinances.  

 The Planning Administrator may refer any site plan to the Planning Commission for its 
consideration and approval. 

 The Planning Department shall notify the applicant of the approval or disapproval of the site plan. 
In the case of approval, specific changes, if any, required to be made shall be stated. If such 
changes require alterations to the site plan, the Planning Administrator may require such site plan 
to be resubmitted for site plan review and approval once said alterations are incorporated.    

6.55 Site Plan Content: The site plan shall contain all information as reflected on the current Planning 
Departmental check list for a site plan, which said check list may be modified at the discretion of 
the Planning Administrator, when applicable. 

 For development sites of one (1) acre or more, full engineering drawings must be submitted by an 
engineer registered in the State of Alabama. At the Planning Administrator’s discretion, the same 
requirement may be applied to sites of less than one (1) acre where the Planning Administrator 
determines that the plan proposes uses or activities that may have a substantial impact on 
surrounding properties. The Planning Administrator may require additional information deemed to 
be appropriate or necessary for proper review. 

6.56  Standards for Site Plan Review: The following criteria, where applicable, may be considered in 
determining whether to approve a site plan: 

1. Completeness of application information as required; 

2. Compliance with the Comprehensive Plan; 

3. Uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this Ordinance; 

4. Whether the site plan meets applicable design and development standards established by 
this Ordinance; 

5. Availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development, such as 
roads, sewer, water, schools, solid waste disposal, and fire protection (including access to 
the site for emergency vehicles);  

6. Adequate provisions for surface and stormwater drainage; and 

7. Compatibility with surrounding land uses. 

6.57  Approval of Site Plan:  Site plan approval is required before application and issuance of any 
building or applicable permits, but shall not constitute approval of such permit. Upon final approval 
of a site plan, no structures, uses, or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development 
site except in accordance with the site plan and related approved plans.  Upon approval of a site 
plan, the Planning Administrator shall stamp, sign and date the site plan, then forward a copy of 



Troy, Alabama Zoning Ordinance, as amended February 13, 2018 79 | P a g e  

 

the approved site plan to the Building Department noting such approval with any noted conditions 
or stipulations. 

 Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction 
drawings to the Building Official for permitting. 

 Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Building Department from accepting for review and 
processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical, electrical, and 
plumbing systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions as may be 
established by that department relative to processing of site plans prior to final approval. 

 In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a site 
plan approval and such approval is on file in the Building Department. All building and construction 
permits issued for any project requiring site plan review shall be consistent with the approved site 
plan. The approval of a site plan shall not under any circumstances be construed to waive or 
otherwise diminish the applicable City requirements for construction or installation of structures or 
materials. Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such construction details occurs, the 
more restrictive or that requiring the higher standard shall prevail. 

6.58 Expiration of Site Plan Approval: Approved site plans shall remain valid for eighteen (18) months 
after final approval, and a building permit for the development may be obtained during that time 
period, if all other requirements of this Ordinance have been met.  

 The Planning Administrator may make one extension of site plan approval for a single period up to 
six (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire. An extension may be 
granted if the Planning Administrator concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded 
with due diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to 
warrant a new application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less 
than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the approved site plan stating the reason for the time 
extension request. 

 Requests for any extension in excess of the one six (6) months extension shall not be granted. 
Instead, the applicant shall submit a new application for review in accordance with the procedure 
provided in Section 6.5 of this Ordinance. 

6.59 Amendment, Revision of Site Plan:  A site plan, and site plan approval, issued thereon, may be 
amended upon the request of the applicant. Such amendment shall be made upon application and 
in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 6.5 of this Ordinance.

Council may place conditions upon the granting of approval which, in its 
judgment, will ensure conformance to the Plan as approved.  

  2. The approval of the final plan shall be valid for a period of one (1) year 
following the date of such approval. At its discretion, the Council may extend 
final plan approval for an additional six (6) month period. 

    3. Factors to be considered by the City staff, the Planning Commission and the 
Council in reviewing any planning unit development are that the 
development is in harmony with the Land Use Plan and with the character of 
the neighborhood and will provide an overall density and standard of open 
space as required by this Ordinance.

not be approved if the average of the allowable dwelling units per acre, up to 
and including the stage which is to be approved, exceeds by more than ten 
percent (10%) of the average number of dwelling units per acre which is 
allowable for the entire planning development. 

  5. Upon final approval and after all conditions have been met, the Council shall 
approve the recording of the final development plan in the deed records. 
When no parcels are to be sold, the developer will process and have 
recorded the subdivision plat in the manner designated for the City. 

  6. The determination of substantial conformance between the preliminary plan 
and the final plan shall be at the discretion of the City. Variation in 
conformance is intended solely to facilitate the minor adjustments which 
may be necessary as the plans approach final construction stage. The Council 
may refuse to grant approval of substantial conformance if, in their opinion, 
the adjustments are being used to significantly modify the approved Plan.

sidewalks, utilities and other permanent site improvements after preliminary plan 
approval or stake the location of the buildings and make application for Building 
Permits. Under no circumstances, however, will any Building Permit be issued until final 
approval has been granted and the necessary portions of the final plan recorded. The 
placing of improvements will not obligate the local government to approve such 
improvements on the final plan if not in conformance with the terms of this section. 

 12.189 Public Record:  The final plan is the permanent public record of the planned 
development and will be the manner in which the development is constructed as 
provided herein.
