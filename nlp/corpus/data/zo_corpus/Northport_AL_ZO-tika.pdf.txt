ORDINANCE NO.    1779  
 

AN ORDINANCE in pursuance of the authority granted by Title 11, Chapter 52, Articles 
1 through 4 inclusive, of the Code of Alabama 1975, As Amended, to provide the 
establishment of districts within the corporate limits of the City of Northport, Alabama; 
to regulate within such districts the height, bulk, number of stories and size of buildings 
and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be developed, the size of yards and 
other open spaces, the density and distribution of population and the use of buildings, and 
structures.  Further regulated is the use of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, 
agriculture, forestry, conservation, airports, water supply, sanitation, protection against 
floods, public activities, and other purposes, creating districts for said purposes and 
establishing the boundaries thereof.  Provisions are further provided for changes in these 
regulations, restrictions and boundaries for above mentioned districts. 
Said Ordinance shall repeal all existing Zoning Ordinances and provide methods for 
administration of this Ordinance and penalties for the violation thereof.  
THE PUBLIC WELFARE REQUIRING IT, be it ordained by the City Council of the 
City of Northport, as follows: 
 
ARTICLE I. TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION.  
 
Section 100. Title. This Ordinance shall be known as and may be referred to as the 
“Northport Zoning Ordinance,” and includes maps of the City that depict the boundaries 
of zoning districts.  
 
Section 101. Legislative Intent.  
In enacting the Zoning Ordinance, special notice has been taken of the fact that the goals 
of citizens and landowners of Northport often conflict or compete. In the light of this 
situation, the first consideration has been to devise technical solutions, which minimize or 
eliminate conflicts.  
This Ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate both competing interests. 
This has inevitably, and properly, led to some form of compromise. In arriving at these 
compromises, every possible consideration has been given to the public interest, 
individual property rights, and externalities. While compromise implies mutual 
concessions or losses, it also implies – and this Ordinance has been designed to provide – 
mutual gains and benefits. It is the goal of this Ordinance that both the burdens and the 
benefits it implies are rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property 
owners of Northport.

Every effort has been made to make uses a matter of right subject to performance criteria 
capable of nondiscretionary, objective administrative evaluations, thus reducing the 
number of times that rezoning decisions need be made. This greatly increases the 
potential uses or choices available to individual property owners. The rezoning decisions 
that conventional zoning ordinances frequently necessitate appear to reduce the certainty 
of protection to neighbors and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to Northport. 
This Ordinance contains performance criteria intended to insure that neighbors are 
protected from adverse impacts. The Ordinance also contains performance criteria to 
protect the community’s general welfare. Zoning districts are few in number, and each 
has a clearly different purpose. The districts are sized to be adequate to handle 
Northport’s long-term needs and must be regularly updated as time passes. Where 
performance criteria severely limit the use of properties, the Ordinance has gone to 
considerable extremes to provide the landowners with a range of choices, flexibility, and 
options for development. 
 
Section 102. Purpose.  
The purpose of this Ordinance is the promotion of the health, safety, and general welfare 
of the present and future inhabitants of Northport by:  
A. Providing methods to preserve and maintain a healthful environment for the benefit of 
present and future generations by providing standards to control the amount of open 
space and impervious surfaces within a development; to control the intensity of 
development in areas of sensitive natural resources or natural features in order to reduce 
or eliminate adverse environmental impacts.  
B. Controlling and regulating the growth of Northport, concentrating development in 
areas where adequate sewerage facilities, roads, and schools can be provided, and 
limiting development in areas where these facilities are not and should not be provided.  
C. Regulating and restricting the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for 
trade, industry, residences, and other uses.  
D. Providing standards for all types of dwelling units so that all the people may have 
access to decent, sound, and sanitary housing in accordance with the goals of the Federal 
Housing Act of 1949, among which is the provision of adequate zoning to meet a fair 
share of the region’s housing needs.  
E. Lessening the danger of congestion of traffic on the roads and highways, limiting 
excessive numbers of intersections, driveways, and other friction points, minimizing 
other hazards, and insuring the continued usefulness of all elements of the existing 
highway system for their planned function.  
F. Securing safety from fire, panic, flood, and other dangers.  
G. Providing adequate privacy, light, and air.  
H. Securing economy in local governmental expenditures.

I. Conserving property values throughout Northport.  
J. Protecting landowners from adverse impacts of adjoining developments.  
K. Dividing the incorporated area of Northport into districts according to the use of land 
and buildings, the intensity of such uses (including bulk and height), and surrounding 
open space. 
Each purpose listed above serves to balance the interest of the general public of Northport 
and those of individual property owners.  Decisions made through the application of this 
Ordinance shall be made in conjunction with the Northport Comprehensive Plan. 
 
Section 103. Jurisdiction. 
This Ordinance shall apply to all areas within the corporate limits of the City of 
Northport, Alabama.

Mobile Home Park    MHP 
This is a “carryover” zone which will be shown on the map for existing mobile 
home parks; however, no new areas will be created in this district.  Existing parks  
may continue as they exist, but may not be enlarged.  All new manufactured home 
developments will fall under the criteria for Manufactured Home Subdivisions 
covered as a Conditional Use in an appropriate Residential District. 

 
Downtown/Riverfront Districts:  The zoning criteria for the areas of Northport 
described in the Northport Downtown/Riverfront Master Plan and its associated 
Northport Core City Zoning & Design Standards are a separate and distinct document 
adopted by Ordinance #1688.  For ease of access, the Zoning & Design Standards are 
depicted in this document as Article VII.  If desired, the entire Downtown/Riverfront 
Master Plan document may also be acquired separately. 
 
Section 302. Map of Zoning Districts.  
Zoning districts established by this Ordinance are bounded and defined as shown on the 
Official Zoning Map of Northport, which, together with all explanatory materials 
contained thereon, is hereby made a part of this Ordinance. 
 
Section 303. Interpretation of District Boundaries.  
In the event of uncertainty with regard to their location, it is the duty of the Planning 
Director, or his/her designee, to interpret the location of the zoning district boundaries.  
Where a district boundary line divides a lot held in single and separate ownership at the 
effective date of this ordinance, the Planning Commission shall determine, based on 
findings of fact from the Planning Director, the disposition of said boundary line. 
 
The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any zone boundary 
shown on the Official Zoning Map of Northport: 
 
303.01. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the limits of any 
municipal corporation shall be construed as following such limits.  
 
303.02. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, streets shall be 
construed to follow the centerlines of such streets.  
 
303.03. Boundary lines which follow, or approximately follow, platted lot lines or other 
property lines as shown on the Northport Tax Maps shall be construed as following such 
lines. 



March 21, 2018 
 

III-3 

303.04. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, section lines, half-
section lines, or quarter-section lines shall be construed as following such lines.  
 
303.05. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, railroad lines shall 
be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines. 
 
303.06. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, shorelines of any 
lakes shall be construed to follow the mean high waterlines of such lakes, and, in the 
event of change in the mean high waterline, shall be construed as moving with the actual 
mean high waterline. 
 
303.07. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerlines of 
streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as 
following the channel centerline of such water courses taken at mean low water. In the 
event of a natural change in the location of such streams, rivers, or other watercourses, 
the zone boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.  
 
303.08. Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, 
any of the features listed in paragraphs 303.01 through 303.07 above shall be construed to 
be parallel to, and at such distances from, such features as are shown on the map. 

 
Section 304.  Maintenance of Official Copy of Zoning Map. 
At least one official copy of the zoning map shall be maintained in the office of the City 
Planner, upon which shall be recorded, after the passage thereof, every amendment to this 
ordinance which effects a change in any zoning district boundary.  Such official copy of 
the zoning map shall be attested by the City Administrator/Clerk, and shall be available at 
all times for inspection by the general public. 
 
The City Planner may distribute copies of the zoning map to the general public and other 
officials, for reference purposes.  However, the official copy of the zoning map 
maintained in the office of the City Planner, plus official records of the City 
Administrator/Clerk regarding actions of the City Council to amend district boundaries 
shall constitute the only official description of the location of zoning district boundaries, 
and persons having recourse to this ordinance for any purpose are hereby so notified.

Section 305. Statement of Purpose and Intent of Zoning Districts. 
The following sections specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established 
by this Ordinance. 
 
305.01. Agricultural District (AG). This District is intended to protect and preserve 
areas of Northport which are presently rural or agricultural in character and use. The 
standards developed for these areas are designed to permit development compatible with 
the preservation of their rural character and agricultural use, while not permanently 
foreclosing future development. 
 
305.02. Residential Single Family Districts (RS). These Districts are intended to 
preserve the character of existing neighborhoods and developments under construction at 
the time of adoption of this Ordinance. It is designed to prevent these neighborhoods and 
subdivisions from becoming nonconforming under the terms of this Ordinance. This 
District is also intended to provide for future development of land where a Residential 
District is deemed the most appropriate zoning classification, and a preliminary or final 
plat for development of the land has been approved by the Planning Commission. It is 
also intended to provide for in-filling of existing neighborhoods on vacant lots with 
dwellings of like kind as defined in Section 203 of this Ordinance. 
 
Occupancy in RS zones is limited to “Family” as defined in Section 203. 
 
Certain structures and uses required to serve governmental, educational, religious, 
noncommercial, recreational, and other needs of such areas may be permitted as outright 
or as conditional uses within such districts, subject to restrictions and requirements 
intended to preserve and protect the single-family residential character of the districts. 
 
305.03 Residential Multi-Family (RM).  These districts are intended as medium and high 
density residential areas permitting progressively higher population densities, characterized by 
single-family detached, two-family detached, multiple-family structures, garden type 
apartments, and high-rise apartments. Certain structures and uses required to serve 
governmental, educational, religious, noncommercial, recreational, and other needs of such 
areas are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and 
requirements intended to preserve and protect the residential character of the district.   
 
305.04. Commercial Districts (C).   Northport has three (3) Commercial District 
designations:  C-2 Neighborhood Commercial; C-3 General Commercial; C-6 Highway 
Commercial. 



March 21, 2018 
 

III-5 

The regulations for theses Districts permit future development consistent with the 
existing character of commercial development within each. Such fixed and stable areas 
will be allowed to continue to exist, and develop further, under the general regulations 
governing the design, and construction of an approved site plan. 
 
305.05. Office-Institutional District (O-I).  This district is intended to provide areas for the 
development of public, semi-public and private offices; schools, healthcare and child care 
facilities; places of worship and special residential development.  Such uses are supportive of 
the surrounding residential community and should gain access via an arterial or major 
collector road. 
 
305.06. Manufacturing District (M). This District is intended to accommodate 
commercial areas that must be segregated, because of negative impacts that cannot be 
made compatible with other uses through the application of performance standards. The 
creation of this separate District for manufacturing/industrial use recognizes not only 
nuisances, but also infrastructure and operational incompatibilities between its permitted 
uses and those of other districts. Accordingly, the standards for this District are designed 
to accommodate intensive industrial uses that generate nuisances, which either cannot be 
handled by technology or which are nearly impossible to police. Location criteria for this 
district focus on transportation, requiring that sites have access to a railroad, an airport or 
a major highway.  
 
305.07. Special District.  Special districts are hereby authorized for the purpose of providing 
optional methods of land development, which encourages imaginative solutions to 
environmental design problems and provide for a mixture of uses and density of uses with 
associated open space and amenities.  Areas so established shall be characterized by a unified 
building and site development program providing for coordinated open space and 
architectural treatment. The special districts authorized by this Article are also intended to 
provide means for the establishment of uses, which are generally considered to be 
incompatible with most other land usage.  
 
305.08. Flood Protection Areas.  It is the intent of the flood protection area to provide 
protection in the floodway and flood fringe from the hazards and losses caused by flooding to 
residences, businesses, industries and public uses and to protect the natural flood 
environments that might be increased or significantly altered by improper use or 
development. 

 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
in its “Flood Insurance Study” and the “Flood Insurance Rate Map” and any revision thereto 
are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.  
 



March 21, 2018 
 

III-6 

The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable for 
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods 
can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or 
natural causes.  This Ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood 
hazard, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages.  
This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of Northport or by any officer or 
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any 
administrative decision lawfully made there under.   
 
305.09. Downtown/Riverfront Districts.  
The Downtown/Riverfront Master Plan was developed to provide a collective vision for how 
the areas within its boundaries should develop in the future.  The preservation of natural and 
historic resources as well as the compatibility of future development with historic 
development patterns is crucial to maintaining the overall character and charm of Downtown 
Northport.   
 
The Plan’s Zoning & Design Standards are depicted in this document as Article VII for ease 
of access. These Zoning & Design Standards are intended to help implement the Plan for the 
“Core City”.  Six (6) districts and fourteen (14) sub-districts, or zones, which reflect the 
plan’s intended primary land uses, physical form and development character are created by 
the Standards. 
 

 
305.10.  Carry Over Zones.  
 
Mobile Home Park (MHP).  This is a “carryover” zone which will be shown on the map for 
existing mobile home parks; however, no new areas will be created in this district.  Existing 
parks may continue as they exist, but may not be enlarged.  All new manufactured home 
developments will fall under the criteria for Manufactured Home Subdivisions covered as a 
Conditional Use in an appropriate Residential District.

ARTICLE IV.     GENERAL REGULATIONS  
   
 
Section 400.  Introduction.   
 
The purpose of the regulations contained in this Article is to allow maximum utilization of land 
while insuring against detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the 
public interest.  This insurance is provided by separating the incorporated area of the City of 
Northport into various zoning districts and permitting specified land uses within each, provided 
that a use meets all the additional criteria specified in this Ordinance.  This regulatory approach 
has been termed “performance zoning,” because it permits a use to be developed on a particular 
parcel only if that use meets “performance” standards, which have been enacted to insure against 
the use causing, or having the potential to cause, the negative impacts mentioned above.   
 
The format of the regulations in this Ordinance, and particularly in this Article, differs somewhat 
from that of traditional zoning ordinances, because performance zoning requires that 
consideration be given to site parcel characteristics and the range of impacts that any land use 
may have. 
 
 
Section 401.  Use Regulations.   
 
Section 402 specifies which uses are permitted in each zoning district and defines the use 
categories used in this Ordinance.  The purpose of this Section is to indicate which land uses may 
locate in each zoning district and which uses may not locate therein.  A further distinction is 
made between uses that may locate in a given district only upon obtaining a conditional use 
permit to do so.  The uses generally described in Section 402 are specifically listed in Sections 
404 through 408.   
 
Section 402.  Uses Permitted by Right, Uses Permitted with Conditional Use Permits, and 
Uses Not Permitted. 
 
Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Ordinance, no building, structure, or land shall be 
used or occupied except in the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in this 
Section.  The general use categories specified by Table 4-1 are defined in Sections 404 through 
408.   
 
Uses permitted by right or as a conditional use shall be subject, in addition to use regulations 
contained in this Ordinance, to all performance criteria and other regulations governing yards, lot 
size, lot width, building area, easements, provisions of off-street parking and loading, and to such 
other provisions as are specified in other Articles herein.  In particular, the laws of the State of 
Alabama and the regulations of the Tuscaloosa County Department of Health regarding water 
supply and waste disposal shall be adhered to.  Further, no permits shall be issued until approval 
is obtained from the Tuscaloosa County Department of Health for water supply and sewage 
disposal, unless the premises are served by public water and/or sewage facilities.     
 



May 10, 2021 

IV-2 

  
 
All permitted uses and uses requiring conditional use approval pursuant to Section 1003 are 
listed in Table 4-1.  In addition, the table notes uses for which special development standards 
apply, regardless of whether such uses are designated as permitted or conditional.  Special 
development standards are listed in Section 409. 
 
A use listed in Table 4-1 in any district denoted by the letter “P” is a use permitted by right, 
provided that all other requirements of State law and this Ordinance have been met and provided 
that a zoning certificate has been issued in accordance with Article X.  A use listed in Table 4-1 
denoted by the letter “C”, may be permitted as a Conditional Use in any district, provided that 
the requirements of Article X have been met.

In addition to Table 4-1, the following regulations regarding permitted uses are established:   
 
A.  Existing garage apartments in the Residential (RS), Residential/Commercial/Institutional 
(RCI), and Historic Neighborhood (HN) Districts are permitted uses and may be improved 
within the existing structure, but there shall be no increase in the number or size of dwelling 
units in the structure.  No new garage apartments are permitted in any district in the City.  When

Section 410.  Resource Protection Standards    
 
A.  All development shall be preceded by the identification of any environmental or natural 
feature described below and shall meet the specified standards for environmental protection.   
 
B.  Site alterations, re-grading, filling and clearing or planting vegetation prior to approval of the 
plans for development shall be a violation of this Ordinance.  Reference in this section to “open 
space” is intended to mean the term as it is defined by Article II and described in Section 415.   
 
C.  Perennial Streams –  50’ from top of stream bank on either side shall remain undisturbed 
unless otherwise permitted by the City Engineer.   
 
D.  Steep slopes.   
 

1. Areas with slopes of 33 percent (3:1) or greater:  not more than 15 percent of such 
areas shall be developed and/or re-graded and/or stripped of vegetation with the 
exception that no more than five (5) percent of such areas may be disturbed in the case of 
erosion-prone soils, as defined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
 
2.  When identifying “steep slope” areas of a development (rise/run >  33%) the engineer 
shall use a topographic map or site plan having a contour interval of not less than 2 feet to 
determine changes in elevation (rise).  Unless otherwise approved by the Planning and 
Engineering staff a length (run) of not more than 100 feet shall be used to calculate the 
approximate slope of the area under consideration.   



May 10, 2021 

IV-28 

 
3. When a proposed development will not meet the standards of Section 410.D.1. above, 
a development plan must be submitted for the review of the City Engineer and approval 
of the Planning Commission.  Approval of this development plan shall be based on its 
consistency with the intent of this Ordinance.  

 
   
Section 411.  Reclamation of Undeveloped Land.   
 
In the event that construction of a development has not been completed within one year of date 
of approval of the preliminary plat or development plan; said development shall be reviewed by 
the Planning and Engineering staff to determine if reasonable progress toward completion of the 
development is being made.  Evidence of reasonable progress may include, but shall not be 
limited to, installation of streets, utility lines and stormwater management facilities; laying 
structural foundations; and completion of any stage of a development approved under a staging 
plan pursuant to Section 1002.09.  However, the clearing and grubbing of land, in the absence of 
other improvements, shall not by itself constitute evidence of reasonable progress.  
 
Upon a determination that reasonable progress is not being made, the Planning Commission may 
require the owner of the development site to restore the land to the same condition that existed 
prior to the initiation of the development, and place a time limit on completion of said 
restoration.   
 
If such restoration is not feasible, the City Engineer and the Planning Director shall work with 
the property owner to determine an acceptable condition or degree of reclamation; at the very 
least, the site shall be sodded or planted in grass, and appropriate measures shall be taken to 
prevent or eliminate soil erosion.  In all cases, restoration activities shall be consistent with 
appropriate Best Management Practices as recommended by the Alabama Forestry Commission, 
the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and/or the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS).   
 
 
Section 412.  Areas Subject to Flooding.   
 
The boundaries of special flood hazard areas shall be identified by referencing the most current 
FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), an approved Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or an 
approved Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). 
  
The boundaries of any special flood hazard area shall be clearly denoted on all development 
plans for parcels subject to flooding.  Said boundaries shall be determined using a site specific, 
topographic survey of the parcel and the appropriate FIRM, LOMR, or LOMA. 
 
On those parcels for which no base flood elevation (BFE) has been developed, it shall be the 
responsibility of the owner to have a registered professional engineer or hydrologist to establish a 
BFE. 
 



June 28, 2021 

IV-29 

On-site topographic surveys shall be performed to locate the precise floodplain line on a parcel 
prior to any development.  The survey shall use the flood profile contained in the sources listed 
above or, if no such profile exists, by performing standard runoff calculations such as those 
contained in Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, prepared by 
the Natural Resources Conservation Service.   
 
412.01.  Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.  All provisions of the Flood Damage 
Prevention Ordinance #2028, as amended, shall be applicable to development in the floodplain.  
See Appendix A. 
 
412.02.  Permanent open space.  All such areas shall be permanent open space.  No uses or 
improvements other than those permitted herein shall be permitted in any area consisting of 
floodway as defined by this Ordinance.   
 
412.03.  Permitted uses.  The following uses are permitted within the floodway fringe as a 
matter of right:   
 
            A.  All uses that are permitted in designated open spaces.   
 
            B.  All uses that are classified as agriculture, nurseries, and outdoor recreation.   
 

C.  Piers, bridges and bridge approaches, picnic shelters, and stormwater detention 
facilities, so long as the building permit application shows that a licensed engineer 
has certified that such structures are designed to withstand the forces exerted by the 
100-year flood event at that location.   

 
412.04.  Building Elevation.  All other buildings or any residential, institutional, office, 
commercial and entertainment, commercial recreation, recreational rental dwelling, or nursery 
uses (other than those specifically named in this Section) may be permitted as conditional uses 
pursuant to Section 1003, provided that all habitable floor area shall be raised so that no floor, or 
its structural supports, or any utility line has less than one (1) foot of clearance between its 
lowest point and the 100-year flood elevation.  Any reduction of cross-sectional area due to 
vertical supporting members shall be offset by compensatory storage.  Vehicular access to such 
structures shall be at or higher than the 100 year base flood elevation (BFE).   
 

Exceptions to 412.04 above may be as follows subject to the approval of the City 
Engineer: 

A.  A non-residential building may have its finished floor elevation below the BFE as 
long as it fully complies with FEMA requirements. 

 
B.  A non residential building may have parking or parking access below BFE as long as 

it fully complies with FEMA requirements. 
 
Note:  Evidence of full compliance with FEMA requirements must be provided at time of 

submission.

412.05.  Installation of fill materials.  Fill may be placed within the floodway fringe only when 
allowed as a conditional use pursuant to Section 1003.  An application for such conditional use 
shall be accompanied by detailed fill plans, showing existing and proposed conditions.  If a 
structure is to be placed on the fill, the plans shall show the structure as well.  In considering the 
application, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the proposed fill meets the 
general standards set forth in Section 1003, and the following additional standards:   
 

A.  The cross-sectional area of a riverine floodplain shall not be reduced by more than 
two and one-half (2 ½) percent on either side of the centerline of the watercourse; an 
inland depressional floodplain may have its location and contours altered through cut 
and fill over 30 percent of its surface area.   

 
B.  Compensatory storage shall be provided to offset the storage lost through the filling.   

 
C.  All changes in velocity, depth of flood elevation, or storage shall be limited to the 

property owners who have been granted flood or flow easements, provided that in no 
event shall an increase in flood elevation be permitted if it would affect any existing 
building or bring any building to within one (1) foot of the flood elevation.   

 
D.  In no instance shall the depth of fill in a riverine floodplain exceed five (5) feet, nor 

shall any fill be placed within 50 feet of the top of the stream bank or in a location 
which might be endangered by or accelerate a meander.  In an inland depressional 
floodplain the depth of fill measured from the natural grade to the new surface shall 
not exceed five (5) feet.   

 
E.  Fill shall consist of soil or rock materials only; sanitary landfills shall not be permitted 

in the floodplain.  Further, all fill areas shall be stabilized with material that will 
insure and protect against erosion hazards, undercutting, and undermining. 

 
412.06.  Filling in Floodway.  See Section 1003.   
 
412.07.  Structural anchoring.  Any structure placed in the floodplain shall be anchored firmly 
to prevent floodwaters from carrying it downstream.  Such anchoring shall be sufficient to 
withstand a flood velocity of six (6) feet per second.  The Planning Commission shall require the 
applicant to submit the written opinion of a registered professional engineer that the proposed 
structural design meets this standard. 
 
 
Section 413.  Lakes and Ponds.     
 
All such areas that serve a stormwater or flood retention purpose shall be permanent open space 
maintained by the developer, property owner or other legally bound and authorized agent.  No 
development or diverting of these bodies of water shall be permitted without a development plan 
approved by the City Engineer.  Alteration of lakes and ponds shall be permitted only if surface 
area and flood retention volumes remain unchanged or are enlarged.  
 



May 10, 2021 

IV-31 

Lake Shorelines:  The shorelines of lakes [two (2) acres or greater in size], consisting of 
the area within 100 feet from the shorelines, shall contain no more than 15 percent 
impervious surfaces.  At least 75 percent of all such areas shall be permanent open space.  

 
Pond Shorelines:  The shorelines of ponds [less than two (2) acres in size], consisting of 
the area within 50 feet from the shorelines, shall contain no more than 15 percent 
impervious surfaces.  At least 75 percent of all such areas shall be permanent open space.  

 
 
Section 414.  Drainageways.   
 
Re-grading, stripping of vegetation, or filling in drainageways is permitted only after review and 
written approval by the City Engineer, provided that the resultant drainageway has less velocity 
than existed previously or reduces stream bank erosion through the provision of erosion control 
measures. 
 
 
Section 415.  Open Space.   
 
Land that is required by this Ordinance to remain as open space may be used for the recreation, 
agriculture, resource protection, amenity and other purposes specified in this Section.  Open-
space land shall be freely accessible to all residents of a development, with the exception that 
agricultural land uses shall be permitted to restrict access to that land to those solely engaged in 
agricultural pursuits.  
 
Open space shall have qualities making it useful to residents of the development for either 
passive or active recreation, and will be developed to serve that purpose. Open spaces shall serve 
an important environmental/resource protection or visual role in separating the development 
from existing public ways or from other existing or potential developments; or shall be of value 
in dividing the development into coherent sub-areas.  Non-recreational buildings, except those 
related to agricultural uses permitted under Section 415.01(C) shall not occupy open-space land.  
 
415.01.  All developments required by this Ordinance to provide open space shall meet the 
following requirements.   
 

A.  Land designated as open space shall be maintained as open space and may not be 
separately sold, subdivided, or developed, and no structures shall be built on such 
land, except as provided below.  All such properties shall be owned and maintained 
by the developer, owner of the development site, homeowners association, or other 
private entity approved by the City Attorney. 

  
B.  An open-space plan shall be submitted as a part of the application for a site plan or 

subdivision approval.  This plan shall designate and indicate the boundaries of all 
open-space areas required by this Ordinance.  The plan shall:   

 



May 10, 2021 

IV-32 

1.  designate areas to be reserved as open space.  The specific design of open-space 
areas shall be sensitive to the physical and design characteristics of the site.   

 
2.  designate the type of open space, as established in this Section, to be provided.   
 
3.  specify the manner in which the open space shall be perpetuated, maintained, and 

administered in accordance with Section 415.02.  
 
4.  include proof of a mandatory and functioning Home Owners Association and 

contact information for same.  The Northport Department of Planning & 
Inspections shall be provided an annual update of said contact information  

 
C.  The types of open space that may be provided to satisfy the requirements of this 

Ordinance, together with the maintenance required for each type, are as follows:   
 

1.  natural areas are areas of undisturbed vegetation or areas replanted with 
vegetation after construction.  Woodlands and wetlands are specific types of 
natural areas.  Natural watercourses are to be maintained as free flowing and 
devoid of debris.  Stream channels shall be maintained so as not to alter  the base 
flood elevation.   

 
2.  agricultural uses specified in Section 404.01.   
 
3.  garden plots are the division of open space into plots for cultivation as community 

gardens.  Any change of use for the open space must be with the approval of the 
adjoining land owners and the Home Owners Association. 

 
4.  recreational areas are areas designed for specific, active recreational uses having 

minimal requirements for structures, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, 
softball fields, and golf courses.  An enclosed structure shall be permitted in a 
recreational area only where it directly supports a specific facility and does not 
require off-street parking.  Recreational areas shall be accessible to all residents of 
the development.   

 
5.  greenways are linear green belts linking residential areas with other open-space 

areas.  These greenways are encouraged to designate developed bicycle paths, 
footpaths, bridle paths, fitness trails, or other similar development.  Inter-
connecting the greenway system between residences and recreational areas is 
encouraged.   

 
D.  Open space shall be appropriately located and large enough to address the open space 

characteristics cited throughout Section 415.   
 

1.   No dwelling unit shall be located more than 750 feet from designated open space.  
The Planning Commission may waive this distance requirement where the 
developer proposes a major recreational facility which will occupy at least 50 



May 10, 2021 

IV-33 

percent of the required open space for the development.  No more than ten (10) 
percent of the dwelling units in the development may be occupied before this 
facility is completed and available for use.   

 
Where intervening non-recreational properties separate a dwelling unit from an 
open space area, the Planning Director may require an easement or other means of 
access for non-motorized traffic to avoid the need for pedestrians to cross or 
travel on roads carrying vehicular traffic.   

 
2.  No parcel of property, or portion thereof, less than 40 feet wide and 7,500 square 

feet in size shall be counted toward the designated open space requirement.   Open 
space areas containing paved or stabilized paths for pedestrians and/or bicycles 
shall be exempt from this requirement if such paths are part of a comprehensive 
circulation system serving a portion of the development or are included in 
connecting Greenways.   

 
3.  All open space shall be easily visible and freely accessible.   
 
4.  The following shall not count toward fulfillment of designated open space 

requirements:

k)  any other areas which the Planning Director finds to be inconsistent with the 

intent of this Section.   
 
In addition, no lake, pond, or other permanent water body shall constitute more than 25 percent 
of the total open space required for the development.  No golf course shall constitute more than 
60 percent of the total open space required for the development.   
 
415.02.  Preservation of open space.  Open-space areas shall be maintained so that their use and 
enjoyment as open space is not diminished or destroyed.  Where open space is to be provided 
within a subdivision, such areas shall be designated by creating separate parcels within the 
perimeter of the plat.  These parcels shall be given a sequential lot number, labeled as to their 
intended use, and the plat shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance 
responsibility.   
 
Where open space is provided within a development site, which is the subject of a site plan, and 
is under different ownership than the rest of the site, it shall nevertheless remain part of the 
development site pursuant to Section 1002.11.  Unless the site plan is modified or terminated in 
accordance with Section 1002.08, the open space areas shall be used only as provided in Section 
415.  The site plan shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance 
responsibility.

of the following mechanisms or combinations thereof:   
 

A.  Common ownership of the open space by a homeowner’s association, which assumes 
full responsibility for its maintenance. 

 
B. Deed-restricted private ownership that shall prevent development and/or subsequent 

subdivision of the open-space land and provide the maintenance responsibility.  This 
arrangement shall be noted on the site plan and/or subdivision plat.  Full and proper 
legal documentation shall be submitted to the Planning Director Full and proper 
written legal documentation of said ownership and maintenance responsibilities shall 
be submitted to the Planning Director and be approved by the City Attorney prior to 
commencement of development activities. 

  
 
Section 416.  Transportation Impact Report.   
 
416.01.  Purpose.  The transportation impact report shall identify the traffic impacts of a 
proposed use.  The report shall show improvements required to:  insure safe ingress to and egress 
from a proposed development; maintain adequate street capacity, and eliminate hazardous 
conditions.  The report also will be used to determine whether the proposed development is 
consistent with transportation-related policies of the City of Northport. 
 



May 10, 2021 

IV-35 

416.02.  Applicability.  The City Engineer, particularly in the following cases, may require a 
transportation impact report:   
 

A. Any development that proposes to take direct access to any collector or arterial 
road. 

 
B. Any residential development that proposes the construction of 30 or more 

dwelling units. 
 

C. Any use that will generate in excess of either 100 trips per acre per day or 250 
trips per day.  Trip generation rates for proposed uses shall be determined by 
consulting the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of 
Transportation Engineers, and/or the City Engineer.   

 
416.03.  Contents of transportation impact report.  The transportation impact report shall 
contain, as a minimum, the following data and information:   
 

A. General site description.  A detailed description of the highway network within 
one (1) mile of the site, a description of the proposed land uses, the anticipated 
stages of construction, and the anticipated completion date of the proposed land 
development shall be provided.  This description, which may be in the form of a 
map, shall include the following items:  (a) all major intersections, (b) all 
proposed and existing ingress and egress locations, (c) all existing roadway 
widths and rights-of-way, (d) all existing traffic signals and traffic-control 
devices.   

 
In addition, any changes to the highway network within one-half (1/2) mile of the 
site, proposed by any governmental agency, shall be described.  This description 
shall include the above items, as well as any proposed construction project that 
would alter the width and/or alignment of the present highway.  Such information 
can be obtained from the City Engineer, County Engineer and Office of the 
Division Engineer, Alabama Department of Transportation.   
 

B. Description of existing traffic conditions.  A report based on the following shall 
be provided:  A 24-hour traffic count shall be conducted for a period of five (5) 
weekdays (Monday – Friday) on all roadways that have direct access to a 
proposed development site.  The existing average daily traffic (ADT) volume and 
the highest average peak hour volume for any weekday hour between 3 PM and 6 
PM shall be recorded.  These traffic volumes shall be averaged to determine the 
average hourly peak traffic volume for the five days Monday through Friday.   

 
C. Transportation impact of the development.  The average weekday trip generation 

rates (trip ends) and the highest average hourly weekday trip generation rate 
between 7 AM and 9 AM and between3 PM and 6 PM for the proposed use shall 
be determined from the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute 
of Transportation Engineers, or from figures provided by a qualified traffic 



May 10, 2021 

IV-36 

engineer.  A report shall be made detailing the nature and extent of the trip 
generation expected to result from the proposed development.   

 
D. Analysis of transportation impact.  The projected total future peak hour traffic 

demand shall be calculated for all roads fronting on a proposed site and all major 
intersections within one-half (1/2) mile of the site.  This demand shall consist of 
the anticipated traffic that will be generated by the proposed development, plus an 
assumed normal increase of traffic volume of one (1) percent per year, unless 
traffic-engineering studies indicate a different rate of change.  An analysis shall 
be undertaken to determine if roadways and intersections will operate at the 
appropriate level of service following completion of the development given the 
future peak hour traffic that will be generated by the proposed development.   

 
416.04.  Traffic control devices.  Whenever, as the result of additional traffic generated by a 
proposed development, it is determined that there is a need for a traffic signal, a regulatory sign, 
additional right-of-way or acceleration/deceleration lanes, the developer shall make such planned 
improvements a part of his development plans and shall propose a schedule to the Planning 
Commission for making such improvements  Anticipated improvements required by future 
development, and the developer share in those improvements, are listed in the following 
paragraphs.   
 

A. Traffic signs.  Include the normal stop, yield, caution, and street signs, but also 
may include special signs such as “watch for traffic entering”, “blind hill” and 
“pedestrian crossing”, may also be required.  Such signs will be placed by the 
developer entirely at the developers’ expense.  These signs shall be specified, 
installed, and maintained in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic 
Control Devices.   

 
B. Traffic signals.  Include any and all lighted signals.  Such installations will be 

placed at the direction of the agency having jurisdiction.  This paragraph also 
applies to signalization and improvement of railroad crossings.  Because of the 
timing of the actual installation of signals by authorized agencies, the developer 
will be required to post a bond guaranteeing the estimated cost of improvements 
covered by this paragraph. 

  
 
Section 417.  Clear View of Intersection Streets.   
 
To provide a clear view of intersection streets to the motorist, there shall be a triangular area of 
clear vision formed by the two intersecting streets.  The size of this triangular area is a function 
of traffic volume and speed and is depicted for right-angle intersections in Figure 8.  At oblique 
intersections, in which two roads form an angle of 60 degrees or less, required clear areas shall 
be determined by the City Engineer, based on design criteria set forth in the most recent edition 
of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, prepared by the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).   
 



May 10, 2021 

IV-37 

Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, there are unusual and/or specific 
circumstances relating to a street intersection such that the application of Figure 8 may not be 
appropriate, the intersection shall be referred to the City Engineer who shall recommend a 
triangular area of clear vision using the standards contained in the current edition of the Manual 
of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.   
 
On any portion of a lot that lies within the triangular area defined according to this section, 
nothing shall be erected, planted, placed, or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to 
impede vision between a height of two and one half (2.5) feet and ten (10) feet above the grade at 
the intersection of the street center lines. 
 
  
Section 418. Traffic Management.   
 
418.01. Curb Cuts.   
 
Because frequent curb cuts and driveways providing access to numerous adjoining properties are 
a severe impediment to the proper functioning of major streets, on-site circulation and cross-
access agreements between lots are required, to control the problem when land is subdivided.  
There shall be a minimum spacing of 300 feet for driveways and other curb cuts on arterial 
streets and 300 feet on collector streets.  In areas where single-family detached homes abut 
collector streets, an average distance of 125 feet shall be allowed between curb cuts. 
 
New single-family residential lots shall not be allowed direct access to collector and arterial 
roadways without approval of the City Engineer. 
  
The following table summarizes required distances between curb cuts and street corner property 
lines:   
 

Development Type Street Type 
(all districts except Downtown/Riverfront area) 

 Arterial Collector Local 
Non-Residential 125’   100’ 100’

Development per 
§603.02(e) 

125’ 100’ 100’ 

All Other Residential 125’ 100’ 25’ 
    

 
 
Where an intersection contains a left-turn stacking lane, any driveway opposite such lane shall be 
designed to permit entrance and exit by right turn only.  Such "right turn" entrances shall be 
constructed with raised islands to prevent left-turn movements.  No left turns shall be permitted 
where such turning motions would cross an acceleration or deceleration lane in proximity to an 
intersection. 
 



May 10, 2021 

IV-38 

 Required distances between curb cuts and between curb cuts and street corner property lines 
shall be measured from the edge of the curb cut. 
 
   
418.02. Access For Lots of Record and Redevelopment.  
 
In the interest of public safety, lots of record, as defined by this Ordinance, shall be afforded 
vehicular access at the direction of the City Engineer and in accordance with the MUTCD.  This 
access may take the form of a curb cut, or shared curb cut, directly onto a public right-of-way or 
may be limited to cross-access via an adjoining lot (see Section 420.04).  The City reserves the 
right to adopt access plans for thoroughfares in rapidly redeveloping areas in order to facilitate 
traffic management and public safety.  The Planning Commission and City Council shall approve 
such plans. 
   
418.03. Acceleration/Deceleration Lanes.    
 
Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be provided by the developer at the direction of the City 
Engineer.  Such improvements must be designed and constructed to city, county or state 
standards.  The cost of such improvements will be borne entirely by the developer. 
   
 
418.04. Cross-Access Requirements.   
 
Adjoining lots with frontage upon collector or arterial roads may be required to provide cross-
access and permanent ingress/egress easements to adjacent properties in the interest of 
accommodating the curb-cut requirements, public safety and facilitating vehicular traffic.  Such 
access shall be required at the discretion of the City Engineer. 
   
 
418.05. Median Cuts.    
 
Center medians are designed and constructed both for traffic safety and aesthetic considerations.  
Such public improvements are constructed at great expense to the public and, therefore, any 
alteration of the existing or planned roadway medians shall be allowed solely at the discretion of 
the City Council, and/or ALDOT; and only where such alteration is in the interest of public 
safety.  Where such alterations are allowed, the entire cost shall be borne by the applicant.  The 
improvement of other medians or similar traffic control devices in proximity to the proposed 
development may be required in consideration for any allowed median alteration. 
 
 
418.06. Additional Right-of-way.    
 
Additional right-of-way required by a specific governmental plan for the improvement of a given 
existing or proposed roadway shall, where possible, be divided equally between adjoining 
property owners on both sides of the existing roadway, and shall be dedicated to the City.  Said 
right-of-way may be required at the time of subdivision or site plan review.

ARTICLE V.     LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS  
 
 
Section 500.  Introduction. 
  
This article recognizes the importance of trees and landscaping throughout the city and 
their relationship with the economic, ecological and cultural processes that give 
Northport its tradition and identity. Through preservation, replacement, and maintenance 
of the urban forest, this ordinance will provide a better quality of life for the citizens of 
Northport. 
 
Urban landscaping aids in preventing soil erosion, siltation of streams and reservoirs and 
flood damage. Trees are essential in providing shade and natural cooling, preventing air 
and noise pollution, as well as preserving community character.  
 
 
501.  Purpose.   
 
The purpose of this chapter is to: 

 
• protect the public health, safety and welfare by mitigating incompatibility 

between adjacent uses through the establishment of buffers between non-
compatible land uses;  

 
•  improve the quality of life for Northport citizens through the reduction of noise, 

glare, heat and air pollution;  
 

• preserve, protect and maintain the healthy existing vegetation and encourage, 
where possible, the incorporation of native plant materials and ecosystems into 
landscape design and discourage the proliferation of invasive plant species; 

 
• establish and maintain sustainable amounts of tree canopy on public and private 

lands in the City; 
 

• improve community character by encouraging aesthetically pleasing sustainable 
design practices, while allowing innovative, diverse and cost conscious 
approaches for design, installation and maintenance of landscaping; 

 
• promote the conservation of local waterways and aquifers by encouraging the 

planting of native species, or site specific species;  
 

• provide means for natural aquifer recharge and prevent excess runoff through the 
provision of landscaping and bufferyards;   

 
• facilitate compliance with Local, State and Federal legislation relative to water 

and air quality, including, but not limited to, the Clean Air Act (Title 42, Chapter 



May 10, 2021 

V-2 

85 of the U.S. Code) and the Clean Water Act (Title 33, Chapter 26 of the U.S. 
Code).

detailed landscape plan along with all other required submission materials. 
 
Prior to any development on any property in the City, the developer or person in charge 
or control thereof shall make application to the Department of Planning and have a 
landscape plan approved as part of the overall development approval process.  A 
landscape plan must be submitted, along with the Land Development Plan, and approved 
by the Director of Planning or his/her designee prior to the issuance of any land 
development permits, (i.e. zoning certificate, building permit, etc.) 
 
The Land Development Plan shall be in conformance with Section 1002 of this 
Ordinance and, in accordance with the provision of this ordinance, shall adequately and 
sufficiently address traffic, parking, stormwater, sanitary sewer, erosion, use of BMPs, 
etc.

513.  Compliance. 
 
For any criteria for which this article applies, the architect, landscape architect, engineer, 
surveyor of record, horticulture professional, or landscape contractor must certify, to the 
Planning Director and/or his/her designee, that the landscaping has been installed to meet 
the minimum requirements of this article. The site will be inspected before a final 
certificate of occupancy will be issued. 
 
In the event that inclement weather delays the installation of landscape materials by less 
than thirty (30) days, the developer may make a written request to the Planning Director  
for an extension to the time of completion for the planting schedule in the approved 
landscape plan.. The request must specifically state the reason for the delay as well as an 
estimated date for completion. Failure to complete the installation within 15 days of 
specified date will constitute non-compliance.  
 
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any new development that has not met the 
requirements of this article or an approved landscaping plan.  Additions or renovations to 
existing parking areas shall also receive a certificate of occupancy prior to usage.  When 
circumstances preclude immediate planting, the administrator may release the 
development for a certificate of occupancy after: 
 

A. The owner or developer has completed all curbing, irrigation systems and 
other non-planting components of the landscaping plan; and 

 
B. Posted a completion bond or certified check in an amount equal to one 

hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the total cost, including labor, of the 
remaining landscaping installation. 

 
Required surety shall be made payable to the City of Northport and submitted to the 
Planning Director or City Engineer.  The Director or Engineer shall set the time limit for 
completion and approval of any guaranteed landscaping, but in no case shall the time 
period exceed six (6) months after the date the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
 
 
514.  Alternative Compliance. 
 

A.  Intent.  The Landscape Requirements are intended to encourage development 
practices which are conscious of the character of the City and its ecological processes.   
Conditions associated with individual sites may under certain circumstances warrant 
approval of alternative methods of compliance. Conditions may arise where normal 
compliance is impractical or impossible, or where maximum achievement of the Purpose 
and Intent of this Article can only be obtained through alternative compliance. It is not 
the intent of this section to allow alternative compliance on the basis of economic 
hardship. In the event that such conditions are present, the Planning Director and/or 
his/her designee shall have authority to adjust the requirements of this article as provided 
below in accordance with the following: 



May 10, 2021 

V-20 

(1)  Request for Alternative Compliance Review.  Requests for alternative 
compliance must be made in writing at the time of application and may be 
granted for any permit application to which the Landscape Requirements 
apply, when one or more of the following conditions are met: 

 
(a)  Improved environmental quality would result from alternative 
compliance. 
 
(b)  Topography, soil, vegetation, drainage or other site conditions are 
such that full compliance is impractical. 
 
(c)  Spatial Limitations, unusual shaped pieces of land, or unusual 
servitude requirements may justify alternative compliance. 
 
(d)  Public safety considerations make alternative compliance appropriate. 
 
(e)  Public Improvement (i.e. streets, water, sewer, etc.) projects make 
alternative compliance appropriate. 
 
(f)  The site is part of a development for which a master plan has been 
submitted which makes adequate provision for landscaping. 

 
The above conditions must be substantiated as part of the written request for Alternative 
Compliance. 
 

(2) Methods of Alternative Compliance. 
 

(a) Reduction in the amount, or variation in types, of required landscaping 
 
(b) Reduction of buffer widths. 

 
(c) Modification of required structures (i.e. fences, walls, berms, etc.) 

 
(d) Modification in configuration or amount of required parking to 

accommodate landscaped islands 
 
In all instances, at the discretion of the Planning Director, such requests for alternative 
compliance may be referred to the Planning Commission for review and approval. 
 
 
515.  Landscaping Requirements for Downtown & Riverfront Areas. 
 
Within the area encompassed by the Northport, Alabama Downtown & Riverfront Plan, 
all peripheral and internal landscaping shall meet those requirements setout in the 
Northport Core City Zoning and Design Standards. (See Article VIII)  Additionally, 
unless otherwise specified in said plan, streetscapes shall be developed along Main

Avenue and 1st Street to mimic those already present along Main Avenue in these 
districts. 
 
 
 516.  Ownership & Maintenance. 
 
The owner of property developed in accordance with an approved landscape plan shall be 
responsible for maintaining all landscaping in good condition.  The maintenance required 
under this section shall include the prompt replacement of all dead or damaged 
landscaping materials, whether from natural or unnatural causes, so as to insure continued 
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
 
All landscape and bufferyard materials shall be maintained by the owner of such 
materials so that the purpose and effect of the landscaping and bufferyards is not 
diminished.  The following minimum maintenance activities are required:    
 

A.  Replacement of plant materials destroyed by any cause.   
 

In the case of any canopy tree removed or otherwise destroyed by the willful 
act of the property owner, tenant or contractor, a tree of the same or larger 
caliper must be used as a replacement.  Where replacement at the same or 
larger caliper is not feasible, the Planning Director may provide alternative 
replacement criteria. 
 

B.  Repair and/or replacement of fences and walls that deteriorate or are damaged 
by any cause.   

 
C. Restoration of berms that are altered by erosion, construction, or other causes.   

 
D.  Irrigation of landscape materials is strongly recommended, particularly for 

larger development sites.  Landscaping lost due to lack of rainfall or irrigation 
shall be required to be replaced by the property owner. 

 
Bufferyards constitute an integral part of a development site, and may not be subdivided, 
sold, dedicated, or otherwise conveyed separately from the development site of which 
they are a part.  The City shall not approve any development plan in which a required 
bufferyard or any portion of a required bufferyard lies on land, which is not part of the 
development site. 
 
 
517.  Legal aspects, other Regulations. 
 
All local, state and federal laws and regulations shall be considered when interpreting 
provisions of, or technical specifications published pursuant to, this article.  In each 
instance, the more restrictive requirement shall govern unless sound engineering 
judgment can determine and prove that the more restrictive requirement would be 



May 10, 2021 

V-22 

otherwise unnecessary,  In most instances, laws and regulations that are phrased more 
explicitly shall apply over those items that are not phrased as precisely. 
 
Nothing herein contained shall authorize a person to engage in development or earth 
changes in a manner inconsistent with current zoning or subdivision regulations or other 
applicable codes or ordinances.  All development or earth changing activity shall be in 
conformity with current zoning or subdivision regulations and all other applicable codes 
or ordinances. 
 
A landscape plan does not authorize any person or developer to engage in any activity 
that would violate any other applicable code, ordinance, regulation or state or federal 
laws nor substitute for obtaining any licenses or permits otherwise required. 
  
 
518.  Penalty for Violation. 
 
Failure to comply with the requirements of this Article shall be deemed a violation of the

ARTICLE VI.   DETAILED USE REGULATIONS 
 
 
Section 600.  Purpose.   
 
The purpose of this Article is to specify the detailed regulations, including bulk, layout, setbacks 
and lot area, which apply to specific land uses.  Standards over and above those imposed by 
other sections of this Ordinance are necessary for certain land uses which, although permitted as 
of right in certain districts, have characteristics that might have negative impacts on nearby uses 
without these additional regulations.   This Article also specifies the regulations applicable to 
temporary and accessory uses, and it details the off-street parking and loading requirements of 
permitted land uses. 
 
  
Section 601.  Standards Applicable to Certain Uses.   
 
In addition to compliance with other regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the following 
standards are required of the specific uses enumerated below. 
 
601.01.  Renovation, Adaptive Reuse, and Preservation of Structures.   
 
Because there may be value to the community in the renovation, reuse and preservation of 
structures, and because these actions serve the public interest, renovation, reuse, and preservation 
of structures are encouraged in all zoning districts.   
 

A. In addition to a site plan required pursuant to Section 1002, each proposed renovation, 
reuse or preservation of an existing structure shall include a floor plan showing the 
internal use of the structure.   

 
B.  It is anticipated that the renovation, reuse, and preservation of existing structures will 
involve difficulties with maximum densities in some zoning districts, bufferyard 
requirements and off-street parking.  Where these conditions occur, the Planning Director 
may impose such standards as fencing, screening, and planting as he/she deems 
appropriate to buffer existing adjacent properties.  The Planning Director shall, in the 
case of higher densities and off-street parking, make such recommendations to the 
Planning Commission as he/she deems reasonable in supporting the concepts of 
renovation, reuse, and preservation of structures in the City of Northport.   

 
601.02.  Exceptions to Minimum Yard Requirements.  The following structures shall be 
allowed to project into or be constructed in any minimum required yard as follows:  
 

• awnings and canopies, roof overhangs and balconies not to exceed three (3) feet;  
• bay windows, not to exceed two (2) feet;  
• clotheslines; driveways and their curbs, fences, walls, and hedges may be constructed in 

minimum yard areas, provided that their installation does not violate any other provision 
of this Ordinance.   



March 21, 2018 

VI-2 

• Uncovered decks of no more than 30 inches in height may extend to within five (5) feet 
of the property line.   

 
Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to allow encroachment of any feature into a 
required bufferyard.   
 
601.03.  Voluntary Dedication of Property for a Public Purpose.  No existing lot shall be 
reduced in area or dimension below the minimum requirements applicable to such lot under the 
provisions of this Ordinance, except that when a lot is reduced in dimension or total area by 20 
percent or less by the voluntary dedication by the owner and acceptance of a portion of such lot 
by the City for a public use, the lot shall be considered to contain the dimensions and area it 
contained prior to such dedication.  However, for purposes of measuring compliance with 
setback requirements of this Code, the dimensions and area of such lot as it exists after the 
voluntary dedication shall apply.   
 
601.04.  Limitations on Animals.  – See Chapter 14 of the City of Northport, Alabama Code 
of Ordinances. 
 
601.05.  Moving of Buildings.  No structure shall be moved from one development site to 
another unless such structure shall, at the new location, comply with all applicable provisions of 
this Ordinance.   
 
 
602.  Broadcast/TV/Radio and Telecommunication Tower Use Regulations.   
 
Except where otherwise stated herein, the following standards shall apply to all types of 
broadcast and communication towers within the City of Northport. 
 

A.  General Regulations and Requirements.  All requirements for site plan approval, as 
set out in Article X, shall be met at the time of application for site of new  towers.   

 
B.  Safety/Structural Design of Towers.  All broadcast towers must comply with 
requirements as set out in the latest edition of the EIA-222 code “Structural Standards for 
Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures,” as amended, published by the 
Electronic Industries Association and all other applicable structural safety standards, 
building and technical codes having jurisdiction, so as not to endanger the health and 
safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower 
due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God.   

 
C.  Security.  A chain link fence shall be installed around the perimeter of the compound, 
with a minimum height of eight (8) feet as measured to the top of the fence (or barbed 
wire, if applicable).  Such fence is to be located on the perimeter of the compound unless 
otherwise approved as part of the site plan submitted with the application of site plan 
approval.  Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound.  Climbing 
pegs shall be removed from the lower 20 feet of all broadcast towers.   

 



March 21, 2018 

VI-3 

D.  Lighting Restrictions.  There shall be no lighting on any tower except when required 
by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC).  In cases where the FAA or FCC does require a tower to be lighted, any such 
lighting shall be the minimum necessary to comply with federal regulations.  Written 
documentation of any FAA or FCC directives to light a tower differently than provided 
herein must be submitted with the site plan application.   

 
Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity, shall not be directed or 
reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than 
ten (10) feet.   

 
E.  Maintenance.  The owner of a broadcast tower shall be responsible for maintaining 
the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening, buffers, security and other 
installations required by this Section, and by any other applicable codes, ordinances, 
regulations, statutes or conditions of approval imposed by the City of Northport or its 
authorized representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site.   

 
F.  Landscaping. Broadcast towers constructed in conjunction with a principal structure 
(i.e. radio/TV station) shall comply with all bufferyard and landscape requirements as set 
out in Article V.   

 
G.  Abandoned Facilities.  Any broadcast facility that ceases to be used for its original 
communications purpose shall be removed at the owner’s expense.  The owner of the 
facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the FCC of the 
intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing to 
remove the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural 
condition.   

 
In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required 
from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required 
to remove its facilities within the one hundred and twenty (120) day period prescribed 
above.  At such time as all providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their 
facilities located thereon, the owner of the tower shall complete the removal and 
restoration process as set forth herein.   

 
H.  Area and Dimensional Requirements.  The following area and dimensional 
regulations shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section:   

 
             1.  Minimum Lot Area:  Determined by setback requirement.   
 

2.  Minimum Setbacks:  Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a 
distance equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger 
parcel, setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site). 
Maintenance/equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as 
specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed.   

 



March 21, 2018 

VI-4 

3.  All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the 
proposed tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence. Guy 
anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound.   

 
4.  Bufferyard Requirements:  See Article V 

 
I.  Height and Location Restrictions.  In regard to the height and sitting of all broadcast 
facilities and their associated structures the following regulations shall be observed:   

 
1.  No broadcast tower site boundary shall be located closer than 200 feet to any 
residence.   

 
2.  No tower shall be located less than a distance equal to its height, as measured 
from the base of the tower, from any Residential (RS) District zoning boundary.  
Any new towers so located shall further be restricted to a monopole or self-
supporting design.   

 
3.  No tower shall exceed a height of 300 feet.   

 
4.  Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it 
shall be sited behind the front plane of said structure.  Property located in the 
Agricultural District (AG) shall be exempt from this provision. 

 
   
602.01.  Telecommunications Towers.   
 
In addition to the standards set out in Section 602 above; the following standards shall apply 
specifically to telecommunication towers. 
 

A.  Application and Justification.  All requirements for site plan approval, as set out in 
Article X, “Development Approval Process”, shall be met at the time of application for 
siting of new telecommunications towers.  In addition to meeting the general 
requirements for site plan approval, the following information shall be provided when 
applying for approval of a communication tower:   

 
1.  A current U.S.G.S. quadrangle map (1:24,000), or equivalent, showing the 
proposed site location and at least a two (2)-mile radius around the site;   
 
2.  A scaled elevation diagram of the facility, showing the type, height, finish, 
lighting, site improvements and other such details as necessary to convey an 
image of the facility at the proposed location;   
 
3.  A study prepared by a radio frequency specialist that includes a mapped 
coverage analysis of the proposed facility and its relationship to the next nearest 
adjacent cell(s) and an inventory and evaluation of existing towers, alternative 
sites and available structural facilities (e.g. buildings, billboards, water towers, or 



March 21, 2018 

VI-5 

other structures that could be used for support in lieu of a new tower) considered 
within a two (2)-mile radius of the proposed location.   
 
4.  An inventory of all the provider’s existing telecommunications towers and 
communications antenna sites in Tuscaloosa County (including those located in 
municipalities within Tuscaloosa County).  This inventory must include:  

 
a)  The location, parcel identification number, and ownership of the 
telecommunications tower. 
 
b)  Name of co-locators. 
 
c)  Height of tower. 
 
d)  Type of tower or nature of other structure where antenna is located. 
 
e)  Name of Wireless Communication Service Provider co-location 
coordinator. 
 
f)  Copy of Wireless Communication Service Provider’s FCC license.   

 
In the event such inventory has already been provided, each successive 
application must include an update such that said inventory will be completely 
current and accurate.   

 
5.  Written documentation justifying the need for a new telecommunications 
tower site to be located on the proposed site.  This documentation must address, at 
a minimum, how the proposed tower is justified in relation to the following 
points:   
 

a)  a list, description and map of the potential co-location, nonresidential 
use or alternative location sites that are located within the geographic 
service area of the proposed site;   
 
b)  documentation that requests for co-location have been made at least 30 
days prior to the filing of application for site plan approval 
 
c)  a detailed explanation of why each such site was not technologically, 
legally or economically feasible, or why such efforts were otherwise 
unsuccessful;   
 
d)  an analysis of how and why the proposed site is essential to meet 
service demands for the geographic service area and the countywide 
network;   

 



March 21, 2018 

VI-6 

6.  Certification that the proposed telecommunications tower is structurally and 
technically designed and capable, and will be so constructed, to meet the co-
location requirements set forth in this Section.  Immediately upon completion of 
construction, as-built certifications of same shall be submitted as well. 

 
B.  Co-location Requirements.  All towers constructed subsequent to the adoption of this 
Section, and their associated compounds, shall be designed and built to accommodate 
additional wireless communication service providers based on the height of the tower as 
follows:   

 
1.  Towers 80 to 159 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of two (2) 
providers. 
 
2.  Towers 160 to 209 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of three (3) 
providers. 
 
3.  Towers of 210 to 300 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of four (4) 
providers.   

 
Carriers wishing to co-locate on an existing tower may receive administrative approval of 
their request. 

 
C.  Maximum Utilization of Existing Sites.  No new telecommunications tower shall be 
constructed if space is structurally, technically, and economically available for the 
proposed telecommunications antenna(s) and related facilities on an existing tower; or on 
an alternative site (e.g. building or other structure), where such alternative location would 
cover the required service area without creating undue signal interference.   

 
D.  Pre-Existing Towers.  Any telecommunications tower or telecommunications antenna 
for which a permit has been properly issued shall hereafter be considered a non-
conforming use subject to the provisions of Article IX of this Ordinance.  The purpose 
and intent of this Section is to minimize the proliferation of new towers and promote the 
co-location of new antennas onto existing towers.  Any communications antenna locating 
on a pre-existing properly permitted telecommunications tower subsequent to adoption of 
this Section shall be exempt from the restrictions of Article V of this Ordinance when the 
provisions below are met:   

 
1.  If structural strengthening is necessary to accommodate co-location, the tower 
type shall remain the same as previously permitted.   
 
2.  There will be no increase in the total height or type of lighting of the facility, 
including the tower, antennas and all other associated facilities.   
 
3.  All setback and buffer requirements applicable to the existing tower, at the 
time its permit was issued will continue to be applicable to such tower.   

 



March 21, 2018 

VI-7 

The Planning Department shall permit such facilities through administrative review and 
approval. 

   
602.02. Exemptions.  The following wireless communications facilities shall be exempt from 
the requirements of this Section:   
 

1.  Amateur radio antennas and receive-only antennas not more than 60 feet in 
height, and satellite earth station antennas two (2) meters or less in diameter, shall 
be exempt as provided for in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 when 
no supportive tower is to be constructed.   
 
2.  Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by public 
emergency agencies or government agencies.   
 
3.  Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by private 
entities, or for internal communications by public utilities, provided such facilities 
do not exceed a total of 60 feet in height whether mounted to a structure or ground 
mounted.   

 
The Planning Director shall make determination of exemption of any such facilities exceeding 
the foregoing dimensions. 
 
   
603.  Residential Use Regulations.   
 
This Section specifies the minimum lot dimensions and other requirements for each type of 
residential unit permitted by this Ordinance, except in areas designated as Special District (SD).   
 
When a lot size exceeds the minimum permitted area, all other standards applicable to the 
minimum lot area shall nevertheless apply.  The figures specified in the tables of this Section are 
expressed in terms of square feet, feet, or a ratio, whichever applies. 
 
 Lot sizes and other requirements for residential lots within Special Districts (SD) shall be 
established through the review and approval of the required Master Development Plan,  (See 
Section 604).   
 
603.01.  Conventional subdivisions.  A conventional subdivision consists of single-family 
dwellings on individual lots and, unless otherwise required by Article V, requires no public or 
community open space, including resource protection and recreation land.   
 
A conventional subdivision is characterized by division of the entire subject parcel into lots.  
Table 6-1, Lot Area, Setbacks and Maximum Impervious Surface and Parking Requirements for 
Conventional Subdivisions, specifies the minimum standards for conventional single-family 
subdivision lots of various sizes in zones other than “RS”.  Table 6-2 provides development 
standards for conventional subdivisions in the Residential (RS) District.

property within the perimeter of the subdivision plat, regardless of whether or not such facilities 
will ultimately be dedicated to the City.  Such developments shall contain the minimum amount 
of open space specified in the Master Development Plan.  Prior to approving the final plat, the 
Planning Director shall verify that all parcels or tracts not intended for use as residential lots are 
clearly delineated on the plat as to size and dimension.  The purpose, ownership, and 
responsibility for maintenance for each parcel or tract shall be noted on the plat.   
 
Unless specifically accepted by the City Council, the City of Northport shall not be responsible 
for maintenance and/or repair of any common facility or properties.   
 
Performance residential developments shall be self-contained in terms of meeting the 
requirements of this Ordinance.  In addition to other relevant requirements, site plans and 
subdivision plats shall designate and establish maintenance responsibility for all required 
recreation, resource protection, and other open space and common properties within the 
development site.  Where a performance residential development is to be built, a Master 
Development Plan shall be required.  In such cases the Planning Director may determine if 
Special District Zoning is appropriate.

(5) feet from the property line.  (See Figure 13) 

 
For each unit constructed along a side lot line, an easement of five (5) feet in width shall 
be created on the adjoining property.  The purpose of this easement is to permit 
maintenance and repair of the portion of the structure bordering the zero side yard.  All 
maintenance easements shall be shown on the final plat, along with an indication of the 
lot to which each easement is assigned.  No fence, patio, deck, or structure of any kind 
shall be placed within a maintenance easement.   

 
Zero lot-line units shall not take access from an arterial road.

603.04.  Infill/Existing Neighborhoods.  The intent of this section is to ensure neighborhood 
compatibility, maintain harmony and character of existing residential areas, and ensure 
residential infill development occurs in a desirable manner. 
 
For subdivisions developed and lots platted prior to the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance 
(Ordinance 1779; April 2, 2012), every attempt should be made to comply with the current 
zoning standards.  The Planning Director and/or Zoning Administrator may determine that 
compliance with current zoning setbacks are unreasonable or would create a house out of 
character with the neighborhood.  The following options are permitted to be used: 
 

1. Setbacks found in the zoning ordinance in effect immediately prior to Ord. 1779 
2. Setbacks found on the recorded plat or master plan 
3. For front setbacks: an average of the front setbacks for the lots with houses adjacent to 

and on the same side of the street of the proposed house 
 
If the above options are unable to be used or would create a layout out of character with the 
neighborhood, as determined by the Planning Director and/or Zoning Administrator, then a 
variance must be sought through the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 
 
Section 604.  Master Development Plan.   
 
Where any development site is to be developed in stages or phases, no plat or phase plan for any 
fraction of the site shall be accepted for review, unless a Master Development Plan is submitted.  
A Master Development Plan shall be required in connection with any request for Performance 
Residential Development or  Special District (SD) zoning.  A Master Development Plan shall 
also be required for any development containing a mixture of residential and non-residential land 
uses, and/or more than one of the dwelling unit types described in Section 603.02. 
  
The Master Development Plan shall be a conceptual plan showing the entire development site 
and all component stages or phases, and shall express the overall development concept for the 
site at build-out.  The plan shall show all proposed streets and shall demonstrate compatibility 
between adjacent land uses.  The plan has two additional purposes:  to ensure that required 
amenities keep a reasonable pace with residential construction in a phased development; and to 
establish an outer perimeter for the purpose of calculating density and required open space. 
 
The Master Development Plan shall include the following information: 
 

A.  outer boundary or perimeter of the overall development site, including a valid legal 
description; 

 
B.  approximate locations of all proposed streets; 

 
C.  type, number and approximate locations of all dwelling units; 

 



March 21, 2018 

VI-23 

D.  overall gross density for the development site, as well as density for each individual 
stage or phase; 

 
E.  location and approximate acreage of all resource protection, recreation, and open 
space lands and other common properties; 

 
F.  location of all streets and drainage facilities; 

 
G.  required bufferyards; and 

 
H.  any other information which the Planning Director determines to be relevant.   

 
Where a Master Development Plan is submitted in conjunction with a Special District (SD) 
zoning this plan shall include a written statement addressing design standards within the 
development, including minimum residential lot sizes and widths, building setbacks, building 
heights, signage, impervious surface and floor area ratios, and any other information the 
Planning Director determines to be relevant.  Upon approval, this written statement shall become 
a component of the Master Development Plan and shall be binding upon all future development 
on the site.   
 
When a Master Development Plan is required, such plan shall be reviewed and approved by the 
Planning Commission prior to or simultaneously with any regular site plan or subdivision plat 
submitted.  Upon approval of the Master Development Plan, the developer may submit and the 
Planning Commission may approve subdivision plats or site plans for individual phases or 
stages. 
 
The Master Development Plan shall include a schedule showing density and open space on a 
cumulative basis upon completion of each phase.  All stage or phase plans shall be consistent 
with the approved Master Development Plan. 
 
 Once approved, the Master Development Plan shall become a binding condition of development 
on the site, and subsequent stages or phases of the development shall be substantially consistent 
with it.  If the Planning Director finds that any stage or phase plan substantially deviates from the 
approved Master Development Plan, a revised master plan shall be required for Planning 
Commission review prior to approval of further site plans or subdivision plats within the 
development. 
 
 Any of the following changes shall constitute a “substantial deviation:”   
 

A.  An increase or reduction in land area of the development. 
 

B.  An increase in the total number of dwelling units. 
 

C.  Provision of less than the required percentage of recreation, resource protection, or 
open space land. 

 



March 21, 2018 

VI-24 

D.  Proposal of single family attached, duplex, multi-family or zero lot-line development 
in place of approved single family detached housing. 

 
E.  Any significant addition, removal or rearrangement of land uses and streets.   

 
Master Development Plan approval shall expire 24 months after granted unless significant 
progress has been made toward implementation of the development.  Such progress shall be

Section 605.  SPECIAL DISTRICT  (SD) 
 
Special districts are hereby authorized for the purpose of providing optional methods of land 
development, which encourages imaginative solutions to environmental design problems. Areas 
so established shall be characterized by a unified building and site development program 
providing for coordinated open space and architectural treatment. The special districts authorized 
by this Article are also intended to provide means for the establishment of uses, which are 
generally considered to be incompatible with most other land usage.  
 
605.01.  Procedure.   The procedure to be followed in the creation of special districts shall 
conform to the regulations for any other zone change with the following exceptions.  
 

A.   Any petition for the establishment of a Special District shall be submitted to the 
Planning Commission for its review and action. Approval of the request shall be based on 
the Commission's consideration of the following:  

 
1)  That the proposed development is consistent with the intent and purpose of 
this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and welfare.  

 
2)  That the final plan for the proposed development meets the requirements of 
this ordinance as well as the requirements of all other regulating bodies.  

 
3)  That an approved method of sewage disposal is available to the tract under 
consideration.  

 
B.  The establishment of a Special District will be for the express purpose of improving 
the tract of land in accordance with the approved plan of development for the particular 
tract of land and for the uses set forth in the development plan.  

 
C.  If, within two (2) years from the effective date of the zone amendment, construction 
has not commenced, the Planning Commission may, by appropriate action, repeal the 
amendment establishing the Special District. Once construction is started the 
improvements set forth in the plan of development must be completed within two years 
from date of issuance. Otherwise, the Planning Commission may repeal the amendment 
establishing the Special District. Extension of time may be granted as long as satisfactory 
progress is being made.

such tract of land be zoned as a Planned Shopping Center District by proceeding under 
the provisions of this article, but the failure of such owner or owners to apply under this 
article shall not prevent them from constructing or causing to be constructed a retail sales 
complex, customarily called a Shopping Center, upon such tract of land provided the 
same is zoned so as to permit its use for this purpose.

floor area or 20 percent of the total spaces required can be permitted.  The site plan shall 
indicate the location and dimensions of the parking area provided, and shall include 
calculations showing the number of parking spaces eliminated pursuant to this Section 
which otherwise would have been required.

B.  Sufficient area must be reserved to provide for the total number of off-street parking 
spaces required by Section 610.  The purpose of this reservation is to insure adequate area 
to meet any future need for additional parking spaces.  Prior to site plan approval, the 
applicant shall sign a written statement agreeing to provide additional spaces up to the 
full amount required by Section 610 upon notification by the Planning Director and/or the 
Planning Commission that such spaces are needed.  This statement shall be provided to 
the Planning Department and City Attorney in letter form and shall be reproduced on the 
site plan.   

 
C.  The reserved parking area shall be shown on the site plan and shall be grassed, 
landscaped or otherwise covered in vegetation.  It shall not include signs or other 
structures, drainage or percolation fields for sewage disposal, areas exceeding 12 percent 
slope, required bufferyards, areas of general or off-street parking landscaping required 
under Article V, setbacks, or areas which would otherwise be unsuitable for parking 
spaces due to the physical characteristics of the land or other requirements of this 
Ordinance.  

 
 
 611.  Lighting.   
 
All lighting must be directed and/or shielded so as to focus lighting onto the use as established 
and away from adjacent property and areas of pedestrian and vehicular traffic including, but not 
limited to, sidewalks and streets.  
 
All lighting fixtures incorporated into non-enclosed structures (i.e. gas pump canopies, car 
washes, etc.) must be fully recessed into the underside of such structures. 
 
Light or glare from any operation and all lighting for parking areas or for the external 
illumination of buildings or grounds shall be directed or located in such a manner as to focus 
lighting onto the use and away from adjacent property and areas of pedestrian and vehicular 
traffic including, but not limited to, sidewalks and streets.  (See Figure 17) 
 
A lighting plan must be provided with all development plans (i.e. site plans and subdivision 
plats) showing, at a minimum, placement of all lighting structures, height of structures, and 
illumination levels taking into account landscaping and other possible obstructions. 
 
 
Section 612.  Flag Lots.   
 
A flag lot is a lot that has minimal frontage on a publicly owned and maintained street, whose 
width some distance back from the street boundary line meets all Ordinance requirements.  (See 
Figure 5)  The purpose of flag lots is to reduce the number of direct access points to arterial and 
collector roads.  Flag lots may be permitted, even though they do not meet the minimum lot 
width requirements at the street boundary line, subject to the following conditions:   
 



March 21, 2018 

VI-51 

A.  Flag lots shall be limited to single family residential use only.  No more than one (1) 
dwelling unit shall be authorized for any one (1) flag lot access strip.   

 
B.  A flag lot may be used within a subdivision to provide a lot fronting on an arterial or 
collector road with access to an internal subdivision street.  In such cases, vehicular 
access to the lot from the arterial or collector shall be prohibited.  In any event, no more 
than 10 percent of the lots in any subdivision may be approved as flag lots.   

 
C.  Flag lots providing access to arterial or collector roads shall be prohibited.   

 
D.  Flag lot “stems” or access strips shall be at least 25 feet in width as measured at the 
road frontage.  The land area within the access strip shall not count toward the required 
minimum lot size. 

 
E.  Where otherwise consistent with the provisions of this section, flag lots may be 
created in groups not exceeding two (2); in such cases, access strips shall be adjacent to 
each other and form a total width of 50 feet.  A distance of 500 feet shall separate non-
adjacent flag lot access strips on the same side of the road.  All access strips shall be at 
least 25 feet from an intersection.  

 
G. The Planning Director shall identify the front, side and rear lot lines of a flag lot for 

determining yard requirements, allowable locations of accessory structures, and other 
purposes.  

 
Section 613. Fences and walls. 
  
 In non-residential zones, no wall or fence shall exceed a height of ten (10) feet.  In 
residential zones, no wall or fence shall exceed eight (8) feet.  No fence or wall may project into 
the unobstructed space required at a street intersection, as determined by the City Engineer.  In a 
front yard, walls and fences shall be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, and 
colors of the principal building.  Solid wood fences are permitted in rear and side yards only.  No 
part of a fence in a required front yard shall be within ten (10) feet of the curb line, nor shall it be 
on the public right-of-way.  In residential zones, no fence in a required front yard shall exceed 
four feet in height.  For the purposes of the section, the front yard shall be defined as the yard on 
the side of the front entrance of the residence. (See Figure 20.) 
 
All fences and walls must be permitted.  Maintenance and repairs that do not change the original 
dimensions, or replace or alter less than 50% of the fencing materials do not need a permit. 
 
If the property abuts a public street, the finished side of the fence shall face the street.

ARTICLE VII.  CORE CITY ZONING & DESIGN STANDARDS 
 

 
700.  Background 
In 2008, the City of Northport embarked upon a planning process for the city’s downtown, 
riverfront, and surrounding historic neighborhoods.  Based upon extensive public input, this 
plan was enthusiastically supported by the community.  It is the intent of this zoning and design 
standards document to help implement that plan for this area, which is now referred to as the 
“Core City” for planning purposes.  Only by codifying the key ideas of the plan can it be 
insured that its future implementation is consistent with the community’s collective vision for 
the area. 

 
 

701.  Districts & Sub-Districts 
 
The City’s 2008 Downtown and Riverfront Plan established a total of fourteen (14) sub-districts 
for planning purposes.  Each sub-district reflected the plan’s intended primary land uses, 
physical form, and development character.   
 
In preparing the zoning and design standards, two key issue categories emerged for each sub-
district: 1) site design standards and 2) zoning and architectural design standards.  Site design 
standards address issues such as access, parking, loading areas, lighting and landscaping.  
Zoning and architectural design standards address issues such as permitted land uses, building 
heights, setbacks and architectural design.  While each sub-district had relatively distinct zoning 
and architectural design standards, it was determined that many of the sub-districts could 
effectively use the same site design standards.  Consequently, each sub-district has been 
grouped with a district category, and each sub-district within that district category shares the 
same site design standards.  The sub-districts are listed below and delineated on the map on the 
following page. 
 
 
Urban Mixed Use Districts    Urban Residential Districts 
South Main Riverfront District    Historic Neighborhood District 
Historic Downtown Core District    New Urban Neighborhood District 
Residential/Commercial/Institutional District  Multi-Family Housing District 
Bridge Avenue South District 
Neighborhood Centers District    Employment Districts 
        Light Industrial District  
Suburban Mixed Use District    Working Riverfront District 
Bridge Avenue North District  
        Ecological Districts 
Institutional District     River’s Edge District 
Institutional District     Conservation District

702. Street Types 

 
Whether walking, cycling, driving or through some other means of transit, most people 
experience the built environment as viewed from streets.  They are not only important for 
transportation, but their design is critical to the function and character of the places they 
traverse.  Consequently, this zoning and design standard document for the Core City 
starts with a review of street types.  A total of eleven (11) street types and two (2) alley 
types have been designated.  The variables between each type include the number of 
driving lanes, the number of parking lanes, parking lane angles, sidewalks, street trees, 
and the dimensions of all of these elements.  The street types are delineated on the map 
below.   
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
  



April 2, 2012 

VII-4 

The following pages provide illustrations of the various street type cross sections. 
 

With regard to sidewalks, the materials and design will depend upon the specific location.  
Brick (or similar looking pavers) and concrete should be the two primary materials.  
Depending upon the location, some sidewalks might be all brick, some all concrete, and 
some a combination.  For example, the blocks on Main Avenue near the river should be 
all brick to match the existing streetscape near Main and Fifth.  On the other hand, 
concrete can be scored and colored to add visual interest and may be more appropriate in 
other areas.  Regardless of the potential options, within any single block face, the design 
and materials should be consistent to avoid a random mixture lacking visual 
cohesiveness.  Within the Urban Mixed Use, Urban Residential, and Ecological Districts, 
utilities should be buried underground.

703. URBAN MIXED USE DISTRICTS 
 
  
703.01. Site Design Standards: Urban Mixed Use Districts 
 
These site design standards shall apply to the following five urban mixed use districts 
within Northport’s core city area:  South Main Riverfront District, Historic Downtown 
Core District, Residential/Commercial/Institutional District, Bridge Avenue South 
District, and Neighborhood Centers District.  
 
A.  Access & Parking 
 

 1.  Vehicular Access.  Access to parking areas shall be limited to rear alleys where 
possible to avoid the proliferation of driveways along streets.  When driveways accessed 
from streets are deemed necessary, they shall be accessed from secondary streets rather 
than primary streets, when possible.  The “primary street” is the street designed for and/or 
experiencing the higher level of traffic relative to the “secondary street.”  Driveways shall 
be located along the edge of the lot.  When opportunities occur, shared access driveways 
should be provided along property boundaries.  Multiple adjacent driveways shall be 
avoided.  No more than one (1) driveway shall be allowed per property unless the parking 
lot’s size and traffic projections warrant a second driveway.   
 

2.  Cross-Access.  Direct vehicular access between adjoining properties shall be 
provided where possible as an alternative to indirect access via the associated street.  
Such access shall be located within the rear half of the lot, and may exist in the form of 
an alley or an internal driveway connecting the parking areas.    
 

3.  Driveway Widths.  Driveway widths shall not exceed twelve (12) feet for single-
lane driveways or twenty-four (24) feet for two-lane driveways.  No driveways may have 
more than two (2) lanes at their point of intersection with the street.   
 

4.  Drive-Through Windows/Facilities.  Drive-through windows/facilities are 
permitted only if: 1) they are not visible from a public street, and 2) they adhere to the 
other vehicular access and driveway width standards of this code. 
 

5.  Parking Amounts.  See Section 611 of the zoning ordinance for parking standards 
which are based upon specific land uses and building areas.  Within urban mixed use 
districts, seventy-five (75) percent of the amount of parking otherwise required by City 
codes is required.  No more than one hundred and twenty-five (125) percent of the 
amount of parking otherwise required by City codes shall be allowed within mixed use 
districts.  Parking requirements may be waived, either wholly or partially, for properties 
within six hundred (600) feet of a public parking facility.  Designated on-street parking 
located directly adjacent to a property, excluding parking on the other side of the street, 
shall be credited toward meeting the property’s on-site parking requirements.  
Requirements for minimum amounts of parking are completely waived within the 
Historic Downtown Core District and the Residential / Commercial / Institutional 
District.   



April 2, 2012 

VII-13 

6.  Parking Location.  Parking lots shall not be located between a building and a 
street or between a building and the riverfront unless they are located in such a manner 
(below grade, etc.) so as to not be visible from the street or the riverfront.  Parking lots 
shall not front onto primary streets, which consist of Main Avenue, First Street, Fifth 
Street, and Bridge Avenue (south of Rice Mine Road).  In the case of a corner lot on 
Main and Fifth, the parking shall front onto Fifth rather than Main.  Where parking lots 
front onto secondary streets, they shall be sufficiently screened per the parking design 
standards below.  These parking location requirements may be waived for properties 
fronting Rice Mine Road.    
 

7.  Parking Design.  Peripheral Screening: A year-round screening treatment shall be 
provided between any parking area and adjacent street.  The screening area shall be a 
minimum of five (5) feet in width.  While it should visually obscure pavement and 
vehicles and provide shade, for security purposes, it should not completely preclude 
views into the parking lot.  Screening should include shade trees with an average 
maximum spacing of twenty (20) feet.  Screening shall also include a low fence or wall, 
and/or shrubs with a minimum height of three (3) feet at the time of planting.  Fencing 
shall be wood or metal, but shall not include chain link.  Walls shall be brick, stone or 
concrete clad in stucco.  Shrubs shall be evergreens.  Trees shall be a minimum caliper of 
2.5 inches at the time of planting. 
 
Internal Landscaping:  Landscaped islands or projections shall be provided to include one 
(1) or more shade trees at the end of all parking rows and within long parking rows.  For 
each parking row, there shall be no more than ten (10) consecutive parking spaces 
between landscape islands/projections.  Trees shall be a minimum caliper of 2.5 inches at 
the time of planting.

VII-14 

8. Parking Structures.  See the section addressing building design for the relevant 
district for parking structure standards. 
 
B.  Loading & Refuse 
 

1.  Location.  Loading areas and refuse storage areas shall be located behind 
buildings and not readily visible from a street.  

 
2.  Screening.  To the extent that site conditions and street configurations require, 

fencing and/or landscaping shall be used to screen loading areas from streets.  Refuse 
storage areas shall be completely screened from views both external and internal to the 
site with the provision of a wall or solid fence, and they shall include a screening gate for 
access to the refuse containers.  Walls or fencing used for screening shall be visually 
compatible with the materials and design of the corresponding building, and it shall be 
taller than the height of the refuse containers, but no taller than ten (10) feet. 
 
C.  Lighting 
 
Freestanding lights shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height for all urban mixed use 
areas, including streets, parking and pedestrian areas.  Fixtures shall be hooded or 
shielded to minimize light trespass, reduce glare and minimize visibility from adjacent 
properties.  Fixtures shall not direct light onto adjacent properties. 
 
D.  Street & Streetscape Design 
 
The design of streets and their streetscapes, including driving lanes, on-street parking 
sidewalks, landscaping and other features, shall be governed by the street classification 
map and corresponding cross-section designs (See Pages VII-3 through VII-11). 
 
E.  Service Stations 
 
Automobile service stations are conditional uses within specified urban mixed use 
districts.  In addition to other conditions that might be applied, they must meet the 
following standards: 
 

1.  Pump Locations.  Fuel pumps shall not be located between the associate building 
and the primary street.  They shall be located behind the building and not readily visible 
from the primary street, although they may be visible from secondary streets in the case 
of corner lots. 

 
2.  Building Design.  The service station building shall be designed to appear as a 

conventional retail building. 
 
3.  Canopies & Lighting.  The ceiling of canopies above fuel pumps should be a 

maximum of fourteen (14) feet in height.  Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be 
recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the ceiling of the canopy or 



April 2, 2012 

VII-15 

shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy so that light is restrained to no more that 
85 degrees from vertical. 
 
 
703.02. South Main Riverfront District. 
 
It is the intent of this district to provide a mixed-use area that is urban in form, pedestrian 
friendly; human scaled and provides visual and physical access to the river. 
 
A.  Land Uses 
 

1.  Permitted Principal Uses:  Retail, restaurants, entertainment, artist studios, 
offices, personal services, professional services, lodging, multi-family or attached 
housing, daycare/pre-school, institutional/civic uses (not exceeding a 5,000 sq. ft. 
building footprint), and parking garages if:  a) located behind a building, or b) fronted 
with round floor retail and/or services on the Main Avenue and First Street frontage.  
Multi-family and attached housing buildings shall feature at least four (4) units per 
building.   

 
2.   Permitted Accessory Uses:  Accessory uses are permitted when meeting each of 

the following standards: 
 

A. Accessory use is customarily accessory, clearly incidental and subordinate 
to permitted principal uses; 

B. Accessory use is wholly located on the same lot as the permitted principal 
use or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership; and 

C. The use does not involve operations not in keeping with the character of 
the area. 

 
3.  Permitted Conditional Uses:  Permitting the following conditional uses is a 

discretionary decision of the City and may be approved with any reasonable conditions 
related to the use’s location, design and operation.  Permitted conditional uses are limited 
to the following:  passenger terminals and utility substations. 
 

4.  Prohibited Uses:  Ground floor street-fronting housing is prohibited on Main 
Avenue.  Auto-oriented uses, such as service stations, car washes, and automobile 
dealerships, are prohibited. 
 
B.  Building Scale & Placement 
 

1.  Maximum Building Height:  Sixty (60) feet.  Building heights shall be measured 
from the average grade of the front façade to either:  a) the top of the parapet on the front 
façade of flat-roofed building; or b) the top of the eave on the front façade of pitched-
roofed buildings.  Non-habitable vertical architectural elements, such as steeples and 
cupola, shall not be counted toward building height calculations. 

 



April 2, 2012 

VII-16 

2.  Commercial Ground Floor Height:  The minimum ground floor height of 
buildings in which the first floor will be used for commercial purposes shall be fourteen 
(14) feet.  The ground floor height shall be measured from the finished floor to the 
ceiling. 

 
3.  Railroad Trestle Visibility:  Between Main Avenue and the railroad within this 

district, no building shall be higher than seventy-five (75) percent of the height of the 
railroad tracks, as measured from the average elevation along the property line adjacent 
to the railroad right-of-way. 

 
4. Front Setback: 

Minimum:  Zero (0)  feet from public right-of-way line 
Maximum:  Ten (10) feet from public right-of-way line 

 
Exceptions from the front setback standards are permitted for the following cases: 

• Buildings featuring ground floor residential front onto a street other than Main 
Avenue as long as parking lots are not within the setback.  Such exceptions shall 
feature a front courtyard design in which at least one third of the building’s 
frontage adheres to the zero (0) to ten (10) foot setback requirement, and the 
courtyard depth shall not exceed fifty (50) feet as measured from the public right-
of-way line. 

• Institutional/civic buildings fronting onto an open space (lawn, courtyard, park, 
plaza, etc.) so long as the setback does not exceed seventy-five (75) feet as 
measured from the public right-of-way line. 

• Outdoor dining if a low wall is used to define the street wall and the setback does 
not exceed fifty (50) feet as measured from the public right-of-way line.  Such 
wall shall be architecturally compatible with its associated building.  The wall 
shall be between two (2) and three (3) feet in height, and iron fencing may be 
incorporated so long as it does not exceed a combined height of four (4) feet. 

 
5.  Side Setback:  There are no side setback requirements 
 
6.  Rear Setback:  Minimum five (5) feet 
 
7.  Building Frontage:  At least seventy-five (75) percent of a lot’s street frontage 

shall be occupied by a building adhering to the front setback requirements.  In the case of 
corner lots, such street frontage shall be defined by the building’s primary façade and 
primary street. 

 



April 2, 2012 

VII-17 

 
 

 
C.  Building Design 

 
1. Roofs. 
 
Form:  Roofs shall be flat, gabled or hipped.  Flat roofs shall feature a parapet wall 

sufficient to visually screen roof penetrations (other than chimneys) as viewed from any 
public street.  Building components not constituting the primary structure, such as 
porches and dormers, may feature a shed or hipped roof. 

 
Penetrations and Equipment:  Pipe vents, air conditioning units, and similar roof top 

penetrations and equipment (not including chimneys) shall be located and/or screened in 
a manner that minimizes their visibility.  Chimneys shall be made of a masonry material. 
 

2.  Minimum Foundation Heights.  These standards apply only to buildings 
featuring ground floor residential space fronting onto a street.  Buildings shall have a 
foundation height (measured from finished grade to finished first floor) of at least twenty-
four (24) inches. 

 
3.  Façade Design. 
 
Massing:  No front façade plane shall exceed a width of thirty (30) feet without an 

interruption.  Facades shall be broken into a series of vertical bays using any of the 
following elements:  wall off-sets of at least four (4) inches in depth, material changes, 
pilasters (engaged pillars), columns/posts (including as part of a porch and/or balcony), 
roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches, and front steps and/or stoops.  
Depending upon the design of the building, more than one (1) such element may be 
required to achieve the appropriate massing.  When used as the sole means, material 



April 2, 2012 

VII-18 

changes, roofline or cornice line changes, and front steps and/or stoops alone will not 
suffice. 

 
Glazing:  A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the front façade’s ground floor shall be 

glazed (comprised of glass in the form of doors and/or windows).  The floor shall be 
considered the area between finished floor level and the same floor’s ceiling.  The 
maximum sill height for ground floor windows shall be three (3) feet and the minimum 
head height shall be eight (8) feet.  A minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the front 
façade’s upper floors shall be glazed.  Glass anywhere on the front façade may not be 
reflective or heavily tinted.   

 
Door & Window Design:  The building’s primary entrance shall face the associated 

street.  All windows, with the exception of storefront windows, shall have a vertical 
orientation.  However, individual vertically oriented windows may be “ganged” to 
collectively have a horizontal orientation.  Doors and windows with muntins shall feature 
real muntins or simulated divided lites on both sides of the glass, rather than “snap-in” 
and similar limitations.  Shutters, if provided, shall be sized to fit the window and appear 
to be operable. 

 
Awnings, Canopies & Balconies:  Awnings, canopies and balconies are encouraged, 

but not mandatory.  If provided, awnings shall be canvas.  Canopies shall be wood or a 
composite material and either:  a) perpendicular to the façade and flat, or b) feature a 
shed roof or a hipped shed roof with standing seam metal and a slope no greater than 
4:12.  V-crimp roofing imitating standing seam metal is permitted.  Balconies shall be 
wood and/or metal and have a minimum depth of six (6) feet.  If roofed, balcony roofs 
shall follow the standards for canopies.

VII-19 

D.  Façade Cladding Materials 
 
“Primary façade cladding materials are those which, individually or collectively, 
constitute at least seventy-five (75) percent of the exposed surface area.  Primary material 
changes shall not occur at outside corners.  Primary material changes shall occur on a 
horizontal line with the heavier material below the lighter material (for example; siding 
above masonry). 
 

1.  Permitted Primary Materials:  Wood, brick, stone, cast stone, plaster/smooth-
finished stucco, and materials identical in appearance including, but not limited to, Thin 
Brick, Thin Stone, Exterior Insulation Finishing System* (EIFS), etc. 
 
Wood Cladding shall be limited to lap siding and other forms of horizontal boarding, 
board-and-batten and other forms of vertical boarding, and wood shingles.  Horizontal 
boarding shall have a maximum exposure of eight (8) inches. 
 
*Exterior Insulation Finishing System (EIFS) shall be limited to no more than sixty (60) 
percent of exposed surface area on buildings over forty (40) feet in height; on buildings 
forty feet and under EIFS is limited to twenty (20) percent for trim and cornice work.  
Only a water management EIFS system shall be installed, where permitted. 

 
2.  Permitted Secondary Materials:  The following materials shall not exceed, 

individually or collectively, twenty-five (25) percent of the exposed surface area:  
concrete (not including smooth-finished concrete block) and metal. 

 
3.  Prohibited Materials:  The following materials are completely prohibited from 

comprising the exposed surface area:  vinyl, stucco, smooth-finished concrete block, non-
drainable EIFS and other materials not specifically permitted. 
 
E.  Parking Structures 
 
Parking structures fronting onto any street shall be designed to have the general 
appearance of a building along its street frontage with respect to materials and façade 
massing.  The building design standards for this district should be considered in the 
parking structure’s design.  Sloping interior floors of parking structures should not be 
visible and shall not be expressed on facades facing a street.  Along Main Avenue and 
First Street, a parking structure shall be set behind other buildings (“liner buildings”) so 
as not to be visible from the right-of-way except at the point of vehicular access.  Liner 
buildings shall be built in accordance with the standards in this district.  Along other 
streets, cars parked at street level shall be screened from view.  Where opportunities 
exist, access points shall occur off alleys or secondary streets rather than the primary 
street.  Vehicular access from a primary street shall be limited to a single ingress land and 
a single egress lane.  Pedestrian access shall be clearly visible and vertical circulation 
should be expressed architecturally on the exterior of the building, especially at corners.

or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership; and 
C. The use does not involve operations not in keeping with the character of the 

area. 
 

3.  Permitted Conditional Uses:  There are no permitted conditional uses within this 
district. 
 

4.  Prohibited Uses:  Ground floor street-fronting housing is prohibited on Main 
Avenue.  Auto-oriented uses, such as service stations, car washes, and automobile 
dealerships, are prohibited. 
 
B.  Building Scale & Placement 
 

1.  Maximum Building Height:  Forty (40) feet.  Building heights shall be measured 
from the average grade of the front façade to either:  a) the top of the parapet on the front 
façade of flat-roofed buildings; or b) the top of the eave on the front façade of pitched-
roofed buildings.  Non-habitable vertical architectural elements, such as steeples and 
cupola, shall not be counted toward building height calculations. 

 
2.  Commercial Ground Floor Height:  The minimum ground floor height of 

buildings in which the first floor will be used for commercial purposes shall be fourteen

C.  Building Design 
 

1. Roofs. 
 
Form:  Roofs shall be flat, gabled or hipped.  Flat roofs shall feature a parapet wall 

sufficient to visually screen roof penetrations (other than chimneys) as viewed from any 
public street.  Building components not constituting the primary structure, such as 
porches and dormers, may feature a shed or hipped roof. 

 
Penetrations and Equipment:  Pipe vents, air conditioning units, and similar roof top 

penetrations and equipment (not including chimneys) shall be located and/or screened in 
a manner that minimizes their visibility.  Chimneys shall be made of a masonry material. 
 

2.  Minimum Foundation Heights.  These standards apply only to buildings 
featuring ground floor residential space fronting onto a street.  Buildings shall have a 
foundation height (measured from finished grade to finished first floor) of at least twenty-
four (24) inches. 

 
3.  Façade Design. 
 
Massing:  No front façade plane shall exceed a width of twenty-five (25) feet without 

an interruption.  Facades shall be broken into a series of vertical bays using any of the 
following elements:  wall off-sets of at least four (4) inches in depth, material changes, 
pilasters (engaged pillars), columns/posts (including as part of a porch and/or balcony), 
roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches, and front steps and/or stoops.  
Depending upon the design of the building, more than one (1) such element may be 
required to achieve the appropriate massing.  When used as the sole means, material 
changes, roofline or cornice line changes, and front steps and/or stoops alone will not 
suffice. 

 
Glazing:  A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the front façade’s ground floor shall be 

glazed (comprised of glass in the form of doors and/or windows).  The floor shall be 
considered the area between finished floor level and the same floor’s ceiling.  The 
maximum sill height for ground floor windows shall be three (3) feet and the minimum 
head height shall be eight (8) feet.  A minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the front 
façade’s upper floors shall be glazed.  Glass anywhere on the front façade may not be 
reflective or heavily tinted.   

 
Door & Window Design:  The building’s primary entrance shall face the associated 

street.  All windows, with the exception of storefront windows, shall have a vertical 
orientation.  However, individual vertically oriented windows may be “ganged” to 
collectively have a horizontal orientation.  Doors and windows with muntins shall feature 
real muntins or simulated divided lites on both sides of the glass, rather than “snap-in” 
and similar limitations.  Shutters, if provided, shall be sized to fit the window and appear 
to be operable.

C.  Building Design 

 
1.  Roofs. 
 
Form:  Buildings shall have flat, gabled or hipped roofs as their primary roofing.  

Institutional/civic buildings may have non-habitable vertical architectural components, 
such as steeples, featuring less conventional roof forms.  Flat roofs shall feature a parapet 
wall sufficient to visually screen roof penetrations (other than chimneys) as viewed from 
any public street.  Building components not constituting the primary structure, such as 
porches and dormers, may feature a shed or hipped roof. 

 



April 2, 2012 

VII-37 

Penetrations and Equipment:  Pipe vents, air conditioning units, and similar roof top 
penetrations and equipment (not including chimneys) shall be located and/or screened in 
a manner that minimizes their visibility.  Chimneys shall be made of a masonry material. 
 

 
2.  Façade Design. 
 
Massing:  No front façade plane shall exceed a width of thirty (30) feet without an 

interruption.  Facades shall be broken into a series of vertical bays using any of the 
following elements:  wall off-sets of at least four (4) inches in depth, material changes, 
pilasters (engaged pillars), columns/posts (including as part of a porch and/or balcony), 
roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches, and front steps and/or stoops.  
Depending upon the design of the building, more than one (1) such element may be 
required to achieve the appropriate massing.  When used as the sole means, material 
changes, roofline or cornice line changes, and front steps and/or stoops alone will not 
suffice. 

 
Glazing:  Glass anywhere on the front façade may not be reflective or heavily tinted.  
Door & Window Design:  The building’s primary entrance shall face the associated 

street.  All windows shall have a vertical orientation.  However, individual vertically 
oriented windows may be “ganged” to collectively have a horizontal orientation.  Doors 
and windows with muntins shall feature real muntins or simulated divided lites on both 
sides of the glass, rather than “snap-in” and similar limitations.  Shutters, if provided, 
shall be sized to fit the window and appear to be operable. 

 
D.  Façade Cladding Materials 
 
“Primary façade cladding materials are those which, individually or collectively, 
constitute at least seventy-five (75) percent of the exposed surface area.  Primary material 
changes shall not occur at outside corners.  Primary material changes shall occur on a 
horizontal line with the heavier material below the lighter material (for example; siding 
above masonry). 
 

1.  Permitted Primary Materials:   
NC-Commercial District -- Wood, brick, stone and materials identical in appearance 

if not panelized.  Wood Cladding shall be limited to clapboard and other forms of 
horizontal boarding, board-and-batten and other forms of vertical boarding, and wood 
shingles.  Horizontal boarding shall have a maximum exposure of eight (8) inches. 

 
NC-Institutional District --  Wood, brick, stone, cast stone, plaster/smooth-finished 

stucco, and materials identical in appearance including, but not limited to, Thin Brick, 
Thin Stone, Exterior Insulation Finishing System* (EIFS), etc. 
 
Wood Cladding shall be limited to lap siding and other forms of horizontal boarding, 
board-and-batten and other forms of vertical boarding, and wood shingles.  Horizontal 
boarding shall have a maximum exposure of eight (8) inches. 



April 2, 2012 

VII-38 

 
*Exterior Insulation Finishing System (EIFS) shall be limited to no more than sixty (60) 
percent of exposed surface area on buildings over forty (40) feet in height; on buildings 
forty feet and under EIFS is limited to twenty (20) percent for trim and cornice work.  
Only a water management EIFS system shall be installed, where permitted. 

 
2.  Permitted Secondary Materials:  For both NC districts, the following materials, 

when used as a secondary material shall not exceed, individually or collectively, twenty-
five (25) percent of the exposed surface area:  wood, brick, concrete (not including 
smooth-finished concrete block), metal, stone, cast stone, plaster/smooth-finished stucco, 
and materials identical in appearance if not panelized.  Wood cladding shall be limited to 
lap siding and other forms of horizontal boarding, board-and-batten and other forms of 
vertical boarding, and wood shingles.  Horizontal boarding shall have a maximum 
exposure of eight (8) inches. 

 
3.  Prohibited Materials:  The following materials are completely prohibited from 

comprising the exposed surface area:  vinyl, stucco, smooth-finished concrete block, non-
drainable EIFS and other materials not specifically permitted. 
 
 
E.  Parking Structures

704.  SUBURBAN MIXED USE DISTRICT 
 
  
704.01. Site Design Standards: Urban Mixed Use Districts 
 
These site design standards shall apply to the sole suburban mixed use district within 
Northport’s Core City Area:  Bridge Avenue North District. 
  
A.  Access & Parking 
 

 1.  Vehicular Access.  Where possible, access to parking areas shall be encouraged 
off of rear alleys to avoid the proliferation of driveways along streets.  Where driveways 
are accessed from streets, they shall be accessed from secondary streets rather than 
primary streets, when possible.  The “primary street” is the street designed for and/or 
experiencing the higher level of traffic relative to the “secondary street.”  Driveways shall 
be located along the edge of the lot.  When opportunities occur, shared access driveways 
should be provided along property boundaries.  Multiple adjacent driveways shall be 
avoided.  No more than one (1) driveway shall be allowed per property unless the parking 
lot’s size and traffic projections warrant a second driveway. 

 
2.  Cross-Access.  Direct vehicular access between adjoining properties shall be 

provided as an alternative to indirect access via the associated street.  
 

3.  Driveway Widths.  Driveway widths shall not exceed twelve (12) feet for single-
lane driveways, twenty-four (24) feet for two-lane driveways, and thirty-six feet for 
three-lane driveways.  No driveways may have more than three (3) lanes at their point of 
intersection with the street.  
 

4.  Drive-Through Windows/Facilities.  Drive-through windows/facilities are 
permitted only if they are located on the side or rear of the building and not fronting the 
primary street. 
 

5.  Parking Amounts.  See Section 611 of the zoning ordinance for parking standards 
which are based upon specific land uses and building areas.  No more than one hundred 
and twenty-five (125) percent of the amount of parking otherwise required by City codes 
shall be allowed within suburban mixed use districts. 

 
6.  Parking Location.  Parking lots are allowed anywhere on the site relative to street 

and building locations. 
 
7. Parking Design.   
 

Peripheral Screening: A year-round screening treatment shall be provided 
between any parking area and adjacent street.  The screening area shall be a minimum 
of five (5) feet in width.  While it should visually obscure pavement and vehicles and 
provide shade, for security purposes, it should not completely preclude views into the 
parking lot.  Screening should include shade trees with an average maximum spacing 



April 2, 2012 

VII-40 

of twenty (20) feet.  Screening shall also include shrubs with a minimum height of 
three (3) feet at the time of planting.  If fencing is provided within the front yard, it 
shall be wood or metal, but shall not include chain link.  Walls, if provided, shall be 
brick, stone or concrete clad in stucco.  Shrubs shall be evergreens.  Trees shall be a 
minimum caliper of 2.5 inches at the time of planting. 

 
Internal Landscaping:  Landscaped islands or projections shall be provided to 

include one (1) or more shade trees at the end of all parking rows and within long 
parking rows.  For each parking row, there shall be no more than ten (10) consecutive 
parking spaces between landscape islands/projections.  Trees shall be a minimum 
caliper of 2.5 inches at the time of planting.

B.  Loading & Refuse 
 

1.  Location.  Loading areas and refuse storage areas shall be located behind 
buildings and not readily visible from a street.  

 
2.  Screening.  To the extent that site conditions and street configurations require, 

fencing and/or landscaping shall be used to screen loading areas from streets.  Refuse 
storage areas shall be completely screened from views both external and internal to the 
site with the provision of a wall or solid fence, and they shall include a screening gate for 
access to the refuse containers.  Walls or fencing used for screening shall be visually 
compatible with the materials and design of the corresponding building and it shall be 
taller than the height of the refuse containers, but no taller than ten (10) feet. 
 
C.  Lighting 
 
Freestanding lights shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height for all suburban mixed use 
areas, including streets, parking and pedestrian areas.  Fixtures shall be hooded or 
shielded to minimize light trespass, reduce glare and minimize visibility from adjacent 
properties.  Fixtures shall not direct light onto adjacent properties. 
 
D.  Service Stations 
 
Automobile service stations must meet the following standards: 

 
1.  Building Design.  The service station building shall b designed to appear as a

Massing:  No front façade plane shall exceed a width of thirty (30) feet without an 
interruption.  Facades shall be broken into a series of vertical bays using and of the 
following elements:  wall off-sets of at least four (4) inches in depth.  Material changes, 
pilasters (engaged pillars), columns/posts (including as part of a porch and/or balcony), 
roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches, and front steps and/or stoops.  
Depending upon the design of the building, more than one (1) such element may be 
required to achieve the appropriate massing.  When used as the sole means, material 
changes, roofline or cornice line changes, and front steps and/or stoops alone will not 
suffice. 

 
Door & Window Design:  The building’s primary entrance shall face the 

associated street.  All windows shall have a vertical orientation.  However, individual 
vertically oriented windows may be “ganged” to collectively have a horizontal 
orientation.  Doors and windows with muntins shall feature real muntins or simulated 
divided lites on both side of the glass, rather than “snap-in” and similar imitations.  
Shutters, if provided, shall be sized to fit the window and appear to be operable. 

 
Porches:  All single-family detached buildings and duplexes shall have a front 

porch.  The porch shall extend across at least fifty (50) percent of the front façade, and it 
shall have a minimum depth of six (6) feet.  All attached buildings with three (3) or more 
units and multi-family buildings shall have either:  a) a front porch consistent with the 
standards for single-family detached and duplex buildings, or b) a stoop for each street-
fronting ground floor entrance with a minimum depth of four (4) feet.  All porch posts, 
columns, handrails and balustrades shall be wood or composite material.  If roofed, porch 
roofs shall feature a shed roof or a hipped shed roof with a roofing material that matches 
the building or standing seam metal, and a slope no greater than 4:12.  V-crimp roofing 
imitating standing seam metal is permitted.  Porches and stoops may encroach into the 
required front yard, but not into the public right-of-way.

core city area:  Light Industrial District and Working Riverfront District. 
 
A.  Access & Parking 
 

 1.  Vehicular Access.  No more than one (1) driveway shall be allowed per property 
unless: 1) the parking lot’s size and peak-hour traffic projections warrant a second 
driveway, or 2) employee access and truck access must be separate.  
 

2.  Driveway Widths.   
 
Driveways Not Intended for Truck Access:  Driveway widths shall not exceed twelve 

(12) feet for single-lane driveways or twenty-four (24) feet for two-lane driveways, or

lanes at their point of intersection with the street. 

 
Driveways Intended for Truck Access:  Driveway widths shall not exceed twenty-four 

(24) feet in total, regardless of the number of driving lanes.  
 

2. Parking Design.   
 
Peripheral Screening: A year-round screening treatment shall be provided between 

any parking area and adjacent street.  The screening area shall be a minimum of five (5) 
feet in width.  While it should visually obscure pavement and vehicles and provide shade, 
for security purposes, it should not completely preclude views into the parking lot.  
Screening should include shade trees with an average maximum spacing of thirty (30) 
feet.  Screening shall also include a low fence or wall, and/or shrubs with a minimum 
height of two (2) feet at the time of planting.  Fencing shall be wood or metal, but shall 
not include chain link.  Walls shall be brick, stone or concrete clad in stucco.  Shrubs 
shall be evergreens.  Trees shall be a minimum caliper of 2.5 inches at the time of 
planting. 

 
Riverfront Screening:  Any parking areas visible from the river shall be required to 

provide the same peripheral screening as described above along the parking area’s river 
side, with the following exception:  walls and fencing shall not be part of the screening 
materials, and the landscape screening shall create a complete and year-round screening. 

 
Parking Screening Exceptions:  Screening requirements for parking areas may be 

waived where peripheral buffering along the property’s rear or side lot lines is required 
(see below). 
 



April 2, 2012

1) where the abutting property is non-industrial (current use or zoning), including 
residential, commercial, mixed use and institutional, or 2) where the property is visible 
from the river along its rear or side lot lines.  The minimum buffer width shall be twenty 
(20) feet and the buffering treatment shall feature a staggered double row of evergreen 
trees so as to create a year-round complete visual screen.  No buildings or similar 
improvements may occur within the required buffer area, except that river-dependent 
uses may have breaks in the buffering to provide river access to the extent that the 
number and width of such breaks are the absolute minimum necessary for their 
operations. 

 
C.  Loading & Refuse 
 

1.  Location.  Loading areas and refuse storage areas shall be located behind 
buildings and not readily visible from a street or the river. 

  
2.  Screening.  To the extent that site conditions and street configurations require, 

fencing, walls and/or landscaping shall be used to screen loading and refuse storage areas 
from streets and the river on a year-round basis.  Refuse storage areas shall be completely 
screened from views with the provision of a wall or solid fence, and they shall include a 
screening gate for access to the refuse containers.  Walls or fencing used for screening 
shall be visually compatible with the materials and design of the corresponding building 
and it shall be taller than the height of the refuse containers, but no taller than ten (10) 
feet. 

 
D.  Outdoor Storage

braces or other structural members which support it.   
 
Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a 
roadway, the display area shall be the area of one sign face.  Where a sign has two (2) or more 
faces that can be viewed from a single location, the display area of all such faces shall be 
included in determining the total display area of the sign.   
 
Open Letter sign display area shall be measured by the number of square feet in the smallest 
rectangle, within which all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed, 
multiplied by a factor of 0.8.   
 
When a sign is in the form of a three-dimensional object, the area shall be determined by 
drawing a square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the 
projected image of the sign and multiplying that area by two (2).  The “projected image” is that 
image created by tracing the largest possible two-dimensional outline of the sign.

Section 900. Purpose. 
 
It is the purpose of this Article to provide for the regulation of nonconforming structures,  
lots of record and uses, and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which such 
nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. It is necessary and consistent with the 
regulations prescribed by this Ordinance that those nonconformities that adversely affect 
orderly development and the value of nearby property not be permitted to continue without 
restriction.  
 
Nonconformities are existing uses, lots, buildings and structures that were previously lawful, but 
that would be prohibited or subject to more stringent regulation under the zoning districts and 
related requirements established by this Ordinance or subsequent amendments.  

 
A. Legally established buildings, structures and uses in existence at the time of adoption of 

this Ordinance shall be permitted to continue subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 
B. Uses that were illegally established prior to the adoption of this Ordinance shall remain 

illegal and be subject to penalties and remedies that are pursued. 
 
It is the intent of this Ordinance that legal nonconformities, as described in “A” above, be 
allowed to continue, in accordance with the requirements of this Article, but not be enlarged or 
used as the grounds for additional nonconformities.  This Article provides for the regulation of 
legally nonconforming lots, uses, buildings and structures; specifies the conditions under which a 
legal nonconformity can be continued, expanded or modified; and the circumstances under 
which a legal nonconformity shall be terminated

Ordinance.  

Nonconforming Use.  An activity using land, buildings, and/or structures for purposes which

minimum street frontage. 

 

Section 902. Authority to Continue.

lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance, or subsequent amendment thereto, 
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.  

902.02. No nonconformity shall be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended unless such 
alteration is in full compliance with all requirements of this Ordinance, except as noted in 
this Section. Normal maintenance and incidental repair of nonconformity shall be permitted, 
provided that this does not violate any other section of the Article.  

A. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration 
to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who 
is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be 
unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition; provided that such restoration is 
not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this Section prohibiting the 
repair or restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures.  

B. An extension, for the exclusive purpose of providing required off-street parking or 
loading spaces, involving no structural alteration or enlargement of such structure, 
shall not be deemed an expansion of nonconformity, subject to the restrictions of this 
Article. 

C. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to prohibit routine maintenance, 
restoration of a structure to a safe condition, and/or internal renovations, provided the 
total value of such activities does not exceed 50% of the appraised value of the 
structure as determined by the Tuscaloosa County Tax Assessor. 

902.03. No nonconformity shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever,

accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal 
use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all 
regulations of this Ordinance.  

902.05. The burden of establishing the nonconforming status of any structure or land use 
under the terms of this Article, in all cases, shall be upon the owner of such nonconformity 
and not upon the City of Northport.

ownership at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, or any subsequent amendment, and one or 
more of the lots is a nonconforming lot of record, then the land involved shall be considered an 
undivided tract of land.  No portion of the tract of land shall be divided, sold or developed in a 
manner that diminishes the ability of all lots to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance 
or any subsequent amendment.

ARTICLE X.       DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS 
   
 
Section 1000.  Purpose.   
 
This Article sets forth the procedures required for obtaining development approval within the 
City of Northport.  Site plans, subdivisions, conditional uses, zoning certificates, and certificates 
of occupancy are addressed herein.  However, the approval of a development under the 
provisions of this Article does not imply any variation or waiver of any provisions of the 
building code, housing code, fire code, or any other applicable code, standard, or regulation 
adopted by the City of Northport, the State of Alabama, or the United States Government. 
 
   
Section 1001.  Subdivisions.   
 
Any subdivision or resubdivision of land, or combining of lots within the City of Northport, and 
within unincorporated areas lying within five (5) miles of the Northport city limits, shall be 
carried out in accordance with the Northport Subdivision Regulations which are hereby 
incorporated by reference into this Ordinance.  All development within subdivisions shall be 
consistent with applicable sections of this Ordinance. 
 
   
Section 1002.  Site Plans.   
 
This Section shall apply to all site plans as defined in Article II.  The site plan procedures shall 
be required in order to ensure that site-specific development projects meet the requirements of 
this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate authorizing a building permit.  It is the 
intent of this Section that the site plan and design review process be a part of the building permit 
application process, and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the 
site will be constructed and inspected prior to occupancy of the development.   
 
1002.01.  Development Requiring Site Plan Approval.  Prior to issuance of a zoning 
certificate, site plan approval and design review shall be required for all proposed non-residential 
construction and residential development types described in Sections 603.03 (E) and (F).  This 
shall include clubhouses or other ancillary facilities within a residential subdivision.  Site plan 
approval shall also be required for the subdivision of an existing development site of a type 
subject to site plan requirements, and/or an expansion, reduction or reconfiguration of any such 
development type.  For any proposal in which these requirements are unclear, the Planning 
Director shall determine whether site plan approval is necessary.  (See Section 1002.09 C for 
Conditional Uses) 

 
1002.02.  Review of Site Plans.  Site plans submitted for review shall be approved, disapproved, 
or referred to the Planning Commission.  The staff shall establish regular site plan review 
meetings at least two (2) times each month at which both pre-design conferences and formal 
reviews will take place.  When a site plan is disapproved, the reason(s) for the disapproval shall 



May 10, 2021 

X-2 

be provided in writing to the applicant within ten (10) days of the hearing at which the decision 
to disapprove was made.   

 
In approving a site plan, any request for waivers from the requirements of this Ordinance shall be 
taken to the Planning Commission for consideration as provided in Section 1002.04.  Variance 
requests shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Adjustment as set out in Section 1108. 
 
The following criteria shall be used in determining whether to approve a site plan: 
 

A.  Completeness of application information as required under Section 1002.12; 
 
B.  Consistency with adopted policies and standards of the Major Streets and Long Range 
Utilities Plans; 
 
C.  Uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this Ordinance; 
 
D.  Whether the site plan meets applicable design standards established by this 
Ordinance; 
 
E.  Availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development, such 
as roads, sewer, water, schools, solid waste disposal, and fire protection (including access 
to the site for emergency vehicles); and 
 
F.  Compatibility with surrounding land uses (this criterion shall apply only where a site 
plan proposes a conditional use pursuant to Section 1003). 

 
The Planning Director and/or City Engineer may refer any site plan proposal to the Planning 
Commission. 
 
1002.03.  Waiver of Selected Development Standards – Approval By Planning Commission.  
Specific development standards that may be modified with Planning Commission Approval are 
limited to the following:   
 

• bufferyards, including width, planting and required structures; and  
• general and off-street parking landscaping requirements 
• minor parking adjustments (in instances of redevelopment) 
• façade treatments (in instances where buildings in the immediate vicinity are of like 

design) 
 

 
This may be done only upon a specific finding by the Planning Commission that such 
requirements are inappropriate as applied to a particular development site due to its size, 
proposed use, and/or location, and that a waiver would not conflict with the intent of this 
Ordinance or confer upon any property owner a right or privilege denied to neighboring property 
owners within the same district.   
 



May 10, 2021 

X-3 

1002.04.  Pre-design Review.  A pre-application conference shall be required for each site plan 
to be submitted. At that time the staff will provide the applicant or their representative with 
advice and guidance regarding the requirements of this Ordinance, and any other regulations 
which apply.  Preliminary sketches shall be reviewed and overall development concepts finalized 
at this time.   
 
At the pre-design conference, the applicant shall provide the planning department with basic 
information regarding the proposal.  This information should form the basis upon which the staff 
may advise the applicant on the subsequent steps required to gain final site plan approval and the 
necessary information which will be submitted with the formal application.   
 
All requests for waivers or variances should be submitted to the planning department at the pre-
design conference whenever possible.  Upon request, the planning department may waive 
specific site and architectural plan form or information requirements as set forth in this article.  
The planning department may waive any requirement of site plans and architectural plans if it is 
determined that specific requirements are unnecessary due to circumstances unique to the 
property, or if the requirements have been previously submitted and approved.  Such 
requirements may be set aside only to the extent that the intent and purposed of this ordinance 
are not violated. 
 
It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to allow for plenty of time for the pre-application 
conference, and any other available guidance, in order to have a complete application package 
submitted and formal review completed before their desired construction start date. 
  
1002.05.  Formal Submission.  Five (5) folded copies of the site plan, a completed application 
form, a landscape plan and all other necessary attachments, as well as the requisite application 
fees shall be submitted to the Planning Department to initiate processing of the site plan.  
Additional plans shall be provided for review by appropriate state, regional and county agencies 
upon staff request.   
 

A.  Site Plan Preparation Requirements.  Proposed development site plans shall be 
prepared and sealed by an architect, professional engineer or surveyor.  Full engineering 
drawings must be submitted by an engineer registered in the State of Alabama.  The City 
Engineer may choose to require additional information as necessary.   
 
Sketch plans and drawings submitted with variance or other zoning-related applications 
shall not be accepted for review as a site plan unless they are prepared in accordance with 
the guidelines of this Section and contain all required information.  In all cases, 
engineering plans addressing drainage, road construction and other technical aspects of 
development design shall be sealed by a civil engineer registered in the State of Alabama.   
 
B.  Completeness of Plans.  Site plans submitted without complete information in 
accordance with Section 1002.12 shall not be reviewed by the Planning Staff or placed on 
the Planning Commission Agenda.   
 



May 10, 2021 

X-4 

C.  Staff Review.  The Planning Director and other appropriate city staff members shall 
review the site plan with specific regard to this Ordinance and other regulations of the 
City of Northport.  The staff review shall identify matters of development policy concern 
to which the applicant shall address particular attention.   
 
D.  Revised Plans.  Following submission of a complete application package for site plan 
review the Planning staff shall have a minimum of 15 working days in which to complete 
the review and approve the site plan.   

 
 
1002.06.  Approval of Site Plans.  The planning department may approve, approve with 
conditions or disapprove an application as submitted.  For all such applications that are 
disapproved, the reasons for such disapproval shall be provided to the applicant in writing.  For 
all applications that are approved with conditions, the planning department shall indicate the 
nature of the conditions to the applicant in writing.  Except as stipulated in Section 1002.04, no 
site plan shall be approved which is inconsistent with any term contained in this Ordinance 
unless a waiver or variance has been granted in accordance with Sections 1002.03 or 1108 of this 
Ordinance.   
 
Upon approval of a site plan, a minimum of five (5) folded copies, and any additional copies as 
may be required by the city, of the approved site plan shall be submitted to the Planning 
Department prior to issuance of a zoning certificate.  The Planning Director shall stamp, sign and 
date the site plan copies, then forward copies of the site plan to the Engineering and Building 
Inspections Departments.  A minimum of two (2) copies of the site plan shall be reserved for the 
use of the Planning Department.   
 
1002.07.  Effect of Site Plan Approval.  Upon final approval of a site plan, no structures, uses, 
or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development site except in accordance with 
the site plan and related approved plans for development phasing, building construction, grading 
drainage, and other site design elements.   
 
Approved site plans shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval, and a zoning 
certificate and building permit for the development may be obtained during that time period.  
The Planning Director may make an extension of site plan approval for a single period up to six 
(6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire.  An extension may be granted 
only if the Planning Director concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due 
diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a 
new application.  All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 
days before the expiration of the approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension 
request.   
 
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted.  Instead, the applicant 
shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this Section.   
 
Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction 
drawings to the Engineering and Building Inspection Departments for permitting.  These shall 



May 10, 2021 

X-5 

include, but are not limited to, detailed building plans, grading plans, drainage and stormwater 
management facilities, erosion control plans, road and driveway construction specifications, and 
tree removal plans.   
 
Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Building Inspections Department from accepting for 
review and processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical, 
electrical, and plumbing systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions 
as may be established by that department relative to processing of site plans prior to final 
approval.   
 
In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a 
zoning certificate and the site plan has been stamped approved and is on file in the Building 
Inspections Department.  All building and construction permits issued for any project requiring 
site plan review shall be consistent with the stamped approved site plan.  The approval of a site 
plan shall not under any circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the 
applicable City requirements for construction or installation of structures or materials.  
Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such construction details occurs, the more 
restrictive, or that requiring the higher standard, shall prevail.  
 
1002.08.  Modification or Termination of Site Plans.   
 

A.  Site Plan Amendments.  After final approval, any modification, variation or 
adjustment of a stamped approved site plan shall require approval of a site plan 
amendment.   
 
Upon approval of any amendment, the Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall stamp 
and date the most recent version of the site plan, showing the approved amendment, and 
mark all previous copies as “void”.  If appropriate, the Engineering and Building 
Inspections Departments shall be notified of the amendment.   
 
B.  Site Plan Expiration and Cancellation.  In the event of a change to these regulations 
the site plan shall be valid under the regulations for which it was approved for 18 months 
from the date of such approval.  Upon expiration of the site plan and any extension that 
may have been granted, the Planning Director shall make appropriate records in the 
Planning Department files stamp all available copies of the site plan as “void”, and notify 
the Engineering and Building Inspections Departments of the expiration.   
 
The applicant may cancel the site plan at any time between the date of final approval and 
the date of expiration by submitting a written request to the Planning Director. Upon 
receipt of this request by the Planning Director, the site plan shall be treated as expired.  

 
 
1002.09.  Integration of Other Review Procedures.  Any site plan to be built in stages or 
requiring variance or conditional use approval shall be coordinated as set forth below:   
 



May 10, 2021 

X-6 

A.  Development Built in Stages.  As part of the application for site plan approval, the 
developer shall submit a proposed stage plan, including a schedule for completion of all 
improvements.  If the site plan proposes any of the performance residential housing types 
described in Section 603.02 (A) through (F), a Master Development Plan pursuant to 
Section 604 shall also be required.  Once a stage plan has been approved, no land may be 
used and no building may be occupied except in accordance with such plan.  At the 
Planning Director’s discretion, a new site plan may be required for each successive stage 
of the development.   
 
Stage configurations shall be logical and consistent with the purposes of this Ordinance.  
If appropriate, the Planning Director may stipulate that any or all portions of the required 
landscaping and/or bufferyards be provided during the first stage of development, even 
though some bufferyards or portions thereof lie outside the stage.  Each stage, at a 
minimum, must include adequate parking, drainage facilities, landscaping, and all other 
features needed to serve that portion of the total development.   
 
Prior to approval for construction of any one stage, an engineering stage plan shall be 
submitted to and approved by the City Engineer.  This plan shall address site grading, 
erosion control, stormwater management, internal traffic circulation, and any other design 
elements required by the City Engineer.   
 
In approving a stage plan, the Planning Commission or Planning staff may specify certain 
site improvements to be provided at a percentage rate exceeding that of construction of 
the overall development.  These items may be elements of engineering design, or 
requirements of this Ordinance.   Such improvements include, but are not limited to 
parking, drainage facilities, erosion control measures, landscaping and bufferyards.  
Where the applicant has agreed to provide off-site improvements, such as traffic signals, 
turn lanes, and sewer lines, the Planning Commission or Planning Director may require 
such improvements to be in place upon completion of any stage of the development.   
 
B.  Variance.  Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this 
Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted 
upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with Section 1108 of this 
Ordinance.  This shall include existing development sites, proposed for expansion or 
reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance.  The site 
plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the variance request, but 
the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved.   
 
C.  Conditional Uses.  For developments requiring approval of a conditional use, a 
request for such approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission; and the 
Commission shall make a recommendation to City Council on such request.  The Council 
shall act on the conditional use request prior to final approval of the site plan.  A site plan 
and a conditional use request may be processed concurrently. 
 

1002.10.  Non-Compliance.  Failure to comply with a stamped approved site plan or any of the 
conditions upon which such approval was contingent, including time limits for performance, 



May 10, 2021 

X-7 

shall be cause to deny issuance of a zoning certificate or, where a zoning certificate has been 
issued pursuant to a stamped approved site plan, to render such zoning certificate invalid.  Any 
action, construction, development or use of property undertaken in violation of the provisions of 
this Section for a site plan shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and may be subject to a 
stop-work order.   
 
1002.11.  Development Site To Be Unified.   
 

A.  Internal Division of Ownership.  Except as provided in this section, the 
development site shall remain unified by title under one (1) owner, or by multiple owners 
holding a percentage interest in the site as a whole.  Where a development site consists of 
two (2) or more existing lots under the same ownership, all such lots shall be combined in 
accordance with the Subdivision Regulations prior to final approval of the site plan.   
 
Where spatial division of ownership within a development site is proposed, the owners of 
all component properties shall accept the following conditions in receiving site plan 
approval:   

 
1.  No individual property will be used or developed in any way that is not consistent 

with the approved site plan. 
 
2. Development rights on each parcel are combined with those of the balance of the 

development site, and the City will consider no separate development proposals 
unless the development site can be divided in accordance with the provisions of 
this Ordinance.  

 
3. No parcel of land within a development site shall be subdivided, sold or otherwise 

conveyed for the purpose of new development that is not authorized under the 
approved site plan.  

 
All owners of property within the development site shall authorize one (1) person, 
designated as the applicant, to represent them collectively before the Planning 
Commission and other City officials in all matters related to the site plan and 
development site.  In the event the designated applicant is not an owner of the subject 
property then a notarized “Authorization to Act as Applicant” must be completed and 
signed by the owner(s). 
 
 B.  External Ownership.  When the development site is part of a larger parcel of 
property, of which a portion is not intended to be included within the site plan, this 
unused area shall become a separate lot, meeting any relevant size and dimensional 
requirements of this Ordinance, to be approved in accordance with the Subdivision 
Regulations.  This subdivision process shall be completed prior to final approval of the 
site plan.   
 
C.  Development Site To Be Complete.  The development site shall be designed to 
provide all required amenities and facilities, including bufferyards, open space, and 



May 10, 2021 

X-8 

landscaping.  No such required features shall be located off-site or on adjacent properties 
which are leased, rented, or otherwise proposed for use on an informal basis, except as 
provided for in Section 611.03 Shared Parking.  The entire site shall have the zoning 
designation required to accommodate the principal use.   
 
D.  Division After Approval.  No development site, once granted site plan approval, 
shall be divided except through the site plan amendment process established in Section 
1002.08. 

 
1002.12.  Site Plan Preparation Requirements.  A site plan must accurately show all relevant 
information about a proposed development to permit it to be reviewed against the requirements 
of this Ordinance, and to provide a permanent record as to the type and characteristics of 
development approved on the site.  Site plans shall be drawn, on one of the following overall 
sheet sizes 22”x 34”, 24”x 36”, or 36”x 48”, and at a scale no smaller than 1:50.  
 
When more than one (1) sheet is needed, a series of drawings showing different elements of the 
site design, such as landscaping, utilities, or topography may be submitted.  Where such a series 
is submitted, the top sheet shall include an index of all other sheets in the series.  These shall be 
bound in a single package, with each sheet labeled as to what it shows and its number in the 
series (e.g., Landscaping Plan, Sheet 2 of 3).  Information shown on Drawings included in 
construction plan (i.e. grading plans, utility plans, etc.) will not be considered as meeting the 
requirement for a site plan submission.  Required site plan details must be shown on the “site 
plan” drawing. 
 
Unless specifically waived by the Planning Director, the following information shall be shown 
on all site plans:   
 

A.  Written Information:    
 

1.  Site plan name. 
 

2.  General statement indicating the character of the use(s) proposed for the site.  
This shall include information describing the size and/or intensity of the use, 
such as the number of employees at largest shift, seating capacity, number of 
students, number of hospital beds or motel rooms, etc.  All other relevant 
information not otherwise specified in this checklist shall be provided in the 
General Statement, such as variances on the property, nonconforming status, 
etc. 

 
3.  Property owner’s name, address and telephone number; and the designated 

project applicant or representative if other than the property owner. 
 
4.  Name, address, and telephone number of engineer, surveyor, architect, 

landscape architect and/or any other professional involved in design of the 
project.  Include current license numbers.

Section 1002.13.  Design Review Standards.   
 

A.  Site Standards.  The standards for site plans listed below are intended only as minimum 
requirements, so that the general development pattern in the city may be adjusted to a wide 
variety of circumstances and topography, and to ensure reasonable and orderly growth.   

 
1. All proposed development shall meet or exceed the city's most current  zoning 

ordinance, subdivision regulations and any other city ordinance as may pertain to 
such developments, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

 



May 10, 2021 

X-17 

2. Applications shall state the estimated increase in vehicle trips per day to the subject 
property which would be generated by the proposed development. Further, the 
applicant shall also provide for the necessary engineering studies needed to determine 
that entrances and exits onto public streets do not unduly increase congestion or 
traffic hazards to the public streets and the proposed site. Such requirements for 
engineering studies may be waived by the planning department where the proposed 
use is not expected to contribute substantially to traffic and the spirit of this ordinance 
is not unduly compromised. 

 
Entrances, internal roads, and driveways shall be constructed to accommodate 
anticipated traffic flows after the development is complete. Preparation of plans and 
specifications are the responsibility of the applicant. 

 
Applicants may be required to install, at their own expense, turn lanes, street 
intersection lights, signs, and other improvements necessary to handle the increased 
traffic and potential traffic hazards. 
 

3.   The proposed development shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of 
the city's erosion control ordinance. 

 
4.   Developers shall provide for fences, landscaping and other improvements as are 

necessary to buffer the proposed use from the existing or surrounding land uses as set 
forth in Article V, "Landscaping Requirements", of the zoning ordinance. 

 
5.   Lighting facilities and lighted signs shall be placed and shielded in such a manner, 

and of such a height and intensity, as not to cause direct light to shine on other 
properties to the extent a public nuisance is created or a safety hazard is created on a 
public street. Lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the design objective of this 
article. 

 
6.   To the greatest extent possible, utilities should be placed underground, unless the 

applicant can demonstrate that it is unfeasible due to the costs or other constraints. 
 
7.   The proposed development shall be designed to prevent danger from fire, explosion, 

or other safety hazards to the general public, and the persons residing or working on 
surrounding property. 

 
8.   Loading docks, garbage collection areas and similar facilities and functions should to 

the greatest extent possible, be incorporated into the overall design of the building 
and the landscaping, so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are 
fully contained and are not visible from adjacent properties or public streets. In the 
event that the collection areas enclose dumpsters or other equipment, screening shall 
be at least two feet taller than the equipment and not less than six feet in height. Use 
of screening materials should be consistent with the principal materials of the 
building and landscaping. 

 



May 10, 2021 

X-18 

9.  Applicants may be required to install, at their own expense, sidewalks and half-street 
improvements as described in Section 618 of the Northport Subdivision Regulations 
as deemed necessary by the Planning Director or City Engineer. 
a. Fee-in-Lieu of Sidewalks. 

1. When one or more of the following conditions are present, the 
developer may request approval from Planning Commission of a fee-
in-lieu arrangement in the form of a waiver, whereby the developer 
shall make a contribution toward the Sidewalk Trust Fund in lieu of 
requiring installation of sidewalks: 

a. When the project site is not located on a priority pedestrian 
corridor as designated by the most current regional bicycle 
and pedestrian plan; 

b. When requesting a subdivision consisting of five or fewer 
lots; 

c. When there are no sidewalks currently installed on 
adjoining properties; 

d. When existing public infrastructure currently prohibits 
construction of sidewalks as determined by the Public 
Works Director and/or City Engineer; 

e. When topography and/or terrain does not allow the 
installation of ADA compliant sidewalks as determined by 
a licensed civil engineer and agreed upon by the City 
Engineer; 

f. When other circumstances make sidewalk installation 
unreasonable or inappropriate, as determined by the 
Planning Director and/or City Engineer. 

2. Such fee-in-lieu arrangement shall be based on the total cost of 
sidewalk installation, as determined by the City Engineer.  

3. The developer shall have the choice of either installing the sidewalks 
or paying to the City the fee-in-lieu of such sidewalk installation, 
prior to any certificate of occupancy being issued for structures in 
any phase abutting the right-of-way within which the sidewalks are 
required. 

 
B.  Architectural standards.  The standards of this section are intended to promote the 
health, safety and welfare of citizens by setting limited guidelines for construction with an 
emphasis on aesthetics. The guidelines may be supplemented or superseded by the planning 
commission and/or city council by specific design guidelines applicable to specific uses or 
portions of the city as set out herein.   

 
1.   Height and massing.     

 
a.   Shall conform to the height requirements of each district. 



May 10, 2021 

X-19 

 
b.   Multifamily, commercial and office structures shall be designed to be compatible 
and consistent with the architectural style and character of single family residential 
structures in the immediate vicinity. The exterior of multifamily structures may be 
designed to appear as a single building, such as a large single family detached 
dwelling. 

 
c.   Lengthy unbroken facades should be avoided. As a general guide, the maximum 
horizontal length of an unbroken facade plane should be 50 feet in residential 
districts, and 75 feet in commercial and office districts. Facade offsets shall be 
sufficient to create a strong shadow line. 

 
d.   Buildings on corner lots shall be considered more significant structures, due to the 
fact that they have at least two front facades visibly exposed to the street. It is 
strongly encouraged that such buildings be designed with additional height and 
architectural embellishments, such as corner towers, relating to their location. 

 
e.   Buildings should be located to front towards and relate to public streets, both 
functionally and visually, to the greatest extent possible. 

 
2.   Roofs.     

 
a.   The pitch and style of roofs should be consistent with that of surrounding 
structures. Generally roofs should project enough beyond the facade to cast a shadow 
and shall be of a color which would be consistent and compatible with the natural 
environment. 

 
b.   Architectural embellishments which add visual interest to roofs, such as dormers, 
belvederes, masonry chimneys, cupolas, clock towers and other similar elements are 
strongly encouraged. 

 
c.   Mechanical equipment should be concealed from public streets within the volume 
of the roof or enclosed within penthouse structures or screening that will substantially 
eliminate visibility of the equipment from public streets. 

 
 
 
3.   Facades.    

  
a.   Front facades should be architecturally emphasized through fenestration, entrance 
treatments and details. Architectural elements such as doorways, dormers, gables, and 
porches should be used to effectively articulate facades and reduce the scale of larger 
structures. Diverse architectural treatments should be integrated to avoid a cluttered 
appearance. 

 



May 10, 2021 

X-20 

b.   The architectural treatment of the front facade should be continued, in its major 
features, around all sides of a building that are visible from a public street. It is 
recommended that all sides of a building should be architecturally designed to be 
consistent with regard to style, materials, colors and details. Blank wall or service 
area treatment of side and/or rear elevations, visible from a public street is 
discouraged. 

 
c.   Fenestration should be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, color 
and details of the building. Windows should be vertically proportioned wherever 
possible. To the greatest extent possible, upper story windows should be vertically 
aligned with the location of windows and doors on the ground level, including 
storefront or display windows. 

 
d.   Blank, windowless walls are discouraged. If necessitated by local building codes, 
the wall should be articulated by the provision of blank window openings trimmed 
with frames, sills and lintels. 

 
e.   Each principal commercial building should have a highly visible customer 
entrance. All entrances to a building should be defined and articulated by 
architectural elements such as lintels, pediments, pilasters, columns, porticos, 
porches, overhangs, railings, balustrades and other similar elements. Any such 
element utilized should be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors 
and details of the building as a whole, including the doors. 

 
4.   Materials.  Materials such as brick, stone and wood are preferred. Developers are 

encouraged to vary materials from building to building while limiting the number of different 
materials on any individual structure.  In all instances the use of loud, garish colors on 
exterior façade materials shall be prohibited.  Metal siding shall be prohibited on all sides of 
a building which are visible from any public street except under the following conditions: 

 
Metal siding shall be allowed in industrial zones only (M-1 or M-2) for buildings under 

the following conditions: 
• A minimum base of four feet or 30% of wall height, whichever is greater, of brick, 

stone, split face block, or other durable material (not smooth finish concrete masonry units or 
smooth concrete) shall be located on the sides facing a public street; if a multi-story building, 
the first story must meet this material requirement 

• No exterior wall plane facing a public street may exceed thirty feet without an 
interruption or articulation.  Examples include: wall offsets, material changes, pilasters, 
columns/posts, roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches. 

• If an industrial zone is located adjacent to a residential zone, the front or main façade 
shall not have any metal siding (architectural metal panels are allowed). 

 
Architectural metal panels shall be allowed in commercial zones (C-2, C-3, or C-6) under 

the following conditions: 
• A minimum base of four feet or 30% of wall height, whichever is greater, of brick, 

stone, split face block, or other durable material (not smooth finish concrete masonry units or 



May 10, 2021 

X-21 

concrete) shall be located on all sides visible from a public street; if a multi-story building, 
the first story must meet this material requirement 

• No exterior wall plane visible from a public street may exceed thirty feet without an 
interruption or articulation.  Examples include: wall offsets, material changes, pilasters, 
columns/posts, roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches, fenestrations.

6.  Landscaping standards.  See Landscape Bufferyard Article V 

 
7.  Signage.  See Sign Article VIII 

 
 
 
Section 1003.  Conditional Uses.   
 
Conditional uses are those uses that have some special impact which differs from the potential 
impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have uniqueness such that their effect 
on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a 
particular location.   
 
Upon submission of a request for conditional use approval, a review of the location, design, 
configuration, and impact shall be conducted to determine whether the proposed use would have 
a detrimental impact on neighboring properties.   
 
The review considers the proposal in terms of: 

• existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use;  
• planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by 

the proposed use;  
• whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is 

consistent with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and; any other development policies 
and/or regulations of the City of Northport; and  

• whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to 
minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the 
public health, safety, and welfare in general. 

 
Section 1003.01.  Applicability.  Any use designated as a conditional use by Table 4-1 of this 
Ordinance shall comply with this Section.   
 
In addition, the following shall be approved only as conditional uses:   
 

A.  Any use that involves filling of a floodplain.   
 

B.  Any performance residential use. 
  



May 10, 2021 

X-22 

Section 1003.02.  Procedures.  Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted and 
approved prior to application for a zoning certificate.  A subdivision plat, or a site plan meeting 
the requirements of Section 1002 shall support applications for conditional uses in all districts.  
Site plan or subdivision approval shall not be granted prior to or contingent upon conditional use 
approval. 
 
The Planning Director shall process applications for a conditional use permit as follows:   
 

A.  Applications for a conditional use permit must be submitted to the Planning 
Department not later than the 2nd Tuesday of the month proceeding the month in which 
the case is to be heard.  Copies of the application shall be distributed to the appropriate 
departments.   
 
B.  A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission after adjoining property 
owners have been notified of the public hearing by certified mail.  Not later than seven 
(7) days prior to the date set for the hearing on the application, the Planning Director 
shall file a written report thereon with the Planning Commission.   As a courtesy, signs 
announcing the public hearing may be placed on the property in question 
 
C.  The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds that the application 
and record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance.  Further, the 
application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any 
mitigating conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission, outweigh any 
public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall 
public health, safety, and welfare.   
 
D.  In order to prevent or minimize adverse effects on other properties in the 
neighborhood and on the general health, safety, and welfare of the City of Northport, the 
Planning Commission may impose such restrictions and conditions on approval of the 
proposed use as it determines are required by the general purposes, goals, and objectives 
of this Ordinance.  All conditions imposed upon any conditional use permit approval, 
except those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in 
the resolution granting such conditional use permits.   
 
E.  The Planning Commission shall render to the City Council its recommendation to 
grant the application for a conditional use permit, grant it subject to conditions, or deny it.   
Following a public hearing at the City Council upon an Ordinance for Conditional Use 
Approval, the City Council shall either approve, or disapprove, the application and shall 
establish the specific conditions under which the application is approved.   
 
F.  In the event a permit for a conditional use is approved or approved subject to 
conditions, the applicant shall submit a site plan meeting all conditions of approval. The 
Planning Director shall then take action to process the application on the zoning 
certificate for the development to which the conditional use permit applies.  In the event 
such permit is not approved or is approved subject to conditions that are not acceptable to 
the applicant, the applicant may, either appeal such decision or abandon the application.  



May 10, 2021 

X-23 

Appeals must be filed with and received by the Planning Department within fifteen (15) 
days of said decision. 

 
Section 1003.03.  Conditions on Conditional Use Approvals.  Every conditional use permit 
shall be contingent upon the proposed development fully complying with all requirements of this 
Ordinance and, where applicable, with the Subdivision Regulations.  The violation of any 
condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance.   
 
Section 1003.04.  General Use Standards.   No application for a conditional use permit shall be 
approved unless the City Council shall specifically find the proposed conditional use appropriate 
in the location for which it is proposed.  This finding shall be based on the following criteria:   
 

A.  The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and 
standards of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or 
under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City.   
 
B.  The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue 
adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, 
parking, public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the 
public health, safety, and general welfare; either as they now exist or as they may in the 
future be developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this 
Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under 
consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other governmental agency 
having jurisdiction to guide growth and development.   
 
C.  The proposed use will be adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden 
on any of the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection.  
Where any such improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or 
adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part 
of the application and as a condition to approval of the proposed conditional use permit, 
be responsible for establishing ability, willingness, and bind commitment to provide such 
improvements, facilities, utilities, and services in sufficient time and in a manner 
consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, programs, maps, and ordinances adopted 
by the City to guide its growth and development.  The approval of the conditional use 
permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services 
being provided and guaranteed by the applicant.   
 
D.  The Planning Commission may attach to any recommendation for conditional use 
approval, additional criteria dealing with bufferyards, parking, lighting, building 
materials, or any other aspect of site plan approval they deem necessary to mitigate the 
impact of the proposed conditional use on the surrounding property. 

 
 
1003.05.  Conditional Use Approval to Run with Land.  Conditional use approvals are issued 
for uses of land and may be transferable from one owner of the land to another.  All conditions 
place on said approval, including specific use types, shall be applicable to any new owner or 



May 10, 2021 

X-24 

developer.  Any change to plans or uses by any owner shall, at the recommendation of the 
Planning Director, require re-approval through the normal approval process for Conditional Use. 
 
1003.06.  Filling of Floodplain.  The filling of areas within the 100-year floodplain shall be 
approved only where plans and specifications have been submitted that meet all requirements of 
Section 412 and where the following conditions exist which necessitate the filling of the 
floodplain:   
 

A.  The property would otherwise be able to accommodate at least one residential 
dwelling with a lot meeting all requirements of Articles IV and VI but cannot, because of 
the floodplain, accommodate even one single-family unit; or,   
 
B.  That the location and/or configuration of the buildable land are such that the intensity 
of the permitted land use cannot be realized without filling in the floodplain 
 

Section 1004.  Zoning Certificates.   
 
No development permitted by this Ordinance, including accessory and temporary uses, may be 
established and no existing building may be altered with respect to its use after the effective date 
of this Ordinance until a zoning certificate has been secured from the Planning Director.   
 
 Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the additional responsibility of seeking any permit 
required by any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulations in compliance with all of the terms 
of this Ordinance.  Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other 
ordinances.    
 
The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this 
Ordinance. 
 
 
Section 1005.  Certificate of Occupancy.   
 
No land or building for which a zoning certificate has been issued shall be occupied or used in 
whole or in part for any use whatsoever after the effective date of this Ordinance until the owner, 
tenants, contract purchaser, or authorized agent thereof has been issued a certificate of 
occupancy by the Chief Building Inspector, or his/her designee, indicating that the building or 
use complies with all zoning requirements of this Ordinance, the building code, and other 
applicable codes and regulations.   
 
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the premises in question have been inspected 
and found by the Senior Building Inspector to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.

As a precondition to approval of any site plan, subdivision plat, zoning certificate, building 
permit, or any other type of development permit, any development site shall have legal access to 
a publicly owned and maintained road.  Physical access alone shall not qualify any development

1006.01.  Access Easements.  Access by easement shall be approved only by specific action of 
the Planning Commission, and where normal requirements cannot be met.  In all such cases, the 
following conditions shall apply:    
 

 A.  The property owner seeking a permit shall possess a valid legal instrument, recorded 
in the Office of the Judge of Probate, indicating ownership of an access strip or easement 
at least 15 feet in width connecting the subject property with a public road;   
 
B.  No such access shall serve more than one (1) building site;   
 
C.  No development shall be authorized on any such building site other than one (1) 
single family dwelling and permitted accessory structures;   
 
D.  Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the access shall be graded and/or 
covered with a suitable surface so as to be passable to emergency vehicles; and   
 
E.  The permit applicant shall sign a statement indicating that the City of Northport has 
no obligation to repair and/or maintain the access in a usable condition, and that the City 
shall not be liable for injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from the site’s 
lack of direct access to a public road. 

 
   
Section 1007.  Fees.   
 
A schedule of application fees for site plan and subdivision approval, zoning certificates, and 
other permits and public hearings required under this Ordinance shall be established by separate 
resolution or ordinance.  This fee schedule shall be computed so as to recover all costs incurred

Section 1106.  Interpretations.   
 
1106.01.  Purpose.  The provisions of this section are intended to provide a simple and 
expeditious method for clarifying ambiguities in the text of this Ordinance, the zoning map 
which it incorporates, and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to it.  It is also intended to 
provide a simple procedure for overcoming rigidities and limitations of finite use lists. 
 
 1106.02.  Authority.  The Planning Director may, subject to the procedures, standards, and 
limitations set forth in this Section, render interpretations of any provision of this Ordinance or 
any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it, including interpretations of the various uses in any 
district not expressly mentioned in this Ordinance. 
 
 1106.03.  Procedure.   
 

A.  Written Request for Non-Use Interpretation.  Except as provided below, a request for 
interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance, the zoning map, or any rule or 
regulation adopted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be submitted in writing to the 
Planning Director.  No fee shall be required in connection with any such request.  Each 
such request shall set forth the specific provision or provisions to be interpreted, the facts 
of the specific situation giving rise to the request for an interpretation, and the precise 
interpretation claimed by the applicant to be correct.  Before rendering any interpretation, 
the Planning Director shall receive such further facts and information as are in his/her 
judgment necessary to a meaningful interpretation of the provision in question.   

 
B.  Application for Use Interpretation.  Applications for a use interpretation shall be 
submitted to the Planning Director and shall, in all instances, contain at least the 
following information and documentation:   

 
1. The applicant’s names, address, and interest in the subject property. 
 
2.  The owner’s name and address, if different from the applicant’s, and the 

owner’s signed consent to the filing of the application. 
 
3.  The names and addresses of all professional consultants advising the applicant 

with respect to the interpretation. 
 
4.  The street address and legal description of the subject property. 
 
5.  The zoning classification and present use of the subject property. 
 
6.  A complete description of the proposed use. 
 



May 10, 2021 

XI-7 

7.  The uses permitted by the present zoning classification, which are most similar 
to the proposed use. 

 
8.  Documents, statements, and other evidence demonstrating that the proposed 

use will comply with all use limitations established for the district in which it is 
proposed to be located. 

 
9.  Such other and further information or documentation as the Planning Director 

may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and 
disposition of the particular application.                

 
C.  Planning Director.  Within 30 days following the receipt of a completed request or 
application for interpretation, a written interpretation shall be mailed to the applicant.  
The specific precedent, reasons, and analysis on which such interpretation is based shall 
be stated.  At the discretion of the Planning Director such requests for interpretation may 
be referred to the Planning Commission for review and interpretation. 
 
Failure to render an interpretation within the aforementioned time, or such longer period 
of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed to be a rejection of the 
applicant’s proposed interpretation.  The Planning Director shall keep a copy of each 
such interpretation on file and shall make a copy of each such file interpretation available 
for public inspection during normal business hours.     

 
D.  Appeal.  Appeals on interpretations rendered by the Planning Director, or other 
responsible staff, pursuant to this Section may be taken to the Board of Zoning 
Adjustment as provided in this Article. 

 
1106.04.  Conditions on Use Interpretations.  The following conditions shall govern the Board 
of Zoning Adjustment on appeals from the Planning Director, in issuing use interpretations:   
 

A.  No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use that was previously 
considered and rejected by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on an application for 
amendment.   
 
B.  No use interpretation shall permit a use in any district in which such use is not listed 
either as permitted or conditional in Table 4-1.   
 
C.  No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be 
presented which demonstrates that it will comply with each use limitation established for 
the particular district.   
 
D.  No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is 
substantially similar to other uses permitted in such district and is more similar to such 
other uses than to uses permitted or conditionally permitted in a more restrictive district.   
 



May 10, 2021 

XI-8 

E.  If the proposed use is more similar to a conditional use than a permitted use in the 
district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation permitting such 
use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a conditional use permit.   
 
F.  Any use permitted pursuant to this Section shall fully comply with all requirements 
and standards imposed by this Ordinance.   

 
1106.05.  Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation.  No use interpretation finding a particular 
use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific district shall authorize the 
establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving 
of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of 
applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by the codes and ordinances 
of the City of Northport, or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction.  These permits and 
approvals include, but are not limited to, zoning certificates, conditional use permits, building 
permits, and certificates of occupancy.   
 
1106.06.  Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations.  No use interpretation finding a 
particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified district shall supersede 
subsequent amendment to this Ordinance. 
 
   
Section 1107.  Amendments.   
 
This Ordinance may be amended from time to time as conditions warrant in the following 
manner.  As used herein, the term “application” includes City Council resolution/ordinance.   
 

A.  Application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance or zoning map of the City of 
Northport shall be made on forms furnished by the planning department, and shall 
include a proper legal description of the subject lot or tract of land.  Additionally, all 
required fees and any other graphic information requested by the Planning Director shall 
be submitted along with the completed application. 

 
B.  Initiation Procedures.  A proposed change to the zoning district boundaries or of the 
regulations may be initiated by the City Council, the Northport Planning Commission, or 
by petition of one or more owners, or authorized agents of such owners, of property 
within the area proposed to be changed.   

 
C.  Text Amendments.  The application for an amendment to the text of this Ordinance 
shall state in particular the article, section, subsection, and paragraph sought to be 
amended.  The application shall contain the language of the proposed amendment and 
shall recite the reasons for such proposed change in the text.   

 
D.  Map Amendments.   

 
1. Applications to rezone any property, or any application which seeks to change 

or modify the standards and requirements imposed on a particular piece of 



May 10, 2021 

XI-9 

property by the text and maps of this Ordinance, including applications for 
variances and conditional use permits, may be instituted by the City of 
Northport or all the owners of the property sought to be affected, or their 
assigns.   

 
2. In the case where the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, said 

applicant shall secure a notarized authorization to act as applicant from the 
property owner, along with the regularly required copy of the deed for the 
property.   

 
3. When a development proposal involves approval of a site plan or subdivision 

plat in addition to a zoning map amendment, no site plan or subdivision plat 
approval shall be granted prior to approval of the map amendment.  If a 
development plan and the corresponding request for zoning change are to be 
addressed at the same public hearing, the Planning Commission shall render a 
decision on the zoning application before considering any related site plan or 
subdivision plat.  Such decision shall be based on the requirements of the 
Comprehensive Plan, this Ordinance and the full range of uses permitted in the 
requested district, and not on the specific development concept proposed by the 
applicant.   

 
4.  All properties annexed into the City of Northport shall be classified as RS-1, 

single-family residential, or such other district that is specifically requested by 
the petitioner(s) in the annexation petition. All requests for annexation of land 
into zones other than RS-1, shall meet all requirements for map amendments 
set forth in Section 1107.01.  Council shall give consideration to the 
comprehensive plan for that area when considering a zoning classification 
other than RS-1. 

 
D.  Public Hearing.  Upon application, the Planning Commission shall, after giving seven 
(7) days notice, conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment.  The Planning 
Commission shall consider and make recommendations on all proposed amendments, 
taking into account:  (1) the testimony at the hearing; (2) a site inspection of the property 
in question; (3) the recommendations from interested official bodies; (4) compliance with 
the Comprehensive Plan and (5) the standards provided below. 

 
1107.01.  Standards for Map Amendments.   
 

A.  No request, other than those made by the city council, planning commission, planning 
director, or any department or agency of the city, for a change in zoning classification or 
creation of a separate district shall be considered which involves an area of less than two 
acres, except in the following cases: 
 
 1.  The extension of existing district boundaries; 

2.  The addition of O-I or C-2 zoning contiguous to existing commercial or 
industrial zones. 



May 10, 2021 

XI-10 

3.  The zoning of an existing lot of record, surrounded by unzoned property, 
which was outside the municipal limits and is requesting annexation. 

 
B.  No rezoning of land to the Manufacturing (M) District shall be permitted except on a 
specific and documented finding that:   

 
1. There is an inadequate supply of land zoned for these uses or the proposed use 

cannot be accommodated by those sites due to lack of transportation, water, or 
sewer, or that the market area to be served by the proposed use cannot be 
efficiently served by the geographical location of the existing Industrial 
District.   

 
2. Roads, floodplains, or other existing or planned features will insure sufficient 

buffering to protect surrounding land and uses from the negative impacts of the 
proposed industrial use.   

 
C. There shall be no rezoning of land from Agricultural (AG) to any other district until 

such time as adequate public utilities are available. 
 
1107.02. Annexation 
 

The following requirements must be fulfilled for a petition to be considered 
by the Planning Commission. 
 
A.  Ownership.  The petitioner must be the owner of the property, and must 
submit an accurate description of the property proposed for annexation. This 
requirement can be met by submitting a survey and a legal description 
prepared and signed by a surveyor registered in the State of Alabama; or a 
legally recorded subdivision plat showing the property in question. 
 
B.  Contiguity.  The property to be annexed must be contiguous to the 
existing corporate boundary of the City of Northport. For this purpose the 
term "contiguous" means either: 
 

1. A boundary of the property proposed for annexation adjoins the 
existing corporate boundary of the City of Northport for a distance of at 
least one (1) foot; or, 
 
2. At least one (1) foot of the boundary of the property proposed for 
annexation is directly across the right-of-way of a publicly dedicated 
street, or a railroad, or across from a creek or river, a utility right-of-way, 
or similar natural boundary from the existing corporate boundary of the 
City of Northport.  
 



May 10, 2021 

XI-11 

3. A strip of land at least sixty (60) feet wide connects the property 
proposed for annexation to the corporate boundary of the City of 
Northport; and the connecting strip is included in the annexation petition. 

 
C.  Review of Petitions.  Each annexation petition will be submitted to all 
City department heads for review and comment. All such comments will be 
presented to the Planning Commission and City Council for consideration in 
making a decision. 
 
D.  Property Located in a Fire District.  If the property requested to be 
annexed lies within the territory of a fire district, other than the Northport 
Fire District, the property owner must provide proof that they have been 
released from said fire district prior to a petition for annexation being 
processed.  Proof may be provided in the form of written documentation 
from the Board of Directors of the Fire District certifying that such a release 
has been granted and that all fees associated with said release have been paid 
in full.  In the event the applicant fails to remove the property from any fire 
district prior to annexation, applicant shall reimburse the City for all costs, 
including all attorneys’ fees, for the removal by the City of this property 
from any fire district after annexation. 
 
E.  Guidelines for Review.  The following guidelines will be used by the 
Planning Commission in reviewing petitions for annexation. 
 

1. Zoning Classification.  All properties annexed into the City of 
Northport shall be classified as RS-1, single-family residential, or 
such other district that is specifically requested by the 
petitioner(s) in the annexation petition. All requests for 
annexation of land into zones other than RS-1, shall meet all 
requirements for map amendments set forth in Section 1107.01.  
Council shall give consideration to the comprehensive plan for 
that area when considering a zoning classification other than RS-
1. 

 
2. Minimum Area.  If the property for which annexation is being 

requested is less than three (3) acres in area, consideration should 
only be given to annexation of the entire parcel. 

 
If the property for which annexation is being requested is more 
than three (3) acres in area, consideration will be given to 
annexing a portion of said property. However, neither the portion 
recommended for annexation, nor the portion remaining 
unincorporated, should be less than three (3) acres; nor should the 
annexation of such portion make it unduly difficult for other 
property owners in the vicinity to achieve the degree of contiguity 
necessary to make their property eligible for annexation. 



May 10, 2021 

XI-12 

 
3. Public Access.  The property for which annexation is being 

requested should have direct access to a public right-of-way. For 
this purpose the term "direct access" means fronting on a 
dedicated public right-of-way; or having an unrestricted 
connection to a public right-of-way, capable of providing safe and 
ready access for public service vehicles, and approved by the 
Planning Commission. 

 
1107.03.  Report of the Planning Commission.     
 

A.  The Planning Commission shall make a report to the City Council outlining the 
proposed amendment.  No amendment shall be passed except by a majority vote of the 
members of the City Council present. 
 
B.  The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed 
amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public 
interest and not solely for the interest of the applicant. 
 
C.  For each disapproved map amendment, the Planning Commission shall make findings 
on each of the following matters based on the evidence presented to it: 

 
1.  The proposed amendment’s ability to uphold the policies of the 

Comprehensive Plan. 
 
2. The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the 

proposed zoning.   
 
3. The adequacy of public facilities, such as sewer and water, and other required 

public services. 
 
 
Section 1108.  Variances.   
 
1108.01.  Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to empower the Board of Zoning Adjustment 
to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this Ordinance.  It is expected 
that the granting of variances will be rare.  However, a variance may be appropriate where, by 
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape; or by reason of other exceptional 
topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece 
of property, the strict application of any regulation enacted under this Ordinance would result in 
peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner’s use of such property.   
 
Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction 
with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Board of Zoning 
Adjustment prior to approval of any such site plan.  This shall include existing development 
sites, proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement of

XI-13 

this Ordinance.  The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the 
variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved. 
 
1108.02.  Application.  Any property owner may apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a 
variance using forms to be obtained from the Department of Planning & Inspections. 
Applications must be submitted by noon on the date of the applicable deadline for the meeting at 
which it is to be heard.   All required fees and any other information requested by the Planning 
Director shall be submitted along with the completed application. 
 
1108.03.  Standards for Variances.  The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in 
the strict application of the provision of this Ordinance unless it finds that the following 
requirements and standards are satisfied.  In general, the power to authorize a variance from the 
terms of this Ordinance shall be sparingly exercised.  It is the intent of this Ordinance that the 
variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which 
poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property as 
intended by the Zoning Ordinance.  Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment 
necessary for the reasonable use of the land.   
 
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that 
practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted.  In particular, the 
applicant shall establish and substantiate in writing that the appeal for the variance conforms to 
all of the requirements and standards listed below:   
 

A.  The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent 
of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and 
shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.   

 
B.  The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use, which is not 
permitted in the district.   

 
C.  There must be proof of unique circumstances:  there must exist special circumstances 
or conditions fully described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which 
the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or 
buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the district, and which 
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this 
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.   

 
D.  There must be proof of unnecessary hardship.  It is not sufficient proof of hardship to 
show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted.  Furthermore, the 
hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by 
one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions; it must result from the 
application of this Ordinance; it must be suffered directly by the property in question; and 
evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered.

E.  That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or 
building and that the variance as granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment is the 
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.   

 
F.  That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to 
adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the 
danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property 
values within the adjacent neighborhood.   

 
G.  That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any 
special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in 
the same district.   

 
The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the 
objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.   
 
1108.04.  Public Hearing.  Upon application, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall schedule a 
public hearing on the proposed variance to be held at least ten (10) days after a public notice has 
been published in the local newspaper, and after the adjacent property owners most affected by 
the variance request have been notified by certified mail.  The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall 
consider and decide all proposed variances taking into account the standards enumerated above.  
After the close of a public hearing and within ten (10) days the Board of Zoning Adjustment 
shall render a written decision, setting forth the reasons for such decision, which shall be 
accompanied by finding of fact(s) specifying the reason(s) for such decision.  All such decisions 
are final and binding on all parties. 
 
   
Section 1109.  Appeal of an Administrative Interpretation or Action.   
 
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected 
by any provision of this Ordinance or by any decision, or any order to stop, cease, and desist, 
issued by the Planning Director, Chief Building Official, or their designated representative,  in 
enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance.   
 
1109.01.  General Rules and Procedures for Appeals.   
 

A.  Any appeals from the rulings concerning the enforcement and interpretation of any 
provision of this Ordinance shall be filed with the Planning Director within 15 days after 
the date of said ruling.  All required fees shall be submitted along with a completed 
application and any additional information requested by the staff. 

 
B.  All appeals and applications made to the Board shall be in writing on forms 
prescribed by the Board and accompanied by fees prescribed by resolution of the City 
Council.

C.  All appeals and applications shall refer to the specific provisions of this Ordinance 
involved; and the grounds for the appeal.  

 
D.   The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal and give 
due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a written decision on the appeal without 
unreasonable delay.  The Board may affirm, reserve, wholly or in part, or modify the 
order, requirement, decision, or determination, as in its opinion it determines ought to be 
done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is 
taken.  The Planning & Inspections Department shall maintain complete records of all 
appeal actions of the Board.   

 
E.  Within ten (10) days after the close of a public hearing the Board shall render a 
written decision giving the reason(s) for its decision.   

 
F.  In rendering a decision with respect to an appeal from any order, decision, or 
determination the Board shall strictly interpret the language of the Ordinance and shall 
find that the city official was correct in his/her decision or in error.  Should be Board find 
that the interpretation, decision or actions was in error they must provide what is in their 
opinion the correct interpretation, decision or action.  However, the Board shall not 
render any decision which shall modify an order, decision, or determination which 
confers rights or privileges on the appellant that are not otherwise permissible under the 
strict interpretation of this language of this Ordinance.   

 
G.  Such decision shall be submitted to the appellant and the Planning Director.   

 
1109.02.  All decisions rendered by the Board shall be final and binding on all parties.  No 
request for a variance or appeal of an administrative decision shall be reheard, and no further 
application shall be accepted, once a decision has been given, except under one or more of the 
following conditions:   
 

A.  New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was 
not available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing. 

 
B.  The decision resulted from an error, made by the Board, the Planning Director, or any 
other City official, in procedures required by this Ordinance or State law. 

 
C.  The decision resulted from an error in substantive law under the provisions of this 
Ordinance or the Code of Alabama.   

 
Where no error is alleged and no new evidence is available a new or more effective presentation 
by the applicant shall not constitute grounds for rehearing a decision of the Board of Zoning 
Adjustment.  Any applicant wishing a rehearing shall appear before the Board to present one or 
more of the qualifying conditions listed in this Section.   
 
If the Board finds that one or more of these conditions exists, the applicant shall be permitted to 
submit a new application, together with the required fees.  The new application shall be heard at 



May 10, 2021 

XI-16 

a subsequent meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements.  
Allowing a new application does not obligate the Board to grant the request.   
 
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board may within 15 days after such decision 
appeal to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction. 
 
   
Section 1110.  Penalties.   
 
Any violation of any provision of this Ordinance, shall constitute a Class C misdemeanor.  
Violation of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of the requirements hereof shall be a
