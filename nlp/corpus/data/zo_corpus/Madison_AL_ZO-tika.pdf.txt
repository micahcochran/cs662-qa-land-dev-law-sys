under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the City of Madison, 
Alabama", together with the date of the adoption of this Ordinance. 
  
3-2-1 Changes in District Boundaries  
If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, changes are made in district boundaries or other 
matte portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map

No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map, or matter thereon, except in

 3-2-3 Final Authority to Zoning  
Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map, which may from time to time

be identified by the signature of the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk, under the following words:  
"This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted 
(date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison,

b) Boundaries Indicated as Approximately Following the Centerlines of Streets or Alleys shall 
be construed as following such centerlines as they exist on the ground, except where 
variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or 
parcel.  In the case of a street closure, the boundary shall be construed as remaining in its 
location except where ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center, in 
which case, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership. 

c) Boundaries Indicated as Approximately Following Lot Lines, Public Property Lines, and the 
like shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however, that where such 
boundaries are adjacent to a street or alley and the zoning status of the street or alley is not 
indicated, the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street or alley.  
In the event of street or alley closure, interpretation shall be as provided in Subsection 3-3-b 
above. 

d) Boundaries Indicated as Approximately Following City Limits shall be construed as following 
such city limits. 

e) Boundaries Indicated as Following Centerlines of Streams, Creeks, or Other Bodies of Water 
shall be construed as following such centerlines. 

f)   Boundaries Indicated as Following Physical Features Other Than Those Mentioned Above 
shall be construed as following such physical features, except where variation of actual 
location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel and in such 
case, the boundary shall be interpreted in such manner as to avoid changing the zoning 
status of any lot or parcel. 

g) Boundaries Indicated as Parallel to or Extensions of Features Indicated in Subsections 3-3-b 
through 3-3-e above shall be construed as being parallel to, or     extensions of, such feature. 

h) Distances not Specifically Indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the 
scale of the map. 

i)   Cases not Covered by Subsection 3-3-a through 3-3-h above. In cases not covered by 
Subsections 3-3-a through 3-3-h above, the Administrative Officer shall interpret the Official 
Zoning Map in accord with the intent and purpose of this Zoning Ordinance. Appeal from 
the interpretation of the Administrative Officer shall be only to the Board of Adjustment in 
conformity with Section 10-7 of this Zoning Ordinance. 

j)   Division of a Lot of Record by a District Boundary. Where a district boundary divides a lot of 
record which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this Ordinance, the Board of 
Adjustment may permit, as a Variance, the extension of the regulations for either portion of 
the lot for a distance not to exceed fifty (50) feet beyond the district line into the remaining 
portion of the lot. 

 

Section 3-4. Initial Zoning of Newly Annexed Land 
All newly annexed land or property which shall be brought into the corporate limits of the City of 
Madison, Alabama, shall by operation of this Section be initially zoned as AG (Agricultural District) and 
shall so remain zoned as AG (Agricultural District) until such time as said land or property is rezoned 
upon request of the landowner or landowners or pursuant to other sections of this Ordinance is further 
rezoned by appropriate action of the Board of Commissioners.

environment; 

3. Pedestrian Environment: Encourage pedestrian-oriented building forms and 
development patterns; Provide for a pedestrian-oriented environment on 
streets and sidewalks; Promote public safety through the provision of 
pedestrian-oriented street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, adequate 
visibility from adjacent buildings and primary pedestrian access from buildings 
to adjacent sidewalks; Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, include 
parks, plazas, greenways and public art; and Provide sufficient, safe and 
accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment; 

C. Description: The MU zoning district is not shown on the city’s zoning map except by application 
of a land owner and approval by city as a rezoning. The district permits a wide range of medical, 
office, retail, service, and other uses, including certain residential development types.  

D. Criteria for Rezoning to this District: In addition to criteria generally applicable for rezoning

4-8B-10 Amendments to the Approved Master Development Plan in the MU District 
 
A. Minor Amendments: The administrator may approve minor amendments to the Master 

development plan, which are in compliance with the provisions and intent of the MU zoning district, 
and which do not depart from the purposes of the MU zoning district. Minor amendments to the 
Master development plan are those determined by the administrator to not have any significant 
adverse effect on properties abutting the MU zoning district. Minor amendments to the Master 
development plan may be approved during the process of administratively approving land 
disturbance or development permitting. The administrator may require the applicant to provide 
written justification for the minor amendment if such justification is not evident within the permit 
application itself. 

B. Major Amendments: Should the administrator determine that a requested change to or deviation 
from the approved Master development plan would substantially depart from the stated purposes 
of the Mixed Use District, or would adversely affect properties abutting the MU zoning district; the 
proposed change or deviation will be classified as a major amendment and will be required to 
undergo review and receive approval of the city as an amendment to the MU zoning district.  

C. Land Use Conversions Authorized: Notwithstanding the above provisions, the applicant will be 
permitted, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to increase or decrease residential units or 
increase or decrease square footage of nonresidential building space; subject to the land use 
conversions in the following table (note: the conversions are designed such that a change in land use 
will not result in an increase in total vehicle trips according to traffic data for average trip generation 
rates, as specified in the Institute of Transportation Engineer’s Trip Generation). An increase in one 
category shall result in a decrease in another category in accordance with the conversion factors 
provided in the table below.  

D. No such amendment to the land uses and the development parameters shown on the approved 
Master development plan shall be administratively permitted if such increase or decrease would 
exceed 10 percent change of the number of approved housing units or 10 percent change in the 
square footage of nonresidential building space. Other conversions from hotel to other land uses, 
from hospital to other land uses, or any other uses, may be permitted if the applicant submits a 
study based on ITE Trip Generation, showing no net increase in the number of total average daily 
trips generated between the land uses substituted there for.

Section 4-12. Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) District Regulations  
 
4-12-1 Purpose of the TND District  
The TND District is a mixed-use, planned development district. In this district, land uses and 
development standards are enumerated but still provide the developer with substantial flexibility to 
create a unique, self-contained community. The purpose of a Traditional Neighborhood Development 
Zoning District (“TND District”) is to encourage mixed-use, compact development integrating a variety of 
land uses within close proximity of one another.  This district’s intent is to provide for the traditional 
development practices and flexible land use alternatives, rather than prohibiting conventional 
development, by allowing for:  

1. Human scale design options; 
2. A mixture of uses, including residential, commercial, civic, and open space uses in close 

proximity to one another within the neighborhood; 
3. A variety of housing types, residential densities, and sizes to accommodate households of all 

ages, sizes, and incomes; 
4. The incorporation of  a system of  interconnected streets, roads, drives, with sidewalks and 

walkways, that offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians,  for connections to existing and 
future developments; 

5. Building design and other improvements in an arrangement, bulk, form, character and 
landscaping that establishes a livable, harmonious and diverse environment; 

6. The incorporation  of environmental features into the design;  
7. The coordination of  transportation systems with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities 

for pedestrians and vehicles; 
8. Well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenways and parks 

woven into the pattern of the neighborhood; 
9. The incorporation of architecture, landscaping, lighting and signage standards integrated with 

the zoning provisions that contribute to the intended design character of the planned 
development. 

 
4-12-2 Applicability of Other Codes and Ordinances 
The Madison Code of Ordinances, Zoning Ordinance, and Subdivision Regulations (“Other Codes and 
Ordinances”) for the City apply to a TND District unless the ordinance authorizing TND zoning expressly 
provides otherwise.

Updated November 2, 2022 

65 

 

   

2. In addition to open space requirements, a TND District must have one Neighborhood Center 
Area, or meet the distance requirements to an existing Neighborhood Center Area as specified 
below and subject to approval by the City, and a Mixed Residential Area. A TND District may also 
have a Neighborhood Edge Area, and Civic Area.

landmarks and as organized elements for the neighborhood. Open space includes squares, 
plazas, greens, preservation, parks, and greenways.  

 
4-12-5 Uses in the TND District

residential areas in locations such as the corner of a local road and a collector that serves the 
neighborhood and should be limited to those uses and subject to those required conditions 
and general provisions identified in the B1 zoning district. 

2. Neighborhood Center Area shall consist of commercial, residential, civic or institutional, and open 
space uses as identified below.  All residents in the TND should be within approximately 1/2 mile or

(Ord. 00-05, 2/14/00) 
The purpose of this district is to maintain the rural, environmental, and scenic qualities of the City of 
Madison, Alabama, by preserving wetlands and other low-lying and significant open lands and hillsides 
while allowing landowners a reasonable return on their holdings. This district is intended to permit 
creative development alternatives that have the effect of leaving significant open areas adjacent to 
and/or within clustered housing developments. Minimum open space set asides are at least 20 percent 
of the gross plat area. 
 

A. Uses of Land in RC-1 
1) Permitted Uses – all uses permitted in the R-1 and R-1A zoning districts 
2) Special Exceptions – all Special Exceptions enumerated for the R-1A zoning district 

 
B. Dimensional Requirements in RC-1: The minimum lot size and all front, side, and rear yard 

setbacks may be reduced from the requirements for the R-1A district in proportion to the 
amount of the gross plat area set aside as protected open space. Example: A 40 percent set 
aside yields a 10,800 s.f. minimum lot size and a 24 ft. front yard setback. A 20 percent set aside 
yields a 14,400 s.f. minimum lot size and a 32 ft. front yard setback. In no event, however, shall 
dimensional requirements be reduced more than 40 percent from those specified for the R-1A 
district. Other dimensional requirements are as noted below:

The purpose of this district is to maintain the rural, environmental, and scenic qualities of the City of 
Madison, Alabama, by preserving wetlands and other low-lying and significant open lands and hillsides 
while allowing landowners a reasonable return on their holdings. This district is intended to permit 
creative development alternatives that have the effect of leaving significant open areas adjacent to 
and/or within clustered housing developments. Minimum open space set asides are at least 20 percent 
of the gross plat area. The difference between this district and the RC-1 district is that the RC-2 district 
allows for higher density and shorter setbacks than the RC-1 district.

Section 4-14. Water Supply Protection District  
The Water Supply Protection District is created for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, 
and welfare through the protection of public water supplies from the danger of water pollution.  
Regulations within the district are established to prevent water quality degradation due to pollutant 
loadings within aquifer recharge areas and with the watersheds of surface public water supplies. This 
district shall be in addition to and shall overlay all other zoning districts where it is applied, so that any 
parcel of land lying in such an overlay district shall lie in one or more other zoning districts provided for 
by the Zoning Ordinance. The effect is to create a new district that has the characteristics and limitations 
of the underlying district, together with the characteristics and limitations of the overlying district. 
Within the Water Supply Protection District, two areas shall be designated, to be known as “Area 1” and 
“Area 2.” Area 1 shall be the area where the most stringent protection of the water supply is necessary, 
and shall normally be in relatively close proximity to a wellhead. Area 2 shall encompass all other areas 
in the Water Supply Protection District. 
  
Regulations within such an overlay district are intended to provide a means for specific review and 
approval of residential, commercial, industrial and other development proposals that may have adverse 
water quality impacts; to encourage land uses and activities which will be compatible with water  quality 
protection; and to assure that structures and uses within such overlay districts will be developed in a 
manner that will serve the health, safety and welfare objectives of preserving the environmental 
integrity of public water supplies.

mitigation plan to ensure that no pollutants enter the groundwater table during construction. 
Additionally, the developer shall, in concert with the Water and Wastewater Board of the City of 
Madison, take steps to ensure that any such openings are protected from any future surface water 
infiltration. This may be accomplished by permanently closing such openings, or by taking other 
steps acceptable to the Board.

Section 4-15. Downtown Redevelopment Incentive (DRI) Overlay District 
 
A. Purpose: The Downtown Redevelopment Incentive (DRI) Overlay District affords additional 

development opportunity beyond that provided by the underlying zoning regulations. The DRI 
overlay is intended to encourage development by enabling mixed-use development, higher 
development density and intensity, and relief from other development restrictions in the Zoning 
Ordinance.  

 
B. Application and Effect: The DRI Overlay District is shown on Figure 1 below and includes all the 

properties inside the area highlighted in red. Properties in this district wishing to develop pursuant 
to the regulations for the DRI District must obtain approval of a Specific Development Permit by the 
Planning Commission. The development standards for the underlying districts remain in effect 
within the DRI Overlay District except as modified herein and by any development approval issued 
pursuant thereto. Any project proposing to meet the standards of the underlying district shall not be 
subject to the provisions of this ordinance unless the developer elects to come under this ordinance 
voluntarily.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

C. Modified Development Standards: 
Pursuant to Section 4-15 B the following standards may apply to development within the DRI in lieu 
of any requirements of the underlying zoning district: 
1. Alternate Off-Street Parking Requirements: Developments shall not be required to provide 

their own off-street parking, either on-site or off-site. Parking may be provided voluntarily at the 
option of the developer. 

2. Yards and Street Setbacks: 
a. Side and rear yards for all parking areas and for buildings adjacent to residential districts 

outside the DRI or adjacent to a public street shall be as required by the underlying district. 
b. Any portion of a building used for residential occupancy and having windows shall be at 

least five feet from both the side and rear property lines.

minimum lot size provisions of the underlying zoning district. The Planning Commission may set 
density, bulk, lot coverage, signage, open space, and landscaping requirements as part of a 
development review process for developments in the DRI District. 

4. Landscaping: All courts, yards, setbacks and parking areas shall be landscaped to the satisfaction 
of the Planning Commission as specified in the specific development plan.  Sidewalks normally 
are required, at the discretion of the Planning Commission. 

5. Uses and Mixed Uses: The Planning Commission may approve structures and uses not 
permitted by the underlying zoning district on a discretionary basis, based on the external 
impact and general compatibility of the project with the DRI. The Planning Commission may 
permit more than one principal use on a lot, such as upstairs apartments over storefront 
commercial or residential and office uses on the same lot or within the same structure (e.g., a 
doctor who works out of the home in which he/she resides). In permitting such uses and mixed 
uses, the Planning Commission may prescribe certain conditions including, but not limited to, 
hours of operation, limits on noise, etc. 

 
D. Procedure for Specific Development Plan Review

Section 5-3. Visibility at Intersections in Residential Districts  
On a corner lot in all residential zoning districts, no fence, wall, hedge, or other planting or structure that 
will obstruct vision between a height of two and one-half (2 1/2) and six (6) feet above the centerline 
grades of the intersecting streets shall be erected, placed, or maintained within the triangular area 
formed by the right-of-way lines at such corner lots and a straight line joining said right-of-way lines at 
points which are thirty (30) feet distant from the intersection of the right-of-way lines and measured 
along said right-of-way lines. 
 

Section 5-4. Lot Size  
No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record in single ownership, shall be 
reduced in size so that the lot width or depth, front, side or rear yards, lot area per dwelling unit or 
other requirements of this Ordinance are not maintained. This prohibition shall not be construed to 
prevent the purchase or condemnation of narrow strips of land for public utilities or street right-of-way 
purposes. 
 

Section 5-5. Yard Use Limitations  
No part of a yard or other open space required about any building or use for the purpose of complying 
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly 
required for another building or use. 
 

Section 5-6. One Principal Building on a Lot  
Every building hereafter erected, moved or structurally altered shall be located on a lot, and in no case 
shall there be more than one (1) principal building and its customary accessory buildings on the lot, 
except in the case of a specially designed complex of institutional, residential, commercial, or industrial 
buildings in an appropriate zoning district. 
 

Section 5-7. Access to a Public Street 
(Ord. 97-50) 
Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, or with access to 
an approved private street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and 
convenient access for servicing, fire protection, and required off-street parking. No dwelling shall be 
erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not abut on at least one public street or approved private 
street for at least twenty (20) feet. Special traffic lanes, designed to accommodate the deceleration of 
traffic into, and the acceleration of traffic out of the site, may be required by the City Engineer if, in his 
opinion, this would enhance traffic safety either within the site or on any road from which the site has 
access.  Such lanes may abut the development, and/or may be “center turn lanes,” as recommended by 
the City Engineer. The need for and design of such lanes will be based on generally recognized principals 
of traffic engineering. Said lanes may be constructed on public right-of-way or on the site,  at the 
discretion of the City Engineer. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to require the 
provision of acceleration and/or deceleration lanes when it is of the opinion that they are necessary for 
traffic safety, even if not recommended by the City Engineer.

5-15-2 Other Factors Determining Off-street Parking Requirements 
1. Fractional Spaces:  When determination of the number of spaces required by this Ordinance results 

in a requirement   of a fractional space, any fraction less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and 
any fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall require one (1) spaces. 

2. Enlarged/Changed Use:  From the effective date of this Ordinance, if such land, structures, or uses 
are enlarged, expanded, or changed, there shall be provided for the increment only of such land, 
structures, and uses enlarged, expanded or changed and maintained as herein required, at least the 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

116 

 

   

amount of off-street parking space that would be required hereunder if the increment were a 
separate land, structure, or use.  However, where a lot with an existing structure is cleared and a 
new structure is erected thereon, there shall be provided and maintained off-street parking space as 
required herein. 

3. Joint Use: When off-street parking space is used jointly by two or more uses with different 
requirements, or two or more uses having the same requirement, an area shall be provided equal to 
the total of requirements of all the uses. 

 
5-15-3  Off-street Parking Location 
The required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land they are 
intended to serve, provided, however, that for other than residential uses, the Board of Adjustment may 
allow the establishment of such off-street parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet of the 
premises they are intended to serve when (1) practical difficulties prevent the placing of the facilities on 
the same lot as the premises they are designed to serve; (2) the owner of the said parking area shall 
enter into a written agreement with the City with enforcement running to the City providing that the 
land comprising the parking area shall never be disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the 
building which the parking area serves so long as the facilities are required; and (3) the owner agrees to 
bear the expense of recording the agreement and agrees that the agreement shall bind his heirs, 
successors, and assigns. The written agreement shall be voided by the City if other off-street facilities 
are provided in accord with this Ordinance. 
 
5-15-4   Vision Clearance at Intersections 
Off-street parking shall observe the provisions of Section 5-3 of this Ordinance. 
 
5-15-5  Development and Maintenance of Off-street Parking Facilities 
1. Plans: An applicant for a building permit must submit plans showing the off-street parking required 

by this Ordinance. These plans must show location, arrangement, and dimensions of the off-street 
parking, turning spaces, drives, aisles, and ingress and egress in a manner satisfactory for the safety 
and convenience of pedestrian, as well as vehicular, traffic. 

2. Size: Each space shall have an area not less than 180 square feet, nor have a minimum width less 
than nine feet. (Ord. 2019-142)

parking or service facility, adequate space shall be provided such that all truck maneuvering is 
performed off the street. 

g. Off-street vehicle stacking areas. Adequate stacking capacity shall be required for both inbound 
and outbound vehicles to facilitate the safe and efficient movement between the street and the 
parking facility. An inbound reservoir shall be of sufficient size to ensure that vehicles will not 
obstruct the adjacent street, sidewalk and circulation within the facility. An outbound reservoir 
shall be required to eliminate backup and delay of vehicles within the facility.  

h. Special considerations and exceptions. In the case of special driveway needs such as service 
stations, drive-in banks or other high-volume traffic uses, or where property is of a nature that 
the requirements of this Code cannot be met, an applicant may submit a traffic engineering 
study requesting technical deviation from these requirements. The traffic engineering study 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison

shall be performed and certified by a registered professional engineer qualified in traffic 
engineering. The study will set forth all traffic operations and safety features and minimizes the 
impact of the special driveway or technical deviation. Based upon the study, and upon the 
recommendation of the City Engineer, driveways may be approved by the Planning Commission 
where necessary and in such a manner as to minimize the impact on the adjacent street. 

i. Administration.  

i.  All applications for driveway and median cut permits shall be made to the Community 
Development Department, which shall bring the permit application to the Planning 
Commission along with a recommendation thereon at the Commission’s next scheduled 
meeting. Only the Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant any permit 
required by this section. The City shall collect a permit fee of $50.00 to process the 
application. 

ii.  The approval of a site plan certificate, site plan amendment, or other development order by 
the Planning Commission clearly depicting a proposed driveway shall serve as the required 
permit for any driveway so depicted, and no separate permit fee will be collected. Provided 
that, median cuts shall require the explicit approval of the Planning Commission by 
affirmative vote and a separate permit fee will be collected.  

j. Application to existing driveways and off-street parking facilities: 

i. Any driveway or off-street parking facility existing on the effective date of this ordinance, 
and which by the terms of this section has become a nonconforming driveway or off-street 
parking facility is hereby declared not to be in violation of this section, subject to the 
conditions following herein.   

ii. In the event of an expansion of an existing use for which a nonconforming driveway and off-
street parking facility has been constructed, the provisions of this section shall apply; and 
the expanded use shall make necessary compliance with the terms and conditions of this 
section.  

iii. If an existing driveway or off-street parking facility can be brought into conformance with 
the requirements of this section by minor alterations to the site, then, if a change on the site 
is made which necessitates the issuance of a building permit, the adjustments and 
alterations shall be made on the site to conform with the provisions of this section. 

2. Improvement. 

a. Surfacing, Marking, and Drainage: All off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance and 
intended for use by the public or by employees, and their access roads within the parking area and 
leading from the street to said area, shall be paved with an all-weather surface of asphaltic 
concrete, portland cement concrete or any equivalent material acceptable to the Administrative 
Officer, and maintained such that no dust will result from continued use. Spaces intended primarily 
for the parking or storage of heavy equipment, trucks (excluding pickup trucks), or other vehicles 
not classified as passenger cars by the National Highway Transportation Safety Board need not be 
paved; however, areas intended primarily for parking of such vehicles shall be spread with gravel of 
a size, weight and thickness acceptable to the City Engineer. All Spaces shall be arranged and 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

122 

 

   

marked so as to provide for orderly and safe parking. Drainage shall be provided to dispose of all 
surface water without crossing sidewalks. 
 

b. Barriers/Bumpers: Except for parking areas provided for single-family and two-family units, suitable 
barriers or curbs shall be provided to protect sidewalks. Wheel or bumper guards shall be located so 
that no part of any vehicle shall extend beyond the parking area, intrude on pedestrian ways, or 
come in contact with walls, fences or plantings. As an alternative to requiring wheel stops, the 
Planning Commission may permit the widening of walks and landscaped areas to a minimum of six 
feet, where such widening will serve to protect walls, fences and landscaping in a substantially 
similar manner as wheel stops. Any increase in open space made necessary by the substitution of 
open space in lieu of wheel stops shall not be counted as open space in the calculation thereof for 
the project site, nor shall said areas be counted toward the minimum open space requirements for 
the zoning district in which the development is located. Areas of open space substituted for required 
wheel stops shall be identified on the site plan, and their cumulative area computed and noted on 
the site plan.  
 

c. Lighting: Lighting for off-street parking shall be adequate and so arranged as to direct the light away 
from any adjoining property in a residential district. Lighting shall conform with Section 5-22 of this 
Ordinance. 
 

d. Special rules for vehicle sales lots: All lots used to store and display vehicles for sale, including but 
not limited to new and used cars, trucks, recreational vehicles, trailers, campers, boats, motor 
homes, shall be improved in accordance with Section 5-15-(4) of this ordinance. All such lots shall 
also be required to provide perimeter landscaping in accordance with Section 5-15-6 (5) (Perimeter 
Landscaping) of this ordinance. 
 

e. Special Rules for Porous Pavement (Ord. 2002-153): As an alternative to conventional bituminous 
asphalt paving, off-street-parking areas may be paved with GEOBLOCK® “Porous Pavement” or its 
equivalent, as approved by the City Engineer. Application and installation of porous pavement shall 
be in accordance with manufacturer’s directions and shall conform to USEPA Circular EPA 832-F-99-
023, Stormwater Technology Fact Sheet: Porous Pavement, which is available from the City 
Engineer’s Office.

2. Size:  Each space shall have  clear  horizontal dimensions of twelve (12) feet by thirty (30) feet 
exclusive of platforms and piers and a clear vertical dimension of fourteen (14) feet. 

 

Section 5-17. Airport Influence Area 
All land lying within the NEF 30 or higher noise contour as designated on the Official Zoning Map, City of 
Madison, is subject to special development regulations for the purpose of protection of the general 
health, safety and welfare of the public. In the case of any noise sensitive land uses within the NEF 30 or 
greater corridor, the potential buyer or builder shall be advised of the special requirements for 
development within this area as outlined in the Madison Subdivision Regulations. 
 

Section 5-18. Required Buffers  
(Ord. 96-02) 
The use of properly planted and maintained buffer areas may reduce and ease potential incompatibility 
between or among different uses of land in proximity to each other. 
 
5-18-1 Requirements  
Landscaped buffers are required wherever two different zoning districts are adjacent to one another. 
The width of these buffers depends on the nature of the adjacency; that is, which two districts are 
adjacent to one another. The width requirements are enumerated in Section 5-18-5 below. In addition, 
buffers must meet the following requirements: 

1. The landscaped buffer area shall not be less than the width specified in the Sec. 5-18-5 
measured at right angles to property lines and shall  be established  along the entire length 
of and contiguous to the designated property line or lines. 

2. The area shall be so designed, planted, and maintained as to be eighty (80) percent or 
more opaque between two (2) and six (6) feet above average ground level when viewed 
horizontally,  unless otherwise specified in the appropriate district regulations. 

3. Types and numbers of plantings for landscaped buffers shall be submitted with application 
for a building permit, along with plans and statements demonstrating how the buffer will 
be irrigated in the future. No building permit or site plan certificate shall be issued without 
such data, where this Ordinance requires a landscaped buffer area or areas. 

4. Plantings shall be of a size and type which will insure the meeting of the eighty (80) percent 
opacity requirement within no longer than twelve (12) months of the date of first planting.  
Where questions may arise as to the suitability of proposed plant materials to meet this 
requirement, final determination of suitability shall be made by the Planning Commission. 
Eighty-percent opacity must be maintained year-round. 

5. Failure to maintain the landscaped buffer area as set out above shall be a violation of this 
Ordinance. 

 
5-18-2  Substitution for Landscaped Buffer Area 
When expressly authorized by the Planning Commission, a six (6) foot high opaque structure set in a five 
(5) foot wide landscaped buffer area may be substituted for the six (6) foot high, planted buffer in 
Subsection 5-18-1. 
 
5-18-3  Exception to Requirement  
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to require a landscaped buffer adjacent to a road depicted 
on the City’s Major Road Plan. In addition, the Planning Commission may, by majority vote, waive any 
buffering requirement with respect to lot lines adjacent to any public street. (ord. 98-02)

5-18-4 Zoning Determines Buffer 
Landscaped buffers shall be constructed by, and located on the lot zoned for the more intensive use. 
The Table in Section 5-18-5 below shall be used to determine which use is more intensive, with the least 
intensive uses on the left side of the horizontal axis of the Table, and the most intensive uses on the 
right side of the horizontal axis. In the case where an existing "more intensive" use adjoins a lower 
intensity district, but has not provided the required landscaped buffer, the less intensive use, when 
developed, may provide the buffer, at the option of the less intensive use. 
 
5-18-5 Minimum Landscape Buffer Widths  
Minimum landscape buffer Widths shall be established according to the following table. Where district 
regulations in Chapter 4 of this Ordinance require a different buffer width, the requirements in Chapter 
4 will control. All required buffers are in addition to yard requirements:

Section 5-18A. Sidewalks  
(Ord. 97-50) 
 
5-18A-1 Sidewalks Required 
At the time of site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall require the construction of 5 ft. wide 
concrete sidewalks along the adjacent public City street frontage for any project subject to the 
provisions of Section 5-2 of the zoning ordinance, unless a sidewalk exists at the time the site plan is 
approved. In the event that the project fronts on two streets depicted on the adopted Future 
Transportation Network Map in the Comprehensive Plan, sidewalks shall be provided on both streets. In 
the event that the project fronts on two streets, only one of which is depicted on the adopted Future 
Transportation Network Plan in the Comprehensive Plan, sidewalks shall be provided on the street so 
depicted, and, should the Planning Commission so require, also on the other street. Sidewalks shall be 
installed on public right-of-way. However, the Planning Commission shall in no case require the 
installation of sidewalks on State-owned right-of-way or along State Roads. When right-of-way is not 
available, the Planning Commission may require the installation of sidewalks in a sidewalk easement in 
the front yard on the site, in such location and configuration as to connect to existing or future 
sidewalks on adjacent parcels. However, sidewalks may not be installed in a front yard without the 
explicit approval of the Planning Commission.  
 
5-18A-2  Waiver by Planning Commission 

1. When the installation of sidewalks is, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, impractical, 
unjustifiable, or otherwise not in the public interest, the Planning Commission shall have the 
authority to waive this requirement. 

2. Sidewalks shall not be required adjacent to parcels which are zoned M-1 or M-2. (ord. 98-74) 
 
5-18A-3 Sidewalks in Buffer Areas 
Where the Planning Commission permits sidewalks or other walkways designed for pedestrian traffic to 
be placed within buffer areas required by Section 5-18 or any zoning district regulations, the width of 
the buffer will be increased 1 ft. for every foot of width of the sidewalk.

Section 5-19. Storm Water Management, Drainage, Erosion Control  
To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural 
and pre-existing man-made drainage ways shall remain undisturbed. Lot boundaries shall be made to 
coincide with natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the 
creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainage ways and topography. 
 
5-19-1 Storm Water Management 
All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably 
burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments. Specific requirements area: 
 

1. No developments may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably 
impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development, 
thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and 

 
2. No development may be constructed or maintained so that surface waters from such 

development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent properties at such 
locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower adjacent properties. 

       
5-19-2 Drainage 
A.  All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue 
retention of surface water on the development site. Surface waters shall not be regarded as unduly 
retained if: 
 

1. The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately installed as part of an 
approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or 

2. The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the 
development site in its predevelopment stage, unless such retention presents a danger to health 
or safety. 

 
B.  No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer system. 
 
C.  Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to 
the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets. 
 
D.  Use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter storm sewers in subdivisions is provided for in 
Subdivision Regulations of the City of Madison, Alabama. Private roads and access ways within 
unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter storm drains to provide adequate drainage if 
the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other 
sufficient reasons exist to require such construction. 
 
E.  Construction specifications for drainage swales, curbs and gutters, and storm drains shall be 
contained in the Subdivision Regulations. 
 
F. The City Engineer may require the detention or retention of stormwater on-site if necessary to meet 
Stormwater Management level of service standards adopted by the City. However, if capacity is 
available in the downstream drainage channels, the City Engineer may permit the drainage of the site 
into the existing system. In the event the site is drained into the existing system, the City Engineer may 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

136 

 

   

require the upgrading of downstream drainage improvements if necessary to maintain their 
predevelopment level of service. Attention is called to the Stormwater Management and Drainage 
standards and criteria found in the Public Improvements Manual. 
 
5-19-3 Erosion and Sedimentation Control 
 
A.  No zoning, special-use, or conditional-use permit may be issued and final approval for subdivision 
plats or certified plats may not be given with respect to any development that would cause land 
disturbing activity unless the professional engineer officially representing the developer certifies to the 
City that all necessary permits have been received from those agencies from which approval is required 
by state or federal law and that either: 
 

1. An erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the City Engineer; or 
2. The City Engineer has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it reasonably 

appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer of 
more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case, construction of the 
development may not begin, and no building permits may be issued, until the City Engineer 
approves the erosion control plan. 

 
B.  For the purposes of this section, land disturbing activity means any use of the land by any person in 
residential, educational, institutional,  commercial,  or  industrial  
development, and highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the 
natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation.  Sedimentation occurs 
whenever solid mineral or organic particulate matter is transported by water, ice, air, or gravity from the 
site of its origin.

Section 5-22. Outdoor Lighting Control  
(99-108, 8-23-99) (Ord. 2001-20) 
 
5-22-1 Findings  
The purpose of this article is to create standards for outdoor lighting to increase compatibility of 
different land uses by minimizing light pollution, glare, and light trespass caused by inappropriate or 
misaligned light fixtures, while improving nighttime public safety, utility, and security, and preserving 
the rural, environmental, and scenic qualities of the City of Madison.

Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the following terms and phrases, as used in this 
article, shall have the meanings designated in this section: 

a. "Zoning Administrator" shall mean the Zoning Administrator of the City of Madison or 
his/her representative. 

b. "Fully Shielded" shall mean a technique or method of construction and/or manufacture 
which does not allow any light dispersion to shine above the horizontal plane from the 
lowest light emitting point of the light fixture. In addition, the light emitting, distributing, 
reflecting and refracting components of the light fixture, i.e. lamp, lens, reflective surface, 
etc., shall not extend beyond the shielding of the fixture. Any structural part of the light 
fixture providing this shielding shall be permanently affixed to the light fixture. 

c. "Glare" shall mean artificial light that causes annoyance, discomfort, or loss of visual 
performance and visibility. 

d. "Installed" shall mean the initial installation of outdoor light fixtures defined herein, 
following the effective date of this article. A project with an approved building permit 
prior to the effective date of this ordinance is excluded from compliance with the article 
for the initial installation only. 

e. "Light pollution" shall mean any artificial light that causes a detrimental effect on the 
environment, and/or enjoyment of the night sky or causes undesirable glare or light 
trespass. 

f. "Light trespass" shall mean artificial light that produces an unnecessary and unwanted 
illumination of an adjacent property. 

g. "Luminous tube lighting" shall mean gas-filled tubing which, when subjected to high 
voltage, becomes luminescent in a color characteristic of the particular gas used, e.g. 
neon, argon, etc. 

h. "Outdoor light fixtures" shall mean outdoor electrically powered illuminating devices, 
outdoor light or reflective or refractive surfaces, lamps and similar devices including all 
parts used to distribute the light and/or protect the lamp, permanently installed or 
portable, used for flood lighting, general illumination or advertisement. Such devices shall 
include, but are not limited to, search, spot, and flood lights for: 

1. buildings and structures, including canopies and overhangs; 
2. recreation facilities; 
3. bike paths, greenbelts and parks; 
4. parking lot lighting; 
5. landscape lighting; 
6. billboards and other signs (advertising and other); 
7. street lighting, 
8. display and service areas; and

9. walkway lighting 
i. "Outdoor recreation facility" shall mean an area designed for active recreation, whether 

publicly or privately owned, including, but not limited to, baseball and softball diamonds, 
soccer and football fields, golf courses, tennis courts and swimming pools. 

j. "Uplighting" shall mean any artificial light source that distributes light above an imaginary 
horizontal plane passing through the lowest light emitting point of the light fixture. 

 
5-22-3 General Requirements 
 

a. All outdoor light fixtures installed after the effective date of this article and thereafter 
maintained upon property used for commercial, industrial, multi-family purposes or 
governmental purposes (excluding rights-of-way), as defined in the Zoning Code of the 
City of Madison, shall be fully shielded. In addition, light trespass and glare on, from, or 
onto any property shall be limited to a reasonable level through the use of shielding and 
directional lighting methods, including, but not limited to, fixture location and height. 

b. Externally illuminated signs, advertising displays, billboards, and building identification 
shall use top mounted light fixtures which shine light downward and which are fully 
shielded. 

c. The use of mercury vapor fixtures or lamps for outdoor lighting is prohibited. 
d. Outdoor light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues, or any other objects mounted on a 

pole, pedestal, or platform shall use a very narrow cone of light for the purpose of 
confining the light to the object of interest and minimize spill-light and glare. 

e. Outdoor light fixtures used for outdoor recreational facilities shall be fully shielded except 
when such shielding would cause an impairment to the visibility required in the intended 
recreational activity. In such cases, partially shielded fixtures and directional lighting 
methods shall be utilized to limit light pollution, glare and light trespass to a reasonable 
level, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, without diminishing the performance 
standards of the intended recreational activity. Illumination from recreational facility light 
fixtures shall be shielded to minimize glare extending toward roadways where 
impairment of motorist vision might cause a hazard. 

f. In addition to the provisions in this article, all outdoor light fixtures shall be installed in 
conformity with all other applicable provisions of this municipal code. 

 
5-22-4 Exemptions 
 

a. All outdoor light fixtures existing and legally installed prior to the effective date of this 
article are exempt from the provisions of this article, provided, however, that no 
replacement, structural alteration, or restoration of outdoor light fixtures shall be made 
unless it thereafter conforms to the provisions of this article. However, exemptions may 
be granted to this conformance standard if: 

1. Utilization of conforming outdoor light fixtures would have the effect of 
decreasing the lighting levels to below the minimum illumination levels required 
by the city, and the additional cost necessary to meet the minimum illumination 
levels would exceed 50% of the original installed cost of the light fixture; and/or 

2. Utilization of conforming outdoor light fixtures would negatively impact the 
aesthetic quality/architectural design of the property or immediate area by 
mixing substantially different styles and types of fixtures/poles.

kerosene lanterns or gas lamps, are exempt from the requirements of this article. 

c. Temporary lights used for holiday decorations are exempt from the requirements of this 
article. 

d. Construction or emergency lighting is exempt, provided such lighting is temporary and is 
discontinued immediately upon completion of the construction work or abatement of the 
emergency necessitating said lighting. 

e. Signs of the type constructed of translucent materials and wholly illuminated from within 
are exempt from the shielding requirement. 

 
5-22-5 Approved Materials and Methods of Installation: 

a. The provisions of this article are not intended to prevent the use of any design, material 
or method of installation not specifically proscribed by this article provided any such 
alternate has been approved by the city. The Zoning Administrator may approve any such 
alternate provided that the proposed design, material or method: 

1. Provides approximate equivalence to the specific requirements of this article; or

Article VII – Sign Control Regulations 
 

Section 7-1. Purpose 
The purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and further 
the goals of Madison’s Growth Plan. There is a legitimate call for regulation of signs because signs can 
obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems. This 
article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech 
and enable the public to:  
7-1-1    Enhance the economy of the City in accordance with its plans and ordinances by promoting the 

reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs; 
7-1-2 Locate businesses and facilities that offer goods and services without difficulty or confusion;  
7-1-3 Protect and enhance property values;  
7-1-4 Facilitate the creation of a convenient, orderly, attractive, and harmonious community;  
7-1-5 Promote traffic and pedestrian safety by preventing obstructions within public rights-of-way, 

minimizing visual distractions to motorists, ensuring that sign size and height is appropriate for a 
sign’s location, and preventing conflicts with public safety signs and police and fire protection;  

7-1-6 Protect the safety of people and property from sign hazards due to collapse, decay, or 
abandonment; 

7-1-7 Balance the rights of individuals to convey messages through signs with the right of the public to 
be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 

7-1-8 Restrict signs and lights that obstruct or interfere with drivers’ vision and therefore contribute 
to the probability of traffic accidents and hazards; 

7-1-9 Promote signs that are compatible with their surroundings, that are appropriate to the planned 
character and development of each zoning district, and which do not obstruct light, air, and 
open space; 

7-1-10 Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and 
7-1-11 Regulate the proper construction, maintenance, safety, and structural soundness, as well as the 

appearance and attractiveness of signs.

If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding 
shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article that can be given effect without the invalid 
provision.   
 

Section 7-3. Applicability  
 
7-3-1 It shall hereafter be unlawful for any person to erect, place, relocate, expand, modify, maintain,

7-5-2 Sign Height 

a. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal 
grade (average grade at the base of the sign) to the top of the highest attached component 
of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after 
construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely undertaken 
for the purpose of locating or increasing the height of sign.  



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

151 

 

   

b. In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign height shall be 
computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign 
is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public or private street. 
 

7-5-3 Sign Width 
a. The width of a sign shall be measured across the widest portion of a sign that runs parallel 

to the ground at the base of the sign. 
b. The sign width shall include all structure elements of a sign (e.g., support posts, sign cabinet, 

etc.). 
 
7-5-4 Sign Area 

The surface of a sign to be included when computing maximum allowable square footage of sign 
area shall be calculated as follows: 
a. When calculating street frontage, only the street frontage that lies in the incorporated area 

of the City of Madison shall be used in the calculation. 
b. All fractions will be rounded to the closest integer number. 
c. For sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel, cabinet, or surface distinctively 

painted, textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as the background for the sign copy, the 
sign area shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or 
combination thereof that encompasses the extreme limits of the background panel, cabinet, 
or surface. See Figure A and Figure B. 

d. For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted or painted on a building 
façade where there is no background panel, cabinet, or surface distinctively painted, 
textured, lighted, or constructed to serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area 
shall be computed by means of the combination of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, 
triangle, or combination thereof that encloses all the letters or elements associated with the 
sign. See Figure C. In cases where there are multiple sign elements on the same surface, the 
Planning Director shall have the authority to determine the outermost boundaries of 
individual sign elements. 

e. The calculation of sign area shall not include any supporting framework, bracing, or 
decorative fence or wall unless such structural support is determined to constitute an 
integral part of the sign design by means of text or other commercial message, as 
determined by the Planning Director. See Figure A.

f. In the case of a three-dimensional sign where the sign faces are not mounted back-to-back, 
the sign area shall be calculated by the smallest square, rectangle or circle that encompasses 
the profile of the sign message.  The profile used shall be the largest area of the sign 
message visible from any one point. See Figure D. 

 
Figure D: The sign area of a three-dimensional sign is measured measuring the smallest square, 

rectangle, or circle that encompasses the profile of the sign (illustrated as sides). 
 

g. Except for three-dimensional signs, the sign area for a sign with more than one face (multi-
faced signs) shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces when the 
interior angle is greater than 60 degrees.  

h. When two identical, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back or at angles of 60 degrees or 
less, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and when 
such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches apart, 
the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the two faces 
are unequal, the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces.  

i. The calculation of the width or lineal measurement of any façade shall be the measurement 
of the façade between two side facades. The calculation shall be based on viewing the 
façade from a 90-degree angle (i.e., straight on), regardless of façade insets, offsets, or 
angles. See        Figure E.

Article VIII – Non-Conformities 
 

Section 8-1. Purpose 
Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted there may 
exist (a) lots, (b) structures, (c) uses of land and structures, which were lawful before this Ordinance was 
adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this 
Ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to 
continue until they are voluntarily removed, or removed as required by this Ordinance, but not to 
encourage their continuance. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that non-conformities shall not be 
enlarged upon, expanded, intensified, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures 
or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
 
8-1-1 Incompatibility with Permitted Uses: Non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be 
incompatible with Permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-
conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be 
extended or enlarged after the effective date of this Ordinance or its amendment by attachment on 
structures or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition 
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
 
8-1-2 Construction of Non-Conforming Use: To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be 
deemed to require a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual 
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance 
and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby 
defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a 
permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been 
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation, demolition,  or removal shall be deemed 
to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently until the completion of the 
new construction involved. 
 

Section 8-2. Non-Conforming Lots of Record 
In any district in which single-family dwellings  are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary 
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or 
amendment of this Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this 
Ordinance.  Said lot must be in separate ownership and not in continuous frontage with other lots in the 
same ownership.  This provision shall apply even though a lot fails to meet the requirements for area or 
width, or both that are applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions (front, rear and side) 
and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both of the lot shall conform to the 
regulations for the district in which such lot is located.  Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained 
only through action of the Board of Adjustment (Article X, Section 10-9) 
 
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single 
ownership are of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or 
part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and for area, the lands involved 
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance and no portion of said 
parcel shall be used in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements

8-3-4 Cessation of Non-Conforming Uses of Land: (or land with minor structures only) in certain 
districts. In implementing the intent of Section 8-3, the non-conforming use of land or use of land with

shall be discontinued not later than three (3) years from the effective date of this Ordinance. 
 

Section 8-4. Non-Conforming Structures  
Where a structure exists lawfully under this Ordinance at the effective date of its adoption or 
amendment that could not be built under this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, residential 
densities, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or requirements other than use concerning the 
structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the 
following provisions: 
 
8-4-1 Enlargement: No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way which 
increases its  non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its non-
conformity.

of a non-conforming  use provided there is no change in the nature or character of such non-conforming 
use.

combination, ceases for any reason (except where governmental action impedes access to the premises) 
for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, any subsequent use shall conform to the 
regulations for the district in which the use is located.

one (5l) percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. Upon removal or destruction as set 
out in this Subsection, the use of land and structures shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the 
district in which such land is located. 
 

Section 8-6. Non-Conforming Structures Unsafe Because of a Lack of Maintenance

becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by the 
Administrative Officer to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be 
restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is

(Municipal  Building Inspector). This official shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any 
reasonable time prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the purpose of making 
inspections of buildings or premises necessary in carrying out his duties in the enforcement of this 
Ordinance. 
 
If the Administrative Officer shall find that any of the provisions of this Ordinance are being violated, he 
shall take any action authorized to insure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions. 
 

Section 9-2. Building Permits Required 
It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation for the construction of any building or other structure, 
including accessory structures or to store building materials or erect temporary field offices, or to 
commence the moving, alteration, or repair (except repairs not changing the character of the structure 
and not involving Southern Standard Building Code inspection) of any structure without a building 
permit issued by the Administrative Officer. Applications for a building permit shall be made to the 
Administrative Officer on forms provided for that purpose and shall be accompanied by a fee according 
to a fee schedule currently in use by the City, and a site plan in conformance with Section 9-3 of this 
Ordinance. 
 

Section 9-3. Approval of Plans and Issuance of Building Permit 
It shall be unlawful for the Administrative Officer to approve any plans or issue a building permit for any 
excavation or construction until he has inspected such plans in detail and found them in conformity with 
this Ordinance. To this end, the Administrative Officer shall require that every application for a building 
permit for excavation, construction, use of land, moving, or alteration be accompanied by a plan or plat 
drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the Administrative Officer to 
ascertain whether or not the proposed excavation, construction, use of land, moving  or alteration is in 
conformance with this Ordinance: 
 
1. The actual shape, proportion, and dimensions of the lot to be built upon; 
2. The shape, size, and locations of all buildings or other structures to be erected, altered, or moved, 

and of any buildings or other structures already on the lot; 
3. The existing and intended use of all such buildings or other structures; 
4. The location and number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces; 
5. The proposed number of dwelling units; occupants, employees, or other similar uses; 
6. The setbacks, side yards, open spaces, required buffers, signs and other requirements of the 

applicable zoning district; 
7. Any other information deemed necessary by the Administrative Officer to determine and provide for 

the enforcement of this Ordinance. 
 
If the proposed excavation, construction,  moving  or alteration as set forth in the application is in 
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, the Administrative Officer shall issue a building permit 
accordingly. If an application for a building permit is not approved, the Administrative Officer shall state 
in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval. Issuance of a building permit shall, in no

case, be construed as waiving any provision of this Ordinance, unless otherwise waived according to 
Article X, Section 10-9. 
 

Section 9-4. Inspection 
The construction or usage affected by any building permit shall be subject to four inspections:  the first, 
when the foundation has been excavated; the second, when the foundation has been completed and 
the building lines have been established; the third, when all electrical and mechanical elements are in 
place; and the fourth, when the building or structure has been completed. 
 
 It shall be the duty of the holder of the permit to properly notify the Administrative Officer as to the 
time when the construction will be ready for inspection.  Failure to make proper notification of the time 
for such inspection shall automatically cancel the permit, requiring the issuance of a new permit before 
construction may proceed or occupancy may be permitted. The proper location of buildings and the 
verification of setback lines are the responsibility of the owner and not the Administrative Officer.  
Improper location of buildings is a violation of this Ordinance and may result in the revocation of the 
Building Permit and/or the Certificate of Occupancy. 
 

Section 9-5. Certificate of Occupancy 
 
9-5-1:   No land or building or other structure or part thereof hereafter erected, moved, or altered in its 
use shall be used or occupied until the Administrative Officer shall have issued a Certificate of 
Occupancy stating that such land or structure, or part thereof, is found to be in conformity with the 
provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
9-5-2  Temporary  Certificate  of  Occupancy:  When  the Administrative Officer shall determine that 
some detail of this Ordinance has not been complied with, the Administrative Officer shall have the 
discretionary authority to issue a temporary, time-limited  Certificate  of  Occupancy.  Such  Temporary 
Certificate of Occupancy may be issued if all of the following conditions are met: 
 

1. Some special situation exists where, in the opinion of the Administrative Officer, it is not in 
the public interest  to require strict compliance with  this Ordinance. 

 
2. A building inspector shall perform a final inspection of the structure, and shall certify that 

there are no violations of the adopted Building, Gas, Mechanical, Plumbing, Electrical or Fire 
Safety Codes that might render the structure unsafe in any way.  

 
3. A Subcontractors List has been submitted to and approved by the Inspection Division in the 

Department of Community Development, according to the Division's rules for the approval 
thereof. 

 
4. The Certificate is limited to a certain period of time not to exceed 180 days, but not longer 

than the special situation that gives rise to the need for a Temporary     Certificate of 
Occupancy shall continue (e.g., special event). Such Temporary Certificate of Occupancy 
shall not be renewed beyond 180 days. 

 
5. All required fees have been paid to the City in connection with the structure.

6. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy may be issued only to single family homes with 
temporary uses other than "single family dwelling". In all cases, the temporary permitted  
use shall be shown on  the  Temporary Certificate of Occupancy, and the Certificate shall be 
valid only for that use. 

 
9-5-3  Issuance  of Temporary Certificates  of  Occupancy: Issuance of a Temporary Certificate of 
Occupancy shall be within the discretion of the Administrative Officer, with all decisions on the Issuance 
or denial of such Certificates reviewable by the Director of Community Development and the Mayor. 
Appeal of the administrative  decision shall be to the Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals. A 
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be canceled with twenty four (24) hours’ notice to the 
property owner if the Administrative Officer shall determine that one or more of the conditions in 
subsection 9-5-2 is no longer being met. (Ord. 90-14) 
 
9-5-4: Within three (3) days after the owner, or his agent, has notified the Administrative Officer that a 
building or premises, or part thereof, is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the 
Administrative Officer to make a final inspection thereof, and to issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the 
building and premises are found to conform with  the provisions of this Ordinance; or, if such certificate 
is refused, to state the refusal in writing with the cause.

Section 10-2. Procedures of Zoning Board of Adjustment  
 
10-2-1 Decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals 

1. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Adjustment shall reverse or affirm, 
wholly or in part, shall modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be 
made, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Ordinance, and to that end, 
shall have the powers of the Administrative Officer from whom the appeal is taken. 

2. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, 
requirement, decision, or determination of the Administrative Officer; to decide in favor of the 
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance; or to effect any 
variation in the application of this Ordinance.  

3. All decisions rendered by the Board of Adjustments shall be final and binding on all parties. No 
request for an appeal, special exception or variance shall be heard, and no further application 
shall be accepted, once a decision has been given, except under one or more of the following

a. New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was 

not available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing.

Board of Adjustment.  

 

4. Any applicant requesting a rehearing shall appear before the Board of Adjustment to present 
one or more of the qualifying conditions listed in 10-2-1 above. If the Board of Adjustment finds 
that one or more of these conditions exists, the applicant shall be permitted to submit a new 
application, together with the required fees. The new application shall be heard at a subsequent 
meeting and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements. Allowing 
application does not obligate the Board of Adjustment to grant the request.  

10-2-2 Appeals from Decisions by the Board of Adjustment 
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal to the appropriate Circuit 
Court within fifteen (15) days of the entry of the decision.

183 

 

   

filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause 
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a 
restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on 
application, on notice to the Administrative Officer, and on due cause shown.  
 

Section 10-3. Appeals from the Decision of the Administrative Officer 
Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustment concerning interpretation or administration of this 
Ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected by any decision, or any order to stop, 
cease, and desist, issued by any administrative officer in enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance.  

1. Any application for appeal from the ruling of any administrative decisions concerning the

the Board.  

6. In rendering a decision with respect to an appeal from any order, decision, or determination, the 
Board shall strictly interpret the language of the Ordinance and shall not render any decision 
which shall modify an order, decision, or determination which confers rights or privileges on the 
appellant that are not otherwise permissible under the strict interpretation of this language of 
this Ordinance.  

Section 10-4. Special Exceptions  
Special Exceptions are those uses that may have some special impact which differs from the potential 
impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have a uniqueness such that their effect on 
the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a 
particular location. 
  
Upon submission of a request for special exception approval, a review of the location, proposed or 
existing design, configuration, and impact shall be conducted by the Planning Department to determine 
whether the proposed use would have a detrimental impact on neighboring properties and/or how 
those impacts may best be mitigated through specific requirements the Board of Adjustment may 
impose. 
 
The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; 
planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by the proposed 
use; whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is consistent 
with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance and any other development plans, policies and/or regulations of 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

184 

 

   

the City of Madison; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the 
developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the 
public health, safety, and welfare in general. 
 
10-4-1 Applicability of Special Exceptions  
Any use designated as a Special Exception in any district as enumerated in this Ordinance shall comply 
with Section 10-4. 
 
10-4-2 Procedures for Application for Special Exception  
All applications for a special exception shall be submitted and approved prior to application for a Zoning 
Compliance Permit. A subdivision plat or a site plan meeting the requirements of this Ordinance and all 
other development regulations of the City of Madison shall be included in applications for Special 
Exceptions in all zoning districts. Site plan or subdivision approval shall not be granted prior to or 
contingent upon Special Exception approval. 

 

A Special Exception shall be processed by the Planning Department and granted by the Zoning Board of 
Adjustment only in accordance with the following: 

1. Application and fee (See Chapter 16-2 Madison Code of Ordinances)( for a Special Exception 
must be submitted to the Planning Department thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing as

Planning Department to the Technical Review Committee members for review comments.  

2. All Special Exception applications shall be made to the Board in writing on applications provided 
by the Planning Department. If the applicant is an agent for the property owner, a notarized 
letter from the property owner authorizing the agent to make application and represent the 
property owner before the Board of Adjustment must accompany the application. 

3. The applicant shall submit with each application a notarized list of names and addresses of all 
adjoining property owners as recorded in the appropriate county’s Office of Probate. Using the 
applicant-provided list, the City will mail a public hearing notice letter no later than ten (10) days 
prior to the public hearing. The letter will include the following information: 

a. Legal description of the property and the street address or approximate location in the 
City of Madison; 

b. Present zoning classification of the property and the nature of the Special Exception 
requested; and 

c. Date, time, and place of hearing. 
4. The applicant shall submit a site plan and/or subdivision plan meeting all City of Madison 

requirements for such and demonstrating the Special Exception Permit is in compliance with the 
provisions of this Ordinance and especially those listed in Section 10-4-3. 

5. The Planning Department will review the location, the application and all other portions of the 
application and produce a report (including an analysis of the proposal and recommendations) 
regarding the findings and any conditions which should be considered by the Board of 
Adjustment as conditions.  

6. Upon receipt of said completed written application, fee, and list, a notice of public hearing 
before the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be given by notice on the City of Madison website 
or other proper notification method. Said notice shall be published no less than five (5) days

10-4-3 Standards of Review for a Special Exception  
No application for a Special Exception shall be approved unless the Board of Adjustment shall specifically 
find the proposed use appropriate in the location for which it is proposed. This finding shall be based on 
the following criteria: 

1. The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and 
standards of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under 
consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City. 

2. The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue adverse 
effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, 
public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, 
safety, and general welfare either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed 
as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this Ordinance, or any other plan, 
program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the 
City or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development. 

3. The proposed use will be adequately served by, and will not impose an undue burden on, any of 
the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection. Where any such 
improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or adequate to service the 
proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part of the application and as a 
condition to approval of the proposed Special Exception permit, be responsible for establishing 
ability, willingness, and commitment to provide such improvements, facilities, utilities, and 
services in sufficient time and in a manner consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, 
programs, maps, and ordinances adopted by the City to guide its growth and development. The 
approval of the Special Exception Permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, 
facilities, utilities, and services being provided and guaranteed by the applicant. 

4. The Board of Adjustment may attach recommendations for Special Exception approval, 
additional criteria dealing with buffer yards, parking, lighting, building materials, signage or any 
other aspect of site plan approval necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed Special 
Exception on the surrounding property. All conditions imposed upon any Special Exception 
permit approval, except those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly 
set forth in the order granting such Special Exception permits. Unless and until prescribed 
conditions are met, no Zoning Compliance, Certificate of Occupancy, or Business License shall be 
granted for the applicant for the Special Exception at the property. 

5. The application shall be denied if the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds that the application and 
record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance. Further, the application 
shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any mitigating conditions 
that might be imposed by the Board of Adjustments, outweigh any public or private benefits of 
the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall public health, safety, and welfare. 

10-4-4 Approval or Denial of a Special Exception  
1. In granting any Special Exception, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall issue a Special Exception 

Permit and prescribe the appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this 
Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under 
which the Special Exception is granted, shall be deemed violation of this Ordinance and 
punishable under the penalty sections of this Ordinance.  



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

186 

 

   

2. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall prescribe a time limit within which the action for which 
the Special Exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or 
complete the action within the time limit set shall void the Special Exception.  

3. In the event a permit for a Special Exception is approved subject to conditions, the applicant 
shall submit a revised site plan meeting all conditions of approval. Only once approval is granted 
and/or all conditions are met will the Planning Department process the application on the 
Zoning Compliance for the use and/or development to which the Special Exception Permit 
applies. Any Zoning Compliance issued for a Special Exception shall have attached the signed 
order from the Board of Adjustment for the same.  

4. For any Special Exception approved, all permit requirements must be approved and a Certificate 
of Occupancy issued within twelve (12) months after Board action. The Zoning Board of 
Adjustment, upon recommendation by the Technical Review Committee, may make an 
extension of said permit approval for a single period of up to six (6) months from the date when 
that permit would otherwise expire. An extension may be granted only if the Board of 
Adjustments concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in 
good faith and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new 
application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than thirty 
(30) days before the expiration of the permit stating the reason for the time extension request. 
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant 
shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this section. 

5. If the Special Exception Use is discontinued for more than twelve (12) months, then the Special 
Exception shall be deemed expired.  

Section 10-5. Variances  
 
10-5-1 Purpose for Variances  
It is expected that the granting of variances, an empowerment of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, will 
be rare; however, a variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, 
shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary 
and exceptional situations or conditions attributable to a piece of property, the strict application of any 
regulation enacted under this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on 
the owner of such property. Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this 
Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the 
Zoning Board of Adjustment. This shall include existing development sites proposed for expansion or 
reconfiguration and which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance. The site plan may 
be reviewed concurrently and approved conditionally with review and action on the variance request, 
but the site plan shall not be approved for development until the variance has been approved. 
 
10-5-2 Procedures for Application for Variances  
A Variance shall be processed by the Planning Department and granted by the Zoning Board of 
Adjustment only in accordance with the following: 

1. Application and fee (See Chapter 16-2, Madison Code of Ordinances) for a Variance must be 
submitted to the Planning Department thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing as required in 
Section 10-2-3, Public Hearings. Copies of the application will be distributed by the Planning 
Department to the Technical Review Committee members for review comments. 

2. All Variance applications shall be made to the Board in writing indicating the Section of this 
Ordinance under which the variance is sought, and stating the grounds upon which it is 
requested. The applicant must state the exact relief being sought from the application of specific 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

187 

 

   

regulation. Said submittal must be done on an application provided by the Planning 
Department. If the applicant is an agent for the property owner, the application must be 
accompanied by a notarized letter from the property owner authorizing the agent to make 
application and represent the property owner before the Board of Adjustment. 

3. The applicant shall submit with each application a notarized list of names and addresses of all 
adjoining property owners as recorded in the County Office of Probate. The City is responsible 
for mailing a public hearing notice letter no later than ten (10) days prior to the public hearing. 
The letter shall include the following information: 

a. Legal description of the property and the street address or approximate location in the 
City of Madison; 

b. Present zoning classification of the property and the nature of the Variance requested; 
c. Date, time, and place of hearing. 

4. The applicant shall submit a site plan and/or subdivision plan meeting all City of Madison 
requirements for such and demonstrating the Variance is in compliance with the provisions of 
this Ordinance.  

5. Upon receipt of said completed written application, fee, and list, a notice of public hearing 
before the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be given by notice on the City of Madison Website 
or other proper notification method. Said notice shall be published no less than five (5) days 
before the meeting of the Board.  

10-5-3 Standards of Review for Variances  
The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict application of the provision of this 
Ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards are satisfied. In general, the 
power to authorize a variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall be sparingly exercised. It is the 
intent of this Ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition 
of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using 
the property as intended by the Zoning Ordinance. Any variance granted shall be the minimum 
adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. 
 
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical 
difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In particular, the applicant shall 
establish and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and 
standards listed below: 

1. The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the 
regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall not be 
injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 

2. The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use which is not permitted 
in the district. 

3. There must be proof of unique circumstances or conditions fully described in the findings and 
applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought, such circumstances or 
conditions being peculiar to such land or buildings and generally having no application to land or 
buildings in the district, and which circumstances or conditions are such that the strict 
application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable 
use of such land or building.  

4. There must be proof of unnecessary hardship. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that 
greater profit would result if the variance were granted. Furthermore, the hardship complained 
of cannot be self-created nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases with or 
without knowledge of the restrictions. It must result from the application of this Ordinance; it 



The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Madison 
Updated November 2, 2022 

188 

 

   

must be suffered directly by the property in question; and evidence of other variances or non-
conformities granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered.  

5. That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and 
that the variance as requested from the Zoning Board of Adjustment is the minimum variance 
that will accomplish this purpose. 

6. That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent 
property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, 
endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the 
adjacent neighborhood. 

7. That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege 
that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 

The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of 
the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies. 

 

Section 10-6. Zoning Compliance 
  
10-6-1 Applicability 
No use, improvement, and/or development of property permitted by this Ordinance, including 
accessory and temporary uses, may be established and no existing building may be altered with respect 
to its use after [enter the effective date of this Ordinance] until a Zoning Compliance Certificate has 
been issued by the Planning Department. 
 
Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the additional responsibility of seeking any permit required 
by any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulations in compliance with all of the terms of this 
Ordinance. 
 
Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other ordinances. The violation of any 
condition contained in an approval of or in reliance upon in the issuance of the Zoning Compliance 
Certificate shall be a violation of this Ordinance. 
 
10-6-2 Application Requirements for Zoning Compliance Certificate 
All applications for Zoning Compliance Certificates shall be made in writing by the owner or developer of 
the property for which it is sought. The application provided by the Planning Department shall be filed 
with the Planning Department and include the following: 

1. Name of the business; 
2. Applicant name and contact information; 
3. Legal and full property address for which the certificate is sought; 
4. Special Exception Permit, if required, and the signed order attached to the application; and 
5. Request for site plan review, if required (e.g., required for conversion from residential use to

In the case of any development located within a subdivision, the subdivision shall have received final 
plat approval and been recorded before the Planning Director will accept an application for a Zoning 
Compliance Certificate. If the development for which a zoning certificate is sought is required by this 
Ordinance to undergo site plan review, the approved site plan shall be made a part of the application for 
a zoning certificate and shall suffice as the statement of proposed use required by this Section. 
 
A temporary use and an accessory use shall require a zoning certificate as a precondition to their lawful 
establishment. The Planning Director may establish regulations governing the application requirements 
for a zoning certificate in the case of either a temporary or accessory use that is established at any time 
other than simultaneously with a principal use, in which case all information specified in this Section 
shall be submitted. The purpose of the required information is to provide the Planning Director with a 
sufficient factual basis to determine whether all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to temporary 
and accessory uses have been met. 
 
10-6-3 Procedures for Issuance of a Zoning Compliance Certificate 
All proposed uses, alterations, conversions, or developments for which a Zoning Compliance Certificate 
is required shall be reviewed for compliance with this Ordinance. Within ten (10) calendar days after the 
complete application for a zoning certificate has been accepted, the Planning Department shall inform 
the applicant whether the application has been granted. 

1. In any case where the application is granted, the Planning Director shall issue a Zoning 
Compliance Certificate which shall state: “This certificate does not signify building codes review 
or approval or subdivision review or approval and is not authorization to undertake any work 
without such review and approval where either is required. Before any structure to which this 
certificate is applicable may be occupied or used for any purpose, a certificate of occupancy 
must be obtained.” 

2. In any case where an application is denied, the Planning Director shall state the specific reasons 
and shall cite the specific chapters, articles, and sections of this Ordinance upon which denial is 
based. If relief of such denial would be available by special permit or variance, the Planning 
Director shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the appropriate sections of this Ordinance. 

10-6-4 Penalties 
Any person who fails to obtain a Zoning Compliance Certificate prior to applying for a business license, 
building permit, certificate of occupancy or prior beginning construction, use or erecting a sign shall be 
subject to doubling of all applicable fees of the process. Furthermore, the Planning Department will 
notify all other approving departments and agencies of the violation of zoning compliance.

no others, except that with the following exceptions 
 

1. In residential day care facilities, outside play shall be permitted to the extent required by State

service provider. For example, clergy may counsel individuals outdoors, artists may work 
outdoors, etc.

certain athletic instruction, may be so provided, if it generates no effects beyond the property 
line any greater than would normally be expected for a residence. In no event shall musical 
instrument instruction be provided outdoors. 

 
B. The use shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes, and 
the appearance of the structure shall not be altered by the occupation within the residence, nor be 
conducted in a manner that would cause the premises to differ from its residential character either by 
the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or the emission of sounds, or vibrations that 
carry  beyond the premises. (Ord.92-25) 
 
C. The total area used for such purposes(including storage) shall not exceed the equivalent of one-half of 
the floor area, in square feet, of the first floor of the user's dwelling unit, if any; otherwise, the main

(Ord. 92-25)

or products, provided that incidental retail sales may be made in connection with other permitted home 
occupations; for example, a single-chair  beauty       parlor would be allowed to sell combs, hair spray 
and other miscellaneous items to customers. However, a dressmaker would be required to do only 
custom work for specific clients and would not be allowed to develop stocks of dresses for sale to the 
general public on-site. 
 
F. There shall be no exterior storage on the premises of material used in the home occupation nor of any 
highly  explosive or combustible  material.  No activity shall be allowed which would interfere with radio

started to rapidly increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations and thereby impair the

14-2-1 Applications  
Individuals wishing to conduct a home occupation in a dwelling that they own may apply to the Director 
of Community Development for a Home Occupation   Permit on forms available from the Department. 
Individuals   other  than the dwelling owner who  wish to conduct a home occupation in the dwelling 
must submit a letter from the owner granting permission for the home occupation along with the 
application, or the application will not be accepted. A one-time fee of $30 shall be paid to the 
Department with the application. 
 
14-2-2 Classification and Approval  
The Director of Community Development will classify Home Occupation Permit Applications as Major or 
Minor Home Occupations.  Major Home Occupation Applications will be referred to the Board of 
Adjustment for processing in   accordance with Section 10-8 of the Zoning Ordinance. Minor Home 
Occupation  Applications will  be approved administratively by the Director or his designee upon  
presentation  of  representations  and/or  verifications provided by the applicant, provided that the 
Director or his  designee finds that the conditions established in Section 14-1-1 of this Ordinance are 
met. Minor Home Occupation Applications  that are denied administratively may  be appealed to the 
Board of Adjustment under the provisions of Section 10-7, or by resubmitting the application as a Major 
Home Occupation and requesting a Special Exception under Section 10-8 of this Ordinance.  
 
14-2-3 Inspections 
The Director of Community Development or his designee shall have the right, at any reasonable time, 
and upon reasonable request, to enter and inspect the premises covered by a Home Occupation Permit, 
in order to ensure compliance with the terms of said permit, or for other lawful reasons. 
 
14-2-4 Permits  
Applicants whose requests for Home Occupation Permits are approved shall pay an annual fee of $7.50 
to the City Clerk on or before January 1 of each year for the privilege of conducting the home 
occupation. Said fee shall be in addition to fees for a City of Madison Business Privilege License, and any 
other fees required by law. The City Clerk shall refuse to renew a Home Occupation Permit on advice 
from  the  Director  of  Community  Development  that representations  made  on the Home  Occupation  
Permit Application are, or have become, an inaccurate description of the business, or that other 
conditions in this Ordinance are not being met.

14-2-5 Transferability  
Home Occupation Permits are not transferable between individuals, nor are they valid for a location 
other than the location noted on the permit. An individual who moves may not resume their home 
occupation in the new location without reapplying for a Home Occupation Permit. 
 
14-2-6 Prior Nonconforming Home Occupations  
Individuals who have received Special Exception Approval from the Board of Adjustment to operate a 
home occupation shall be exempt from reapplying for Home Occupation Permits, provided that the 
home occupation has been pursued continuously since the approval was granted. However, such 
individuals must purchase Home Occupation Permits for the year after the year in which this Ordinance 
becomes effective. Individuals who operate home occupations, who have not received Special 
Exceptions to do so, shall have four months from the date of this Ordinance to apply for a Home 
Occupation Permit without penalty. Thereafter, individuals who are found to be engaging in home 
occupations without the necessary permits shall be subject to penalties provided for in Section 13-2 of 
this Ordinance.
