purposes of: 

•	 promoting the health, safety, morals, public peace, order, or general welfare of the City of Alexander

•	 lessening congestion in the streets; 
•	 securing safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; 
•	 providing adequate light and air; 
•	 preventing the overcrowding of land; 
•	 avoiding undue concentration of population; 
•	 facilitating the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other pub-  
 lic requirements;

•	 encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings throughout the City; 

all in accordance with a comprehensive plan, the City Council of the City of Alexander City, Alabama, does 
hereby ordain and enact into law this Zoning Ordinance. This ordinance has been designed to protect and 
accommodate competing interests in the use, enjoyment and development of land within the City of Alex-
ander City. Every possible consideration has been given to the public interest, individual property rights and 
the impacts, or externalities, associated with the development of land in Alexander City.  It is the goal of this

citizens and property owners of Alexander City.

matter thereon shall be made a part of this Ordinance by reference.  This map may be known and cited as the 
“Alexander City Zoning Map.”  Such map shall be filed in the Office of the City Clerk, and shall show thereon 
the date of adoption and dates of amendment by the Alexander City City Council. 

SECTION 3 - INTERPRETATION 

In this interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered minimum require-
ments adopted for promotion of the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and general wel-
fare of the community.  The standards and requirements of this ordinance should be applied and enforced 
to balance public and private interests in the development of land in a manner that promotes mutual under-
standing and respect, and with prompt and just consideration given to the various interests involved in land 
investment, ownership, and development. 

SECTION 4 - JURISDICTION OF ORDINANCE 

The requirements and standards contained in this Ordinance shall apply to all areas within the corporate 
boundaries of the City of Alexander City.

ARTICLE III GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 

SECTION 1 - USES 

Zoning affects every property, building, and use. Unless otherwise provided herein, no building or parcel of 
land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or part thereof shall be erected, moved, or altered 
except for a use expressly permitted within the zoning district in which it is located. All uses not specifically 
permitted within a zoning district shall be prohibited.  Uses classified as “permitted” within a zoning district 
shall be approved by the Enforcement Officer, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions specified 
in the Zoning Ordinance.  Uses classified as “special exceptions” shall be permitted only by the Board of Adjust-
ment, as outlined in Article VII of this Ordinance, subject to such special conditions as the Board of Adjustment 
may be authorized to impose to preserve and protect the character of the applicable zoning district. 

SECTION 2 - STRUCTURES 

It is the intent of this Ordinance that no more than one principal use structure shall be located on any single 
lot of record, plus any permitted accessory structures.  Accessory structures shall not include functionally in-
dependent living quarters. 

SECTION 3 - HEIGHT AND DENSITY 

3.1  Height of Structures. In each district, each structure hereafter erected or altered shall not ex-
ceed the height limits specified in this Ordinance. Height limitations shall not apply to church steeples, 
belfries, cupolas and domes (not intended for human occupancy), barns, silos, windmills, farm structures, 
chimneys, flag poles, public utility poles, monuments, radio and television towers and all such struc-
tures specifically exempted from local zoning regulations by applicable federal law, cooling towers, water 
tanks, smoke stacks, derricks, conveyors, and similar structures required to support manufacturing and 
industrial processes. 

3.2  Intensity of Use. Each building and lot shall not be used or occupied hereafter by more fami-
lies or for a higher intensity of use than permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. 

SECTION 4 - ACCESSORY STRUCTURES 

Accessory buildings may be erected on any lot and shall be located so as to comply with the following require-
ments: 

4.1  No accessory building shall be erected in any required front or side yard and shall not occupy 
more than (30) percent of any required rear yard. Accessory buildings shall be sited at least five (5) feet

than the principal building on the lot. 

4.2  No accessory building that is not an integral part of the principal building shall be located less 
than sixty (60) feet from the front lot line. 

4.3  In the case of a corner lot adjoined in the rear by a lot facing the side street, the accessory struc-
ture shall be located in such a manner as to conform with the front and side yard requirements of the 
adjoining lot. 



22 

Article III: General Requirements
4.4  No clothesline shall be erected in a front or side yard. Clotheslines shall be set back at least ten 
(10) feet from any interior or rear lot line. 

4.5  Satellite receiving dishes. Satellite receiving dishes are permitted accessory uses in any dis-
trict, provided they comply with setback, height, and other standards of this ordinance. In any district, 
the dish antenna shall be located to the rear of the front building line and must be set back ten feet from 
any interior or rear lot line. Special setbacks indicated herein apply on corner lots. The dish antenna to-
gether with the principal building and accessory building may not exceed the maximum lot coverage 
permitted in the district in which it is located. In residential districts where the antenna is detached from 
the main building, its maximum height may a not exceed 15 feet. When roof-mounted, it must conform 
to the zoning district’s height limits and its installation must be checked for safety by the building in-
spector. Installation and construction must also comply with the building code. No form of advertising or 
identification is allowed on the dish or framework other than manufacturer’s small identification plates. 

4.6  Radio and television antennas. Private radio and television antennas for individual homes 
or for amateur use are permitted as accessory structures in any district and may be placed on roofs or in 
rear or side yards but may not come closer than five feet to any right-of-way or property line. Antennas in 
excess of the normal height limitations for the district in which they are located are subject to approval 
and permit by the Building Official, and a site plan showing location of the antenna must be submitted 
to the Building Official.

4.7  Heat pumps, air conditioner compressors, and other mechanical equipment shall not be locat-
ed in front yards. 

4.8 Prefabricated carports. All prefabricated carports are regulated as accessory structures and 
shall be submitted on a site plan to the Building Official for approval before installation.

SECTION 5 - LOTS 

5.1  Minimum lot size.  All lots created after the effective date of this Ordinance shall comply with 
the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district within which they are located. 

5.2  Lot reduction.  Except as herein provided, no lot, even though it may consist of one or more 
adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in area so that yards, lot area per family, lot width, building area 
or other requirements of this Ordinance are not maintained. 

5.3  Minimum frontage.  All lots shall have a minimum frontage of not less than fifty (50) feet along 
a public street or a private street dedicated for public use and constructed in accordance with all applica-
ble City street standards.  The minimum required frontage shall be reduced to thirty-five (35) feet for lots 
fronting on the round-about at the end of a permanent cul-de-sac. 

SECTION 6 - YARDS AND OPEN SPACE 

6.1  Required yards and open spaces. In each district, each structure hereafter erected or altered 
shall be provided with the yards specified, and shall be on a lot of the area and width specified in this 
Ordinance. No open space or lot required for a building or structure shall, during its life, be occupied by 
or counted as open space for another building or structure. Except as hereafter provided, no yard or other 
open space provided, nor the off-street parking and loading spaces required, about any building for the 
purpose of complying with the regulations of this Ordinance shall hereafter be included as a part of a 
yard or other open space, or the off-street parking or loading spaces, for any other building. 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     23

Article III: General Requirements
6.2  Yards and open spaces on substandard lots.  Where the owner of a property, at the time of 
adoption of this Ordinance, has a lot or lots of official record which are substandard to the requirements 
of the district in which they are located according to this Ordinance, the building and its accessory struc-
tures may be built, provided: 
A. The yard space and other requirements conform as closely as possible, in the opinion of the Board of 

Adjustment, to the requirements of the district in which the property is located. 
B. That neither side yard shall be reduced to less than five (5) feet. 
C. No building shall be required to set back more than the average of the setbacks of the existing resi-

dences within one hundred (100) feet each side thereof, but in no case shall the front yard setback of 
any building hereafter erected or altered be less than twenty (20) feet. 

SECTION 7 - BUILDING SETBACK LINES 
 

7.1  Properties abutting existing improved public streets.  When any required yard abuts a street 
or roadway with an existing public street right-of-way of forty (40) feet or more, the setback shall be the 
standard setback required in that zoning district. The setback shall be measured from the property line. 

7.2  Properties abutting street or roadways without dedicated rights-of-way.  When any re-
quired yard abuts a street or roadway (public or private) without a dedicated right-of-way, the setback 
shall be not less than twenty (20) feet, plus any additional setback required by the minimum dimensional 
requirements for the applicable zoning district. The setback shall be measured from the centerline of the 
existing improved street or roadway. 

7.3  Special Exemption from Front Yard Setback Requirements.  The City of Alexander City rec-
ognizes that existing development in older sections of the community have established a street front-
age line that may not fully comply with the specific front yard setback requirements of this ordinance.  
Although compliance with required front yard setbacks is desirable to protect buildings from potential 
future street widening projects and to ensure adequate front yards for landscaping and/or the provision 
of on-site parking, the City does not wish to casually destroy the character and appeal of a street by rad-
ically altering long-established street facades. Therefore, the City shall permit special front yard setback 
exemptions for buildings on lots that possess frontage on a street where the majority of the established, 
pre-existing buildings do not comply with the applicable front yard setback requirements of this ordi-
nance.  In accordance with this exemption provision, no building shall be required to set back more than 
the average of the setbacks of the existing buildings within one hundred (100) feet each side thereof, but 
in no case shall the front yard setback of any building hereafter erected or altered be less than twenty (20) 
feet. 

7.4  Future Street Lines.  On any lot which, at the time of adoption of this ordinance or at the time 
this ordinance is changed by amendment, may be reduced in area by widening a public street to a future 
street line as indicated in the duly adopted comprehensive plan, or as same may be hereafter amended, 
the minimum required yards, the minimum required lot area, the minimum required lot width, and the 
maximum building area shall be measured by considering the future street lines as the lot line of such lot. 

7.5 Traffic Visibility.  Additional setback distances may be imposed to any lot or property as re-
quired to maintain clear traffic visibility (as determined by the City Engineer and/or Building Official).  The 
additional setback distances may be applied to regulate any obstruction, including, but not necessarily 
limited to: buildings, trees, shrubs, decorations, wall or fences, and signs. 

SECTION 8 - FRONTAGE ON CORNER LOTS AND DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS 



24 

Article III: General Requirements

On lots having frontage on more than one street, the side or rear yard setback along the secondary street 
shall not be less than the required front yard setback for the applicable zoning district. When the rear yard of 
a lot abuts a public street, all buildings or structures in that rear yard shall observe the same setback from the 
street right-of-way line as required for adjacent properties which front on that street. In addition, any structure 
located within 25 feet of that setback line shall observe the side yard requirements of the adjoining properties 
fronting on that street. 

SECTION 9 - ACCESS TO STREETS 

No building for human occupancy shall be erected without unrestricted vehicular access to a public street or a 
private street dedicated for public use and constructed in accordance with all applicable City street standards. 
Furthermore, In order to promote the safety of the motorist and pedestrian and to minimize traffic congestion 
and conflict by reducing the points of contact, the following regulation shall apply: 

9.1  A point of access, i.e., a drive or other opening for vehicles onto a street, shall not exceed thirty 
(30) feet in width, but if the street is a major street and freeways, or arterial street, the width shall not 
exceed fifty (50) feet. 

9.2  There shall be no more than two points of access to any one public street on a lot of any width, 
unless required by the Board of Adjustment to provide adequate access to lots with more than four hun-
dred (400) feet of continuous street frontage. Lots less than one hundred (100) feet in width shall have no 
more than one point of access to any one public street. 

9.3  No point of access shall be allowed within fifty (50) feet of the right-of-way of any public street 
inter-section. However, a lessor distance may be authorized by the City Engineer, where conditions at 
the intersection or the constraints of the property may so warrant, and where such adjustment shall not 
compromise traffic safety or contribute to traffic congestion. 

9.4  The area existing between the street and an interior parking space or driveway parallel to the 
street shall have a curb at least six (6) inches in height and six (6) inches in width separating the parking 
area from the sidewalk, to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto the sidewalk area. 

SECTION 10 - FENCES AND WALLS 

10.1  Height on residential properties. Fences or walls that divide the front yard of a house from 
the adjoining street shall not exceed a height of four (4) feet.  In the case of a corner lot, fences or walls 
that divide the front and adjoining side yard of the house from the adjoining streets shall not exceed a 
height of four (4) feet. 

10.2  Building permit required.  Fences that exceed eight (8) feet in height shall require a building 
permit and shall be subject to any and all applicable requirements of the Building Department. 

10.3  Appropriate materials.  Fences and walls shall be constructed of a durable material such as 
treated lumber, brick, chain link or equal materials and be attractive in appearance. Barbed wire fencing 
shall be allowed only in the RR - Reserve Residential District.  Razor wire shall not be permitted as part of 
any wall or fence, except by special exception of the Board of Adjustment within a manufacturing district, 
where special measures are clearly required to secure the property from public intrusion. 

10.4 Fences near roadways.  No fence or wall may be erected in the public right-of-way or within twenty 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     25

Article III: General Requirements
(20) feet of the edge of a street or curb. 

SECTION 11 - NOISE STANDARDS
 
Any use to be located within the City of Alexander city shall satisfy the following noise standards: 

11.1  On any lot or tracts within residential districts, noise levels shall not exceed 60 dBA between 
7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. and 55 dBA between 7:00 p.m. 7:00 a.m. 

11.2  On any lot or tract within commercial, industrial and floodway districts, noise levels shall not 
exceed 70 dBA between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. and 65 dBA between 7:00 p.m. and 
7:00 a.m. 

11.3  For any use with questionable noise levels, a plan of compliance shall be required by the build-
ing official. The plan shall show how the above specific standards will be met. 

11.4  Measurements shall be taken with an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) type I or 
type 2 sound level meter using the a-weighted scale. 

11.5  Reasonable flexibility and application of noise regulations shall be allowed for short time peri-
ods, however, noises in excess of 90 dBA shall not be allowed at any time. 

SECTION 12 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Stormwater runoff from construction sites and urban development is a significant source of surface water 
contamination.  Since the clean ground and surface waters are important economic resources to Alexander 
City, new development and construction activity must be designed to minimize on-site erosion and the re-
sulting sedimentation of off-site water resources that can be generated by stormwater runoff.  Therefore, no 
final inspection of a development site shall be conducted by the City until the developer has complied with 
all applicable requirements of this Section. The City may request assistance from the Natural Resource Con-
servation District or other qualified experts in evaluating the applicant’s proposed measures to comply with 
these requirements. 

12.1  Exempt activities.  The following activities shall be exempt from these stormwater manage-
ment requirements: 
A. Minor land disturbing activities normally associated with single family uses, such as home gardens, 

landscaping, building repairs or alterations, swimming pool installation, or other related, low-impact 
activities. 

B. Agricultural practices or the construction of farm buildings, when conducted in full compliance with 
all applicable Best Management Practices. 

C. Private and commercial forestry activities, when conducted in full compliance with all applicable Best 
Management Practices. 

12.2  ADEM permit required. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to secure compliance with 
all applicable Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) Construction Stormwater 
Management Administrative Code rules, as amended, and/or any applicable ADEM construction site 
permit requirements, which are designed to prevent/minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the 
discharge of sediment and other pollutants in construction stormwater runoff to ensure the protection 
of water quality in accordance with applicable Federal and State law.  Applicants subject to this require-
ment shall provide evidence that a stormwater discharge permit has been issued by ADEM prior to the 



26 

Article III: General Requirements
issuance of a zoning permit by the Enforcement Officer. 

12.3  Tie-in required.  All proposed drainage improvements shall tie into any existing man-made or 
natural drainageways along the existing public streets adjoining the development site. Under no condi-
tions shall stormwater drainage be emptied into the sanitary sewer system or vice-versa. 

12.4  Basic guidelines.  Stormwater management measures shall be designed in accordance with all 
applicable Best Management Practices for the proposed type of construction activity. Appropriate short-
term (during construction) and long-term (after construction is complete) measures shall be applied to 
minimize potential erosion of disturbed soils on the development site.  All slopes on the development 
site in excess of ten (10) percent grade shall be permanently stabilized through the use of natural vege-
tation (preferably native vegetation), retaining walls, terracing, or a combination, as may be appropriate. 
Development sites which will contain more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of impervious 
surfaces or upon which more than fifty (50) percent of the total lot area will consist of impervious sur-
faces shall contain adequate stormwater management facilities (detention or retention basins, drainage 
ways, storm drains, etc.) to accommodate on-site and safely release or transmit the runoff that would be 
generated by a twenty-five (25) year storm event, without causing an increase or surge in the volume and 
velocity of off-site peak stormwater runoff over the pre-development state.  However, if the site is located 
within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone, the stormwater management facilities shall be designed to ac-
commodate on-site and safely release or transmit the runoff that would be generated by a one hundred 
(100) year storm event, without causing an increase or surge in the volume and velocity of off-site peak 
stormwater runoff over the pre-development state. 

12.5  Creative and innovative polluted runoff management practices. Where feasible and appro-
priate, proposed developments may incorporate creative and innovative design to minimize the impacts 
of polluted runoff on the environment.  Such design features may include, but are not limited to, un-
disturbed natural buffers between impervious surfaces and adjoining streams and drainageways, max-
imum retention of existing mature trees on building lots, the use of seeded shallow “V” drainage swales 
(with stabilized cut slopes not to exceed a ten [10] percent grade) rather than concrete curb and gutter, 
the use of porous pavement surfaces for parking lots, service roads, alleys, and cul-de-sacs, the use of 
crushed gravel or turf parking areas for small parking lots or spillover parking areas, and the creation of 
wetlands for stormwater detention and retention, and other practices as may be appropriate to address 
on-site stormwater drainage needs.  Such creative and innovative design features should be used in the 
following development settings; 

A. where they will be compatible with existing off-site stormwater management infrastructure improve-
ments serving the drainage basin, and 

B. where appropriate to adequately and safely accommodate the stormwater runoff that would be gen-
erated by the proposed level of impervious surfaces without the need for excessive perpetual main-
tenance. 

12.6  Lot Drainage Standards.  The following design requirements for lot drainage shall be satisfied 
in each Stormwater Management Plan: 
A. A positive slope of finish grade shall be provided around each structure to direct water away from all 

foundations, slabs, or footings; 
B. Side lot swales shall be utilized, as necessary, to direct lot drainage into public drainage improve-

ments or easements; 
C. Roof drains shall be utilized to prevent soil erosion and to prevent the accumulation of stormwater 

runoff along structure foundations and footings.  Such drains shall be directed away from structures 
and into swales or other drainage facilities; 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     27

Article III: General Requirements
D. Driveway culvert pipe shall be the proper size to safely transmit design storm event drainage waters. 

The inside diameter of such culvert pipe shall be at least fifteen (15) inches, and shall consist of a dou-
ble wall plastic or concrete pipe;

E. All driveway and service drive piping shall be installed on an appropriate grade to prevent standing 
water. 

12.7  Erosion and Sediment Control.  The following erosion and sediment control measures shall 
be observed for the construction and maintenance of all stormwater management facilities: 
A. Roadside ditches, swales, and embankments within each dedicated right-of-way or drainage ease-

ment shall be properly stabilized in accordance with applicable Best Management Practices to pre-
vent excessive erosion from cut slopes; 

B. It shall the developer’s responsibility to provide the necessary measures to ensure that clearing, grub-
bing, grading, landscaping, and other construction activities do not adversely affect the drainage 
structures that are essential to overall stormwater management and control; 

C. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to ensure proper implementation, regular inspection, and 
continual maintenance of effective Best Management Practices for construction site erosion and sed-
iment control; 

D. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to promptly remove and/or remediate, to the extent practi-
cable, any off-site sediment from the development site that is washed or deposited into municipal 
stormwater drainage facilities. 

12.8  Stormwater management on privately owned common open space lands.  Where any 
stormwater management improvements are to be constructed on common open space lands within the 
development, such improvements shall be subject to special maintenance provisions as required in Arti-
cle IV, Section 10 (Common Open Space Requirements) of this Ordinance. The City of Alexander City shall 
assume no responsibility or liability for the continued, maintenance, improvement, or repair of privately 
owned stormwater management facilities. 

12.9 Stormwater management plan required. A maintenance plan and schedule for stormwater 
facilities for any commercial structures and subdivisions with greater than 50 lots shall be approved by 
the City Engineer and Building Official before any permits shall be issued.

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
ARTICLE IV SPECIAL USE PROVISIONS 

SECTION 1 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 

1.1  Purpose of provisions. Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance or by sub-
sequent amendments to this Ordinance, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and 
characteristics of use which were lawfully created, established, or constructed before this Ordinance was 
adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this 
Ordinance or of subsequent amendments.  It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconfor-
mities to continue until they are removed or discontinued, but not to actively encourage their survival.  It 
is further the intent of this Ordinance to ensure that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded, or 
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same 
district.  Nonconforming status runs with the land; i.e., a change in ownership or tenancy does not termi-
nate the nonconforming status of a lot and/or structure. 

1.2  Incompatibility of nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by this Ordinance 
to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the zoning districts in which they are located. A noncon-
forming use of land, of structure, or of land and structure in combination shall not be extended, enlarged, 
moved, or otherwise intensified after passage of this Ordinance either by additions to any existing struc-
ture or by the addition of other uses of the property which would be generally prohibited in the district 
in which such use is located. 

1.3  Vested rights. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require 
a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building upon which actual construction 
was lawfully initiated prior to the effective date of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance. 

1.4  Abatement of noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, and fire and explosion hazard or 
nuisance.  The Enforcement Officer may require the conduct of any use, conforming or nonconforming, 
which results in unreasonable noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, radio interference, or explosion 
hazard or nuisance to surrounding properties to be modified or changed to abate such hazards to health, 
comfort, and convenience.  The Enforcement Officer may issue an abatement order, but such order may 
be directed only after a public hearing has been conducted by said Enforcement Officer, notice of which 
shall be sent by registered mail to the owners and/or operators of the property on which the use is con-
ducted, in addition to due notice by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the com-
munity.  A hearing to consider the issuance of an abatement order shall be held by the Enforcement 
Officer either upon petition signed by any person affected by the alleged hazard or nuisance or upon 
the Enforcement Officer’s initiative.  An abatement order shall be directed by the Enforcement Officer 
only upon reasonable evidence of hazard or nuisance, and such order shall specify the date by which the 
hazard or nuisance shall be abated. 

1.5  Single nonconforming lots of record. A lawfully created lot of record which does not meet 
the minimum space and height requirements of the zoning district in which it is located at the effective 
date of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance may be used or sold for the erection of those build-
ings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out the permitted uses in that district, provided: 

A. Minimum space and height requirements of the lot shall conform as closely as possible to the appli-
cable standards for the district. 

B. Requirements for yards and setbacks, accessory buildings and uses, and off-street parking and load-
ing spaces shall conform as closely as possible to the applicable standards for the district. 

C. Variance for area, dimensional, and other requirements shall be obtained only through action of the 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     29

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
Board of Adjustment as authorized in Article VII, Section 5.3  of this Ordinance. A variance shall only 
be required where the proposed structure cannot be designed to comply with the applicable dimen-
sional requirements of the zoning district. 

1.6  Creation of Nonconforming Lots of Record Prohibited. No existing lot of record (whether 
conforming or nonconforming) shall be divided in a way that would create a lot that does not comply 
with the applicable minimum space and height standards of this Ordinance.  Nothing in this provision 
shall be interpreted to prevent the adjustment of an adjoining lot line or the resubdivision of a lot so 
combined, where sufficient land area exists to establish more than one conforming lot. 

1.7  Nonconforming Structures. Where, at the effective date of adoption of or amendment to this 
Ordinance, a lawful structure exists that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason 
of not complying with minimum dimensional requirements or other requirements concerning the struc-
ture, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 

A. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconfor-
mity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 

B. A nonconforming structure which has been partially damaged by fire or other causes may be recon-
structed and used as before if it is completely repaired within twelve (12) months of such damage. 
However, should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed 
by any means to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its fair market value immediately prior 
to damage, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. 

C. Should such structure be voluntarily relocated or moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, 
no permit shall be issued unless and until it fully conforms (in regards to location, construction, and 
use) to the requirements or standards for the district in which it is located after it is moved.  This pro-
vision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the replacement of a pre-existing, nonconforming manu-
factured or mobile home, as long as it is replaced with a conforming manufactured home, the unit is 
placed in the exact location of the previous home or a more conforming location on the lot, and the 
replacement manufactured home does not create any new dimensional nonconformities. 

D. No building permit shall be issued for the remodeling or renovation of a building or structure which 
contains a use that does not conform to the provisions of the district in which it is located, except as 
provided in Section 1.7-B above. Only routine maintenance for which no building permit is ordinarily 
required shall be allowed. 

1.8  Nonconforming Uses of Land/ Structure or Land and Structure in Combination. Where, 
at the time of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance, lawful uses of land, structure, or land and 
structure in combination exist which, under the terms of this Ordinance, would not be permitted in the 
zoning district in which they are located, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise 
lawful, provided: 

A. No such nonconforming uses, nor structures devoted to nonconforming uses, shall be enlarged or 
increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the 
Ordinance or subsequent amendment that created the nonconformity. 

B. No such nonconforming uses, nor structures devoted to nonconforming uses, shall be moved in 
whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the 
effective date of adoption of or amendment to this Ordinance, unless approved by the Board of Ad-
justment as a special exception to specifically reduce or minimize the overall nuisance or impact 
generated by the nonconforming use on all neighboring properties or to reduce or to specifically 
eliminate one or more pre-existing dimensional nonconformities.  Where such a special exception is 
requested, the Board of Adjustment shall also determine that the proposed relocation shall create no 



30 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
opportunities for expansion or intensification of the nonconforming use and will create no additional 
or new dimensional nonconformities. 

C. No additional structures (primary or accessory) shall be erected in connection with nonconforming 
uses, unless approved by the Board of Adjustment as a special exception to specifically enclose a 
pre-existing open air and essential activity of the use in a way that will significantly enhance the 
exterior appearance of the property and screen, reduce, or eliminate the overall nuisance or impact 
generated by the nonconforming use on all neighboring properties. Where such a special exception 
is requested, the Board of Adjustment shall also determine that the proposed new structure shall 
create no opportunities for expansion or intensification of the nonconforming use and will create no 
additional or new dimensional nonconformities.  Any such new structure permitted by special excep-
tion shall not be classified as or permitted as a pre-existing, nonconforming structure.

D. If any such nonconforming uses are discontinued for a period of more than twelve (12) months, any 
subsequent use of the land and/or structure formerly devoted to such nonconforming uses shall 
thereafter conform to the requirements or standards specified by this Ordinance for the zoning dis-
trict in which such land and/or structure is located. 

E. If any nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, any subsequent use of the land and/or 
structure formerly devoted to such nonconforming uses shall thereafter conform to the requirements 
or standards for the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be 
resumed. 

F. A nonconforming use may change to a new nonconforming use as a special exception (subject to 
appropriate conditions as warranted in this Ordinance for a special exception), where the Board of 
Adjustment has determined that the new use is more consistent with the permitted uses of the dis-
trict in which it is located and is less objectionable and generates fewer external impacts on neigh-
boring uses and properties than the previous nonconforming use.  However, once the pre¬existing 
nonconforming use has been replaced by a more conforming use, the prior nonconforming use may 
not thereafter be resumed under any circumstances.  To determine whether the new use would be in 
greater conformity with this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the six criteria listed 
below.  In finding that the proposed use change will be in greater conformity, the Board of Adjust-
ment shall conclude that at least one of the six criteria will be satisfied and that the proposed new use 
shall cause no adverse impact under all of the remaining applicable criteria.
1. The proposed use will reduce the amount of  traffic generation and congestion generated by the 

property, including truck, passenger car, and pedestrian traffic. 
2. The proposed use will reduce or eliminate external noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, heat, 

odor, glare, or vibration caused by the original nonconforming use. 
3. The nature of the proposed new use or business activity will be more consistent or compatible 

with other uses permitted in the district. 
4. The scale and intensity of the new use or business activity will be clearly less or smaller than the 

original nonconforming use.  
5. For all nonresidential uses, the proposed new use or business activity will be conducted during a 

shorter time period and more reliably during regular weekday business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 
p.m.) than the original nonconforming use. 

6. The proposed new use or business activity will be conducted entirely within existing structures 
on the premises, thereby eliminating pre-existing, nonconforming open air activities associated 
with the original nonconforming use. 

G. Where nonconforming use status applies to land and structure in combination, removal or destruc-
tion of the structure to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its fair market value immediate-
ly prior to damage shall terminate the nonconforming status of the structure but shall not terminate 
the nonconforming status of the land.



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     31

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
1.9 Repairs and Maintenance. 

A. On any structure devoted entirely or in part to a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary 
maintenance, including remodeling, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, 
or plumbing, provided the maintenance, remodeling, or repair work shall not result in an increase in 
the cubic content of the structure, as it existed at the effective date of the Ordinance or subsequent 
amendment that created the nonconformity. 

B. On any lot devoted entirely or in part to a nonconforming use, work may  be done on ordinary main-
tenance, repair, or replacement of parking and loading areas, signs, lighting, fences, walls, and related 
exterior amenities, provided the extent of those amenities shall not be increased or rearranged. 

C. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition 
of any structure or exterior amenity declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the 
public safety, upon order of such official. 

SECTION 2 - GROUP HOMES 

Group homes shall be conducted within a building that is consistent or compatible with the character of the 
district in which it is located. 

2.1  No exterior changes incompatible with residential character.  A group home located in a  single 
or two family residential district shall be conducted within a building that shall maintain the exterior 
appearance of a typical dwelling unit in that district or neighborhood, with no separate external doors to 
individual bedrooms. 

2.2  Group homes in multi-family and nonresidential districts.  A group home in a multi¬family or 
business district may be conducted in a building other than a single family dwelling, provided that the 
group home conforms to the characteristics described in the definition of “group home” in Article II of this 
Ordinance. 

2.3  Compliance with all applicable State laws.  Where applicable, the group home shall provide 
evidence that it will operate in compliance with any applicable State licensing requirements.  

SECTION 3 - MANUFACTURED HOMES 

All manufactured homes shall comply with the following requirements prior to occupancy: 

3.1  H.U.D. seal required. Prior to installation, each manufactured home shall bear a seal certifying 
compliance with the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act promulgated by the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Any lawfully existing mobile home or manufac-
tured home not bearing such seal shall be deemed a nonconforming structure and shall be treated as 
a nonconforming structure and use in accordance with the regulations established in Section 1 of this 
Article. 

3.2  Anchoring requirements. All manufactured homes shall be set up, installed, and anchored  in 
full compliance with the requirements of the Alabama Manufactured Housing Commission.  Each manu-
factured home site shall be properly prepared for set up and installation as may be necessary and appro-
priate to prevent the accumulation of standing water or the drainage of stormwater runoff beneath the 
manufactured home. 

3.3  Skirting required. All manufactured homes shall be skirted with a weather-resistant material 



32 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
which resembles siding materials commonly found on a single family dwelling.  Exterior siding should 
not have a high-gloss finish and should be residential in appearance, including, but not limited to, clap-
boards such as conventional vinyl or metal siding, wood shingles, shakes, or similar material, but ex-
cluding smooth, ribbed, or corrugated methal or plastic panels.  Concrete block or brick and mortar 
foundation walls, constructed in compliance with all applicable building code requirements, shall be the 
preferred method of skirting. The exterior siding material must extend to the groung except that, when a 
solid concrete or masonry perimeter foundation is used, the exterior covering material need not extend 
below the top of the foundation.  Where the space beneath a manufactured home that is to be enclosed 
by skirting is not completely covered by a concrete pad, then a ground vapor retarder of 6 mil rated poly-
ethylene sheeting or greater shall be installed over the entire area enclosed by skirting. All skirting shall 
be adequately vented. 

3.4  Axles and tow bars removed.  Once a manufactured home has been placed on an individual 
lot, all tow bars and axles shall be removed and stored in a location on the lot where they cannot be seen 
from the street, neighboring homes, or adjoining properties. 

3.5  Access to exterior entrances.  Immediately after installation and prior to occupation, steps 
and a landing or porch shall be constructed at each raised exterior entrance or doorway to the manu-
factured home.  At a minimum, the front or main entrance to a manufactured home shall be served by a 
stairway (not less than three feet in width) leading to a landing or porch not narrower than five (5) feet in 
depth (as measured outward from the exterior of the structure) nor shorter than eight (8) feet in length 
(centered along the entranceway) and containing a railing along all exterior edges of the landing and 
stairway.  A stairway (not less than three feet in width) with exterior railings shall be erected at all other 
exterior entrances to the manufactured home.  All required stairways and landings/porches shall be con-
structed of pressure treated wood or brick materials, or some combination of both.   Required railings 
may be constructed of pressure treated wood or metal materials. 

3.6  Sanitary facilities.  Each manufactured home shall contain at least one shower or tub, a flush 
toilet, a lavatory, hot and cold running water, and a central source of heat for the occupants thereof. 

3.7  Landscaping.  All manufactured homes located on individual lots (not in a manufactured home 
park) shall be landscaped in a manner consistent with other adjoining residential home sites in the area 
or neighborhood.  At a minimum, ornamental shrubs shall be applied along the front yard foundation or 
skirting of each manufactured home. 

3.8  Orientation.  When sited on an individual lot (not in a manufactured home park) each man-
ufactured home shall be oriented on the lot so that it meets all setback and area requirements of the 
zoning district. Wherever possible, the unit shall be located with its long axis parallel with the street. 

3.9  Minimum width.  When sited on an individual lot (not in a manufactured home park) each 
manufactured home shall be at least twelve (12) feet in width. 

3.10  Fuel storage facilities.  All fuel oil supply systems serving a manufactured home that is sited 
on an individual lot (not in a manufactured home park) shall be constructed and installed within the 
foundation wall or underground in accordance with all applicable building and safety codes, except that 
any bottled gas tanks may be fenced or screened so as not to be clearly visible from the street or abutting 
properties. 

3.11  Number allowed.  Not more than one (1) manufactured home shall be permitted on any indi-
vidual lot that is not located within a manufactured home park. 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     33

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
3.12  Use limitations.  No manufactured home may be used for any purpose other than as regulated 
for residential use herein except in a nonresidential zoning district as provided below:
 
A. As an office and storage for parts at a legally licensed manufactured home sales lot by the owner, real 

estate office, or sales office. 
B. A temporary construction office or a temporary residence at a construction job site provided that 

such use shall cease when a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
C. Campaign headquarters, to be removed immediately after election day. 
D. Showing of exhibits or special products for a period not to exceed fourteen (14) days. 
E. For special sales or promotions by civic or nonprofit organizations, to be removed on a specified date. 

3.13  Compatibility With Adjoining Residential Properties.  While the City of Alexander City ac-
knowledges and accepts its responsibility to promote a wide range of affordable housing styles for its 
residents, it also must recognize that manufactured homes are a distinct type of housing that can, un-
der certain circumstances, alter or disrupt the stability of property values and character of established 
residential neighborhoods that consist predominantly or exclusively of site-built single family detached 
dwellings.  Such disruptions can be especially severe in neighborhoods that consist of historic homes that 
represent and reflect a specific architectural style and character or that consist of uniformly high value 
dwellings, relative to the value of a standard manufactured home.  In these special neighborhoods, the 
City’s responsibility to provide siting flexibility for manufactured homes must be reasonably tempered 
and balanced by the City’s competing responsibility to maintain the character, architectural integrity, and 
property value stability of established single family residential neighborhoods.  Therefore, manufactured 
homes may be permitted only in full compliance with the following special conditions: 

A. the proposed manufactured home will not be located on a vacant lot that is within a designated local, 
state, or federal historic district or a vacant lot that is adjacent to one or more structures that have 
been listed on or are eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places; 

B. the combined value of the proposed manufactured home and the property upon which it will be 
sited shall not be less than ninety (90) percent of the average fair market value of all adjoining proper-
ties that have been improved for single family residential use, according to the property value records 
maintained by the County Tax Assessor’s Office; 

C. no manufactured home shall be utilized as a parsonage on or adjacent to a lot containing a church; 
and 

D. each manufactured home shall comply with all applicable dimensional requirements and minimum 
standards for dwellings required for the subject zoning district in which it will be located. 

SECTION 4 - HOME OCCUPATIONS AND COTTAGE INDUSTRIES 

4.1  Home Occupations. A home occupation may consist of any permitted accessory business use 
that fully complies with all of the standards contained in this section.  No home occupation shall be al-
lowed in any multi-family dwelling. 

4.2  Cottage Industries. A cottage industry may consist of any permitted accessory business use, 
except solid waste facilities, junkyards or scrap metal shops, automobile repair shops, body shops, or 
food processing/packing operations, that fully complies with all of the standards contained in this sec-
tion. Cottage industries may be permitted only within the RR, Reserve Residential Zoning District.

of this Ordinance, the owner shall cease and desist from all business operations until such time as 
the enforcing officer has verified, through on-site inspection, that the violation has been remedied.  
Failure to cease and desist from all business operations, in accordance with this provision, shall con-
stitute a separate violation. If the owner fails to comply with a cease and desist order, or the violation 
has not been remedied within fifteen (15) days of the date that the notice of violation was issued, the 
home occupation or cottage industry permit and business license shall expire and no resumption of 
business activities associated with such business may occur without first obtaining a new permit and 
business license. 

SECTION 5 - OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS 

5.1  Basic design requirements for parking lots. Required parking spaces, as set forth below, shall 
provide not less than two hundred fifty (250) square feet of total parking lot area per space and shall 
be located entirely outside of the street right-of-way.  Each individual standard (non-handicap) parking 
space or stall shall be at least nine (9) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length. Required spaces shall 
have an all-weather surface, an unobstructed maneuvering space, and access lanes of adequate width 
leading to a street or alley. Overflow or reserve parking areas in excess of the minimum spaces required 
herein may be constructed of permeable surface materials, including gravel, crushed stone, or other 
porous pavement materials designed to serve the anticipated intensity or frequency of overflow parking 
and to prevent excessive soil erosion. Porous pavement surfaces may be applied to required parking ar-
eas, provided the pavement is adequately designed to serve the anticipated traffic load and the surface 
is properly cleaned and maintained.  Except for one and two-family dwellings, maneuvering and turning 
areas shall be provided so that no vehicles will be required to back into a street. Only vehicles in oper-
ating condition shall be allowed to occupy required parking spaces. All off-street parking lots located in 
the B-2, General Business zoning district shall provide a buffer between the parking lot/facility and any 
adjoining street. 

5.2  Definitions.  Within the context of this Section, the following definitions shall apply: 
A. Reference herein to “employee(s) on the largest work shift” means the maximum number employees 

employed at the facility regardless of the time period during which this occurs and regardless of 
whether any such person is full-time employee. The largest work shift may be a particular day of the 
week or a lunch or dinner period in the case of a restaurant. 

B. The term “capacity” as used herein means the maximum number of persons that may be accommo-
dated by the use as determined by its design or by fire code regulations, whichever is greater. 

5.3  Off-street parking spaces required.  This section identifies the minimum number of off-street 
automobile parking spaces required for specified uses.  Where a particular use is not specifically men-
tioned, the requirements of a similar or related use shall apply, as deemed appropriate by the Enforce-
ment Officer.  Where more than one type of use will be conducted on a specific site, the site shall satisfy 
the combined requirements of all specified uses. Required parking spaces shall include spaces designat-
ed for people with disabilities, the number and design of which shall be in accordance with the standards 
set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

A. Agriculture support uses: One space per employee on the largest shift, plus one space per 200 
square feet of gross floor area provided for customer sales and service operations.

ticle IV, Section 5.3 above may be adjusted in compliance with the following procedures and conditions: 

A. Minimum off-street parking requirements for properties zoned B-3, Central Business District may be 
reduced by not more than twenty (20) percent where the subject property abuts a street where dedi-
cated on-street diagonal parking is available or by ten (10) percent where the subject property abuts 
a street where dedicated parallel parking or a combination of parallel and diagonal parking is avail-
able. 

B. The board of adjustment may authorize a reduction of, or waiver, any of the off-street parking or load-
ing-unloading regulations when it can be demonstrated clearly to the satisfaction of the board that 
circumstances of extreme practical difficulty exist that would unquestionably result in hardship to 
the applicant when a literal application of the regulations is required.  Hardship shall not be deemed 
economic, but shall be evaluated in terms of the use of the parcel of land. A hardship that is a result 
of any action of the applicant shall not be considered by the board of adjustment.  Under all these 
circumstances, the only reduction or modification that shall be authorized is that necessary to over-
come the evidenced difficulty; and in no case shall the requirements be reduced by more than 25 
percent. 

5.5  Handicap Parking Guidelines. Handicap parking and access facilities for new construction 
and changes in occupancy for existing construction shall be provided, designed, and constructed in ac-
cordance with Chapter 11, Accessibility for People with Physical Disabilities of the City’s building code, as 
may be amended.  In addition, such facilities should be designed and constructed in conformance with 
the Accessability Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (dated July 26, 1991) promulgated by the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as may be amended.  To the extent that conflicts between the require-
ments of these two codes may arise, the applicant shall be responsible for satisfying the City’s building 
code. Although the City of Alexander City encourages property owners to afford the maximum possible 
accessibility for persons with disabilities, the City shall not assume any liability for any individual private 
property owner’s failure to comply with the standards and requirements promulgated by the ADA.  All 
handicap parking provided by a property owner should, to the maximum extent feasible, achieve the 



40 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
following objectives: 

A. Afford sufficient visibly dedicated handicap parking to adequately satisfy customer and employee 
needs. 

B. Site designated handicap parking spaces in an area of the property that affords the most convenient 
and safe access to the main entrances of the principal use building on the property. 

C. Incorporate adequate handicap access to and within the principal use building on the property and 
any additions thereto. 

5.6  Plans and Specifications Required for Off-Street Parking Spaces. Plans and specifications 
showing required off-street parking spaces, including the means of access and interior circulation, shall 
be submitted to the enforcing officer for review at the time of application for a zoning permit. 

5.7  Location of Parking Spaces. 

A. Except for one and two family dwelling units, if required parking spaces cannot be provided on the 
same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on adjoining off-
street property, provided that the required spaces are located no farther than four hundred (400) feet 
from the main entrance of the principal use. Such parking spaces shall be associated with the permit-
ted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 

B. Parking spaces designated for use by people with disabilities shall be located in close and convenient 
proximity to the main entrance of the building with which they are associated, in accordance with the 
standards set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act. All required handicapped parking spaces 
shall be provided on-site. 

5.8  Truck Parking Restrictions. No trucks larger than one (1) ton pick-up trucks shall be permitted 
to park in any residential district, except that a truck or commercial vehicle not greater than one and one 
quarter (1.25) tons may be parked in an off-street accessory structure within a residential district, pro-
vided the vehicle is not parked for more than sixty (60) consecutive hours. This restriction also applies to 
street parking. 

5.9  Joint Use of Off-Street Parking Areas. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to pre-
vent the joint use of an off-street parking area or facility by two or more buildings or uses if the total of 
such spaces, when used together, shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various indi-
vidual uses or buildings computed separately. 

5.10  Landscaping.  All paved surface parking lots containing more than thirty (30) parking spaces 
shall incorporate, within the paved area, landscaped islands constituting not less than ten (10) percent of 
the total paved portions of the parking lot. The area of any required islands shall not be counted as part of 
the required minimum parking area for the off-street parking lot. Landscaped islands shall be distributed 
broadly throughout the parking lot and designed to provide sufficient unpaved area to support healthy 
plant growth and root structures. Each landscaped island shall also be designed to accommodate at 
least one shade tree, which shall be not less than ten (10) feet tall at planting. Shrubs, flowers, and other 
ornamental plants or ground cover shall be incorporated into the landscaping on each island. Special 
consideration shall be given to native plants and trees when selecting vegetation and additional consid-
eration shall be given to the location of trees and tall shrubs with respect to above ground power lines, 
light poles, and other possible obstructions, to prevent the need for excessive pruning as the trees and 
shrubs grow and mature. 

5.11  Plans and Specifications Required for Off-Street Loading and Unloading Spaces. Plans

42 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
and arranged as to be usable thereby.

trance of the principal structures of the property, and shall be established as required by the Standard fire 
Prevention Code s adopted and amended by the city, and at other locations as deemed necessary by the 
fire chief. It shall be the responsibility of the building owner to paint, sign, and mark all required fire lanes

5.14  Continuing character of obligation. Required off-street parking and loading spaces associat-
ed with newly erected or altered buildings or newly established uses of land shall be a continuing obli-
gation of the owner of said building or land so long as the structure or use exists or its use requiring such 
parking or loading facilities continues.  Apart from the discontinuance, sale, or transfer of the building or 
use, it shall be unlawful for said owner to discontinue, change, dispense with, or cause the discontinu-
ance or change of the required vehicle parking or loading space without establishing alternative vehicle 
parking or loading space which meets the requirements of and is in compliance with this Ordinance; or 
for any person to use a building or lot without providing vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet 
the requirements of and are in compliance with this Ordinance.

SECTION 6 - ACCESSORY RESIDENTIAL UNITS 

Technological and medical advances have made it possible for people to live longer lives and to live more 
independently than ever before.  At the same time, a declining number of young adults must provide care 
and support for an expanding elderly population, despite increased work demands to make ends meet.  The 
City of Alexander City understands the demands faced by working adults, and seeks to provide an option for 
families to provide special and convenient care for elderly and handicapped members.  However, the City 
must also preserve the character and integrity of single family neighborhoods and exercise appropriate reg-



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     43

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
ulatory constraints to guard against the potential proliferation of rental apartments in such neighborhoods.  
The purpose of this Section is to establish basic standards for the development of accessory residential units 
to provide a semi-independent living environment for family members who require special care and support 
from the primary household.  Such a unit would provide greater privacy and personal freedom than an add-
ed bedroom within the primary dwelling, but would not create an additional independent living unit that 
would alter the character of the original single family structure and the surrounding neighborhood. However, 
nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the creation of an accessory residential unit to provide 
in-home care for an elderly or handicapped family member.  Accessory residential units shall be allowed only 
for single family dwellings, excluding manufactured homes.  Where permitted, all accessory residential units 
must comply with all of the following requirements. 

6.1  Incomplete facilities for exclusive personal use. The purpose of this provision is to provide 
opportunities for families to provide essential on-site care and support for elderly and handicapped 
members, not to provide opportunities for families to create independent rental units for general leas-
ing. Therefore, accessory residential units must be designed to prevent independent use. All accessory 
residential units must lack either complete kitchen facilities or bathroom facilities for exclusive personal 
use.  An incomplete kitchen must lack either a convection oven/stove or a kitchen sink. An incomplete 
bathroom must lack either a toilet or shower/bathtub. The remaining kitchen or bathroom facilities nec-
essary to serve the accessory residential unit must be provided within the primary dwelling unit.  The 
applicant shall provide evidence that the sewage disposal needs of the additional accessory bedroom(s) 
can be satisfied by the existing sewage service.  No separate meters for utility service shall be established 
or provided for any accessory residential unit. 

6.2  Maximum floor area.  Accessory residential units shall contain not more than five hundred  
(500) gross square feet or twenty-five (25) percent of the total improved floor area of the primary residen-
tial dwelling, whichever is less. 

6.3  Leasing agreement prohibited. No accessory residential unit shall be leased to a tenant 
through any formal leasing agreement or contract.  Any reimbursement arrangements for use of the unit 
or support services provided to the tenant shall be on an informal and incidental basis. 

6.4  Contained within primary dwelling.  An accessory residential unit must be attached to (by 
a common wall) or contained within the primary dwelling unit on a property.  No accessory structure or 
outbuilding on the lot may be used or modified to serve as an accessory residential unit. Not more than 
one (1) exterior entrance to an accessory 
residential unit shall be permitted. 

6.5  Limit on number of units.  Where permitted, no more than one (1) accessory residential unit 
shall be allowed per primary dwelling. 

6.6  No change in character of structure. An accessory residential unit shall be designed to cause 
no apparent change in the exterior residential character or appearance of the primary dwelling unit. 

6.7  Documentation of need.  Accessory residential units are intended to serve specific family or 
household needs that would be better satisfied by the creation of a semi-independent living environ-
ment.  Applicants who desire to construct an accessory residential unit shall submit a written statement 
to the enforcement officer describing the need that will be served by the accessory residential unit.

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
SECTION 7 - SIGN REGULATIONS 

7.1  Purpose of Sign Regulations. The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the con-
struction, maintenance, and regulation of outdoor advertising within the City.  While Alexander City ac-
knowledges the legitimate public need for business visibility, local businesses must also recognize the 
legitimate public need for a beautiful and uncluttered community and the City’s legitimate need to en-
sure safe traffic circulation on City streets.  Local experience within Anniston, Gadsden, Atlanta, and Bir-
mingham generally supports the contention that excessive, competing signage along public streets can 
create visual clutter, which makes it difficult for motorists to see traffic control and highway safety signs 
and to quickly judge where entrances to adjoining businesses are located. The City also has determined 
that excessive, competing signage can divert motorist attention from the highway, which contributes 
to traffic accidents.  The City also wishes to protect its established historic small city character and scale 
from the appearance of cluttered and excessive signage. Therefore, Alexander City has determined that 
it is desirable to prescribe the manner of sign construction and to compel the use of safe materials; limit 
the number, type, surface area, height, and location of signs; and require clean and sanitary maintenance 
of signs in order to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the community.  Further, 
these sign regulations are intended to lessen hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic; preserve prop-
erty values; prevent unsightly and detrimental development which has a blighting influence upon the 
community; and, in general, preserve the character and aesthetic quality of the various zones within the 
City. 

7.2  Sign terms defined.  The following sign terms, when used in this Ordinance, shall have the 
meanings defined by this section.

IV, Section 7.6 (C) of this Ordinance shall not be deemed grandfathered. 

B. Alterations.  A nonconforming sign shall not be rebuilt, expanded, moved, or altered in a way that 
would increase the degree of nonconformity as it existed at the time the grandfather status was 
conferred.  This requirement shall not be interpreted so as to prohibit proper maintenance of a non-
conforming sign or changes to the copy of the sign that do not increase the existing degree of non-
conformity. 

C. Expiration.  A nonconforming sign shall not be rebuilt or re-established after its use has been discon-
tinued or abandoned under the terms of Article IV, Section 7.6, unless approved by the City Council.

streets.  When approving additional freestanding signs, the Building Official may increase the max-
imum cumulative sign area allowed for the property as needed to permit the intended additional 
freestanding sign. Freestanding signs shall be located as close a possible to the main traffic access to 
the property, but shall not be located closer than five (5) feet to the right-of-way of a public street. In 
addition, no freestanding sign shall be located less than fifty (50) feet from another freestanding sign 
on the same side of the street or less than one hundred (100) feet from another freestanding sign on 
the same property.

In no instance shall the increased height allow the top of the freestanding sign face or copy to 
extend more than twenty-five (25) feet above the nearest surface elevation of the paved street. 

3. Maximum sign face or copy height: Ten (10) feet. A greater maximum sign face height may be 
granted by the City Council for a freestanding sign that will serve all businesses in a shopping

flush to the wall, and shall not project more than twelve (12) inches away from the wall surface, ex-
clusive of any approved lighting fixtures. Where wall signs are to be placed on a building of historical 
significance (especially if located within the downtown area or an older neighborhood), the wall sign 
shall be sized and positioned in a way that will complement the historic character and charm of the 
building. The following dimensional requirements also shall apply to all permitted wall signs:

and appearance of telecommunication towers, antennas, and satellite dishes under the Telecommunica-
tions Act of 1996, where such control does not conflict with or unreasonably constrain the legitimate right 
of businesses to exercise free trade.  Alexander City desires access to advanced technology to serve its 
businesses and citizens, but not at the expense of the community’s overall appearance and public image.  
Alexander City seeks to impose sensible controls on telecommunication facilities, in order to maintain 
the aesthetic character and charm of the community and its neighborhoods against the insensitive and 
uncontrolled proliferation and placement of steel lattice towers and other telecommunications facilities.  
New telecommunications towers should not create a cluttered landscape or dominate the community’s 
skyline as it is viewed from the primary highway entrances to Alexander City. To that end, the City de-
sires to partner with telecommunications firms to ensure expansion of the existing telecommunications 
infrastructure that will provide effective advanced communications services throughout the City and 
surrounding environs, commensurate with local needs, with a minimal visual impact on the character 
and charm of the community, and without creating impediments to free competition among wireless 
telecommunications providers seeking to serve the City.  These regulations have been developed by the 
City to achieve the aforementioned objectives. 

8.2  Definitions. The following sign terms, when used in this Ordinance, shall have the meanings 
defined by this section. 

A. Antenna.  An electromagnetic device which conducts radio signals, through an attached cable or 
wave guide, to or from a radio transmitter or receiver.  “Antenna” includes devices commonly known 
as “whips,” “panels,” and “parabolic dishes.” “Antenna” shall include an antenna used in conjunction 
with microwave, cellular, or personal communication service systems and any other type of telecom-
munications systems now or hereafter in use. 

B. Applicant.  A party or parties who apply for a permit to construct a tower, to install an antenna on a 
proposed or existing tower, or to locate equipment on a proposed or existing tower compound. 

C. Co-Location Site. A parcel of land or other site on which the antennas and related equipment of 
more than on party are located. 

D. Communication Facilities.  Towers, antennas, and associated equipment collectively. 
E. Equipment.  All equipment and facilities used in conjunction with one (1) or more towers and/or

tenna; provided, that the word “monopole” shall not include a latticed steel or metal tower, a tower 
which requires guy wires for support, or a tower which has more than one (1) source of support, such 
as a tower with more than one (1) leg. 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     55

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
J. Residential Property. Any land which is located in a Residential Zoning District– RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, 

MHP, and R-3M. 
K. Surveyor. A person who is registered with, and licensed by, the State of Alabama as a surveyor. 
L. Tower.  Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or 

more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term 
includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cel-
lular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and any other like structure used to support 
wireless telecommunications transmission facilities now or hereafter in use. As used in this Section, 
“tower” shall include any telecommunication tower installed or constructed within the City prior to 
the effective date of this ordinance, regardless of whether such tower is a monopole or another type 
of tower. 

M. Tower Compound.  A parcel of land or a building on which communication facilities are located. 

8.3  Jurisdiction of Regulations.  All communication facilities or structures greater than one (1) 
meter in size, including but not limited to those facilities known as “cellular”, “personal communication 
system (PCS)”, “paging services”, and similar services, shall comply with these regulations.  However, the 
following shall be exempt from these regulations under the specified conditions: 

A. Public Property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by 
the City of Alexander City, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been 
approved by the City Council. 

B. Amateur Radio or Receive-Only Antennas. Any tower, or the installation of any antenna that does 
not exceed the maximum height restriction of the applicable zoning district or seventy (70) feet–
whichever is less–and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator, 
or is exclusively for receive-only antennas. 

C. Pre-Existing Communication Facilities or Towers.  Any communication tower or antenna which 
was constructed prior to the effective date of these regulations and which complied with all applica-
ble State, Federal, and Local codes, laws, and regulations in effect at the time of construction, provid-
ed, however, that all pre-existing communication facilities or towers shall submit a written request of 
exemption to the Enforcement Officer within six (6) months of the effective date of these regulations.  
The written request shall state the name, mailing address, business and home telephone numbers 
of the owner, the street address and tax parcel identification number of the property upon which 
the communication facilities are located, and the date upon which construction of the facilities was 
complete.  All written requests containing the required information shall be automatically approved 
if received within the above specified deadline. 

8.4  Basic Requirements and Design Considerations. All proposed communication facilities 
(towers and antennas) governed by these regulations shall comply with the following requirements and 
guidelines. 

A. Compliance with FAA Regulations.  All proposed communication facilities shall comply with all ap-
plicable FAA requirements, including but not limited to, Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
(FAR), as amended. 

B. Compliance with FCC Regulations.  All proposed communication facilities shall comply with all 
applicable FCC requirements, including but not limited to, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as 
amended. 

C. Structural Safety.  All proposed communication facilities shall comply with wind loading and other 
applicable structural standards contained in local building and technical codes, as they may be in 
effect and amended from time to time, including, without limitation, the Southern Standard Building 
Code and the Electronic Industries Association Code and any amendments thereto or replacements 



56 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
thereof, as may be adopted by the City Council.  The City’s Building Inspector or his/her designee shall 
determine whether a proposed communication facility will comply with this requirement. 

D. Appearance and view protection.  All proposed communication facilities, with the exception of 
proposed antennas that will be co-located on a pre-existing tower, shall be attractively camouflaged, 
disguised, or hidden in a manner that it will blend into the surrounding environment to the greatest 
extent possible.  Examples of proper camouflaging include: designing a tower to resemble a tree, 
designing a monopole to look like and function as a flag pole or freestanding sign support, hiding an 
antenna within a church steeple, or any other effective means of disguising the appearance of a tow-
er or antenna that may be appropriate for the setting in the area surrounding the proposed commu-
nication facility site.  It shall be the burden of the applicant to document and prove that a proposed 
communication facility cannot be effectively camouflaged, before approval of a non-camouflaged 
structure may be permitted by the City.  In such instances, the applicant shall explore alternative 
means of minimizing the visual impact of the antenna, such as installing it onto an existing telephone 
pole, streetlight, or building rooftop, rather than erecting a new tower specifically for the proposed 
antenna. However, in no instance shall a non-camouflaged communication facility be approved for a 
residential property. 

E. Signs prohibited.  No signs or other forms of advertising, including signs displaying the name of the 
owner or user of the tower or antenna, may be attached to or depicted on a communication facility, 
unless the proposed facility is a new monopole specifically camouflaged and approved to serve as 
a permitted freestanding sign support.  This prohibition shall not apply to any required warning or 
private property posting signs. 

F. Construction materials.  Where applicable building codes, technical codes, and federal regulations 
permit flexibility in the choice of construction materials and where the selection of alternative con-
struction materials will not compromise the structural integrity of the proposed communication facil-
ity, proposed new towers and monopoles shall be constructed of materials that have a composition, 
texture, and color that will most closely resemble structures and natural features that exist on and 
adjoining the facility site. 

G. Health Effects.  All proposed communication facilities shall comply with all applicable FCC regula-
tions and requirements in effect to prevent detrimental health effects from the proposed commu-
nication facilities.  Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the City cannot deny a request to 
construct a communication facility on the grounds that its radio frequency or electromagnetic emis-
sions would be harmful to the environment or the health of residents, if those emissions meet FCC 
standards. 

H. Interference with Existing Communication Facilities. All proposed communication facilities shall 
comply with all applicable FCC regulations and requirements in effect to prevent interference with 
existing communication facilities serving the area. 

I. Siting Requirements for Whip Antennas.  Whip antennas shall not be allowed on a wall mounted 
antenna structure. 

J. Co-location.  No new tower or monopole shall be erected on a proposed communication facility site 
unless the applicant can document and prove that an existing co-location site is not available or is 
not technically capable of serving the specific telecommunication need in the area of the proposed 
site.  This co-location requirement may be waived by the City where the proposed antenna would 
create an excessively cluttered appearance on the available co-location site (thereby drawing greater 
visual attention to the existing antenna site or creating a more imposing obstruction to scenic views 
and vistas from the area) and the proposed new antenna would be less visible or intrusive on the 
surrounding area if effectively camouflaged on an alternate site. 

K. Setback Requirements.  All proposed communication facilities and structures, including guys and 
accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district in which 
they will be sited.  However, all proposed tower compounds that will be located on a residential 
property shall be subject to an additional setback from all property boundaries of the site equal to 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     57

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
the height of the tower structure as measured from the finished ground level at the base or pad sur-
face to the tallest point of the structure. If the tower compound abuts a property with an existing or 
approved (but not yet constructed or completed) residential use, the residential property setback re-
quirement shall be satisfied for all property boundaries of the site that abut said existing or approved 
residential uses. 

L. Lighting.  Towers may not be artificially lighted, except where required to satisfy applicable FAA reg-
ulations. Lights for security and to assist in making emergency repairs may be installed on buildings 
within the tower compound which contain equipment essential to the operation and maintenance 
of the tower. Such lights shall be shielded and directed in a downward direction from a height of not 
more than ten (10) feet, and no such light may exceed a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) watts. 
Such lights shall be located and directed so that they do not shine, reflect, or generate excessive glare 
onto or toward any residential property or adjoining property upon which a residential use exists or 
has been approved for construction. 

M. Security Fence.  All communication facilities to be located within a proposed tower compound shall 
be secured by the construction of an eight (8) foot high security fence or wall constructed, at a mini-
mum, using chain link fencing. 

N. Landscaping.  All proposed tower compounds must be surrounded by a landscaped buffer which 
shall provide an effective year-round screen to a height of at least eight (8) feet upon planting in 
order to screen views of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, residential properties, and 
properties upon which a residential use exists or has been approved for construction. The buffer shall 
include a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet in depth located outside of the security fence or wall. 
The landscaped strip shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, vines, and grown covers 
which are capable of attaining, at maturity, a height as high as the security fence or wall and which 
will enhance and screen the outward appearance of the security fence.  The use of native species of 
plants and trees are encouraged to the extent that they will satisfy the requirement for adequate 
year-round screening.  The applicant shall provide documentation to show what forms of vegetation 
will be planted within the landscaped area and how the area will be effectively maintained to ensure 
the long-term health of the plantings. Such documentation shall include the name, mailing address, 
and business telephone number of the party who shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair 
of the communication facilities and any fences, walls, and landscaped buffer areas. If the person or 
party responsible for such maintenance and repair changes any time after approval has been issued, 
the owner of the tower must provide the City’s Enforcement Officer with written notice of the new 
party’s name, mailing address, and business telephone number and the date upon which the change 
will become effective. 

O. Communication Facility Siting Priorities.  When selecting sites within the City to locate proposed 
communication facilities or tower compounds, priority shall be given to locations in non-residential 
zoning districts. Residential property sites shall be given the lowest possible consideration for new 
sites. 

P. Access and Parking. A driveway and parking area with a surface appropriate for the intensity of 
use shall be provided for each proposed tower compound to provide adequate access to the tower 
compound for the maintenance and repair of the communication facilities and for vehicle providing 
emergency services.  Subject to the approval of the City Council and to an appropriate agreement 
with the owner thereof, access and parking for the tower compound may be provided on an adjoin-
ing property or along one or more public streets adjoining the tower compound. 

8.5  Levels of Review and Approval. In recognition of the high standards for proposed communi-
cation facilities established by this Ordinance, allowances have been made for an efficient and, in certain 
instances, expedited review process, where the applicant can demonstrate that a good faith effort to 
embrace and comply with the spirit and intent of these guidelines has been made in the design of the 
proposal.  The three levels of review and approval and the types of projects that can be considered within 



58 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
each level are as follows: 
A. Review and Approval by Enforcement Officer. The following types of communication facilities shall 

be reviewed and approved by the Enforcement Officer without the need for a public hearing, provid-
ed the proposed improvements fully complies with all requirements specified in Section 8.4 of this 
Article: 
1. Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be co-located on an existing ap-

proved or registered pre-existing tower, as long as the proposed antenna(s) will not protrude at 
any point from the exterior surface of said tower by a distance of more than four (4) feet and the 
tower will contain no more than five (5) antennas if the application is approved.  In addition, the 
supporting equipment for the proposed antenna(s) shall not require the construction of any new 
freestanding structures on the tower compound. 

2. Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be sited in an existing structure that 
fully conforms with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance (not a non-conforming struc-
ture) and where, after installation, the antenna and all supporting equipment will be completely 
enclosed by the exterior walls of the structure or completely screened from public view at any 
point on the land within two (2) thousand feet of the proposed antenna. An example of such a 
scenario would be the placement of an antenna within the steeple of a church or the dome of 
a farm silo.  The addition of the antenna and supporting equipment to the existing conforming 
structure shall not require the construction of an addition to house the communication facilities.  
However, interior modifications to the structure may be permitted as part of the approval by the 
Enforcement Officer. 

B. Review and Approval Exclusively by City Council. The City Council shall have the authority to re-
view and approve the following specific types of communication facilities and tower compounds, 
subject to the conduct of a public hearing, but without the need for a formal recommendation from 
the Planning Commission:
1. Any antenna (and associated cables and equipment) that will be installed on a co-location site 

that does not fall within the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer, as specified in Sub-
paragraph A. 1. of this Section. 

2. Any new antenna (not including a tower) that will be attached to an existing structure that fully 
conforms with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance (not a non-conforming structure), 
but that would not otherwise fall within the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer as 
specified in Subparagraph A. 2. of this Section. 

3. Any new monopole not greater than thirty (30) feet in height and located in a non-residential 
zoning district that is camouflaged or disguised in such a way that it cannot be immediately rec-
ognized as an antenna support. 

4. Any new antenna or tower to be located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by 
the City of Alexander City and located within a non-residential zoning district. 

C. Review and Approval by City Council Upon Recommendation From Planning Commission. All 
applications not subject to review and approval by the Enforcement Officer in accordance with Sub-
paragraph A of this Section or review and approval exclusively by the City Council in accordance with 
Subparagraph B of this Section shall be subject to review and public hearings by both the Planning 
Commission and the City Council.  The Planning Commission shall review the application and issue a 
recommendation for approval or denial to the City Council. Final review and approval or denial of the 
application shall be issued exclusively by the City Council.

8.6  Approval Procedures. Review and approval of an application shall be conducted in accor-
dance with the following procedures.

A. Pre-Application Consultation.  Any applicant seeking to develop communication facilities or tower 
compounds that fall within the jurisdiction of these regulations may request an informal  consultation 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     59

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
with the Enforcement Officer and/or Building Inspector prior to the preparation and submission of a 
formal application. The purpose of this voluntary consultation shall be to answer specific questions 
about the process or applicable design requirements, discuss possible camouflaging or co-location 
options, or discuss application format options and/or potential supporting documentation submis-
sion needs.  Any such consultation discussions must occur before a formal application is submitted to 
the City, shall be non-binding on the applicant and the City, and shall not in any way constitute or be 
interpreted to constitute a decision to approve or deny an application. 

B. Receipt of Application.  All required applications shall be submitted to the Enforcement Officer.  
Upon submission, the Enforcement Officer shall determine that the application contains all submis-
sion requirements specified in Section 8.7 of this Article and is, therefore, complete.  No incomplete 
application shall be received by the City for review and approval. Once the Enforcement Officer de-
termines the application is complete, the application shall be determined to have been received by 
the City on that date. 

C. Enforcement Officer Review.  The Enforcement Officer and/or Building Official shall review a com-
plete application within thirty-one (31) days of the date of receipt. At the end of that review, the 
Enforcement Officer shall issue approval or denial for those aspects of the application that fall within 
the approval authority of the Enforcement Officer, as specified in Section 8.5, Subparagraph A of 
this Article. If the application or any part of the application is denied, the Enforcement Officer shall 
provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining the specific findings of fact used by 
the City as the basis of the denial.  Such denial shall be based on the unwillingness of the applicant 
to comply with the requirements of the regulations and/or the failure of the application to satisfy 
specific basic requirements and design considerations outlined in Section 8.4 of these regulations. If 
the Enforcement Officer fails to render a decision on the application within the required thirty-one 
(31) days, then aspects of the application subject to review and approval by the Enforcement Officer 
shall be deemed to be automatically approved without further consideration by the City.  However, 
the City Council may grant an extension to the thirty-one (31) day deadline not to exceed an addi-
tional thirty-one (31) days, due to extended illness or absence of the Enforcement Officer during the 
required review and approval period or the submission of an application that is too large or extensive 
to be reviewed by existing staff resources within the prescribed time frame.  On the date that the 
Enforcement Officer’s review period ends, any remaining portions of the application not subject to 
approval or denial by the Enforcement Officer shall be submitted to the City Council and/or Planning 
Commission for action, as may be applicable.  The forwarded application shall be accompanied by a 
written report from the Enforcement Officer regarding his/her assessment of the proposed commu-
nication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applicable requirements specified in Section 8.4 
of this Article. 

D. Planning Commission and City Council Review. All applications or portions of applications requir-
ing review and approval of the City Council and/or Planning Commission in accordance with Section 
8.5, Subparagraphs B or C of this Article shall follow the same general guidelines as for an amend-
ment to this Ordinance as specified in Article VIII (Amendments) of this Ordinance, with the specific 
exception that Planning Commission review shall not be required for applications that may be ap-
proved exclusively by the City Council, in accordance with Section 8.5, Subparagraph B of this Article. 

E. Public Hearing.  The City Council and, if necessary, Planning Commission shall each conduct one 
public hearing on the application at the earliest regular meeting date that will satisfy the public hear-
ing notice requirements following the date of submission by the Enforcement Officer.  The required 
public hearing shall be noticed in the same manner prescribed in the applicable Sections of Article 
VIII of this Ordinance (Section 4 for the Planning Commission and Section 5 for the City Council). At 
the hearing, the presiding body shall entertain a report from the Enforcement Officer regarding his/
her assessment of the proposed communication facility(ies) or tower compound(s) with the applica-
ble requirements specified in Section 8.4 of this Article.  A written copy of the Enforcement Officer’s 
report shall be incorporated into the minutes of the public hearing, along with a written synopsis of 



60 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
all public comments received and an attendance sheet identifying the names and mailing addresses 
of every person who attended the public hearing. 

F. Decision. The presiding body shall render a decision on the application within thirty-one (31) days 
from the date that the public hearing is closed.  For the Planning Commission, such decision shall 
be in the form of a written recommendation, along with a list of the findings of fact upon which the 
recommendation was based, to the City Council for final action.  If the Planning Commission fails to 
render a formal recommendation on the application within the required thirty-one (31) days, then 
the application shall be transmitted to the City Council for final decision with an automatic or implied 
recommendation of approval. If the City Council fails to render a decision on the application within 
the required thirty-one (31) days, then the application shall be deemed to be automatically approved 
without further consideration by the City.  If the application or any part of the application is denied, 
the City Council shall provide the applicant with a written letter of denial outlining the specific find-
ings of fact used by the City Council as the basis of the denial.  Such denial shall be based on the 
unwillingness of the applicant to comply with the requirements of the regulations or specific basic 
requirements and design considerations outlined in Section 8.4 of these regulations that the applica-
tion fails to satisfy. 

8.7  Submission Requirements.  All applications to construct communication facilities that fall 
within the jurisdiction of these regulations shall provide adequate documentation to demonstrate com-
pliance with all applicable basic requirements and design considerations specified in Section 8.4 of these 
regulations.  A single application may include any number of proposed tower compounds that will be 
located within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, even though some of the proposed tower compounds 
may be subject to expedited review procedures as provided in Section 8.5 of this Article. Where an ap-
plication includes tower compounds subject to different levels of review, the application may be divided 
into sections for each review category, within which all necessary supporting information for each pro-
posed tower compound shall be provided.  Whenever portions of an application have been approved or 
denied through an expedited review process, that information and any terms of said approval or denial 
shall be noted and considered in the subsequent review procedures for the remaining portions of the 
application. The Enforcement Officer shall determine the number of application copies that must be sub-
mitted by the applicant, based on the number of parties who must review the application. One (1) copy 
of the application shall be required for each of the following review agents, as may be required: the En-
forcement Officer, Building Inspector (if such person is not the Enforcement Officer), Planning Commis-
sion (as a body), and the City Council (as a body). At a minimum, each required application shall contain 
the following:

A. A completed zoning permit application form, including the required application fee. 
B. A site plan of the tower compound, prepared by a surveyor, at a scale not less than one (1) inch to 

fifty (50) feet, showing the location, street address, tax parcel identification number, and dimensions 
of the parcel of land that will contain the tower compound, the location of all required setback lines,  
driveways, parking areas, buffers, fencing, landscaping, stormwater management improvements, fuel 
tanks (both above and below ground), and structures that exist or will be constructed on the prop-
erty. If the property upon which a proposed tower compound will be located exceeds one hundred 
(100) acres in size, then the scale of the site plan shall be increased to one (1) inch to one hundred 
(100) feet, or the Enforcement Officer may grant authority to the applicant to limit the site plan cov-
erage to a specified area around the proposed tower compound. 

C. Written proof of ownership of the proposed tower compound or authorization to use it. 
D. A written report including a description of the proposed tower or antenna with the technical reasons 

for its design, a certificate from the project engineer documenting  the structural integrity of the 
tower or antenna support for its proposed use including any co-located communication facilities that 
may already exist at the site, and an affidavit signed by the owner of the proposed communication fa-



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     61

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
cilities and the project engineer attesting compliance of the proposed communication facilities with 
all applicable FCC requirements with regard to any potential detrimental health effects that could be 
generated by the proposed facilities. 

E. A silhouette and elevation view of the proposed tower (or the existing tower, if the applicant is seek-
ing permission to install an antenna on an existing tower) and all other communication facilities, and 
the tower compound, describing colors and materials to be used for the communication facilities 
and any security fence, decorative fence, and decorative wall. The configuration of proposed antenna 
arrays must be shown on the silhouette.  The proposed location of future, additional antenna arrays 
must be shown on the silhouette by dashed lines.  The elevation view shall portray the general con-
text and compatibility of the proposed facilities with respect to surrounding structures and natural 
features. 

F. Copies of any proposed easements, where applicable to the project. 
G. Documentation of the frequency band and wattage of the proposed communication facilities. 
H. For each new monopole, tower, or antenna that is not otherwise located on a co-location site, a writ-

ten report documenting the attempts made by the applicant to secure a suitable co-location site 
both within the city and in the adjoining unincorporated areas and any supporting technical reasons 
supporting the need for a new independent site. 

8.8  Inspection/Fee.  To determine whether tower compounds are in compliance with the require-
ments of this Ordinance, the City shall make, or have made on its behalf, an annual inspection of the 
communication facilities on each tower compound and the walls, fences, and landscaping around each 
tower compound, for which an annual inspection fee of $200.00 shall be imposed.  If more than one an-
tenna is located on a tower, the annual inspection fee shall be $300.00. The fee shall be due on January 
1 of each year and shall be delinquent if not paid by January 31 of such year. To help defray the cost of 
collecting delinquent fees, an additional fee, in the amount equal to ten (10) percent of the fee shall be 
payable for each month, or portion of a month, after January in which the fee remains unpaid. If the fee 
is not paid within three (3) months of its due date, the City may withdraw its permission for the location 
of communication facilities on the tower compound, in which event, all communication facilities must 
be removed from the tower compound within three (3) months of the day on which the owner or owners 
of the tower receive notice of such withdrawal of permission.  The fee shall be payable by, and shall be 
the responsibility of the owner or owners of the tower, even if additional antennas located on the tower 
are owned by other parties. If there is more than one owner of the tower, each owner shall be jointly 
and severally liable for the entire amount of the fee and any additional fees due because of delinquency 
in payment.  Any inspection conducted in accordance with these regulations shall not be relate to the 
safety or structural soundness of the communication facilities or tower.  The purpose of the inspection 
shall be limited to determining whether such communication facilities and tower compound are in com-
pliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.  Any violation of the provisions of the Ordinance that are 
discovered through said inspection shall be processed and resolved in accordance with the procedures 
specified in Article VI, Section 4 of this Ordinance.

8.9  Removal of Obsolete Towers. Any tower that is no longer serving an active communication 
use shall be removed at the owner’s expense.  The owner shall provide the Enforcement Officer with 
a copy of the notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations and remove the tower and all associated 
communication facilities from the site within three (3) months from the date that all operations ceased.  
Where a tower serves as a co-location site, this provision shall not apply until all active users cease oper-
ation. If the owner of the tower fails to remove the tower as required, the responsibility for removal shall 
then apply to the owner of the land upon which the obsolete tower is located. Once the responsibility for 
removal has shifted to the property owner, the property owner shall remove the obsolete tower within 
one (1) month of the date that tower owner’s removal deadline lapsed. If neither the owner of the tower 
nor the owner of the land removes the obsolete tower within the time prescribed herein, the City may, 



62 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
but shall not be obligated to, remove the obsolete tower.  If the City removes the obsolete tower, it shall 
be entitled to recover the cost of removal from the owner of the tower and/or the owner of the land 
upon which the tower is located. 

8.10  Satellite Dishes.  All satellite dishes exceeding one (1) meter in diameter shall be considered 
structures required to be installed in accordance with all applicable provisions of this Ordinance, the 
Standard Building Code, and any other applicable regulations enforced by the City of Alexander City. All 
such dishes shall be located in the rear yard of the property, and shall be set back from all property lines 
a distance equal to the height of the dish. 

8.11  Appeals.  All appeals from a decision by the Enforcement Officer or City Council shall be to the 
Circuit Court or FCC as prescribed by the Telecommunication Act of 1996. 

8.12 Section 6409(a) of the Federal Communications Commission Report. Nothing in this sec-
tion shall be construed to conflict with Section 6409(a) of the Federal Communications Commission Re-
port and Order of 2014, which states that a local government may not deny, and shall approve, any 
eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not 
substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station. The term “eligible facilities 
request” means any request or modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that involves col-
location of new transmission equipment, removal of transmission equipment, or replacement of trans-
mission equipment.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve the FCC from the requirements of the National 
Historic Preservation Act or the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

parked. 

SECTION 10 - CHILD CARE CENTER REQUIREMENTS 

All child care facilities, whether conducted within a home or in a nonresidential building, shall be established 
in compliance with the following requirements. 

10.1  In-Home Child Care Facilities. Any in-home child care facility that was lawfully established 
and licensed by the State of Alabama prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall be allowed to re-
main in operation without further approval from the City (subject to any conditions imposed by the Plan-
ning Commission at the time of approval).  Any new in-home child care facility (serving five [5] or fewer 
children) will only be permitted by the Board of Adjustment as a Special Exception within a residential 
zone (RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3M, and MHP) subject to the applicable requirements of a home occupation, as 
specified in Article IV, Section 4 of this ordinance, and subject to any additional mitigating conditions that 
the Board of Adjustment is authorized to impose under Article VII, Section 5.2 of this ordinance. No signs 
advertising an in-home child care facility shall be located on the property.  An in-home child care facility 
shall be classified as a residential based facility and must satisfy all applicable requirements imposed by 
the State of Alabama Department of Human Resources. 

10.2  Non-Residential Child Care Centers.  Child care centers serving six (6) or more children shall 
not be allowed in any residential zone or residential use building. All such child care centers shall fully 
comply with all requirements of the building code for an educational occupancy. Architectural plans also 
may be required to document compliance.  Any child care center that was lawfully established prior to 
the effective date of this ordinance, but does not comply with the requirements specified herein, shall 
be classified as a pre-existing, nonconforming use, subject to the requirements contained in Article IV, 
Section 1 of this ordinance. Such uses shall be allowed to continue operation as previously permitted, 
only as long as the facility does not increase the number of children it serves and it does not expand the 
area of the facility (both indoors and outdoors) dedicated to child care services. Any such change in the 
intensity of use shall require the issuance of a new zoning permit, and the facility shall fully comply with 
all requirements of this ordinance. 

SECTION 11 - CEMETERIES 

Within all zoning districts that cemeteries are permitted, the following requirements shall apply: 

11.1  The site proposed for a cemetery shall not interfere with the development of a system of streets 
classified as collector or higher in the vicinity of such site. In addition, such site shall have direct access to 
a major street. 

11.2  Any new cemetery shall be located on a site containing not less than 20 acres. 

11.3  All structures shall be set back no less than 25 feet from any property line or minor street right-
of-way. 

11.4  All graves or burial lots shall be set back not less than 25 feet from any property line or minor 
street right-of-way lines, and not less than 50 feet from any collector or arterial street. 

11.5  The entire cemetery property shall be landscaped and maintained. All applications for ceme-
teries must be approved by the Tallapoosa County Health Department.

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
SECTION 12 - STANDARDS FOR TOWNHOUSES, CONDOMINIUMS, AND GARDEN HOMES 

12.1  Townhouses and Condominiums. The design, review, and approval of Townhouse or Condo-
minium development projects within any regular zoning district that such uses may be permitted, shall 
be governed by this guidelines and requirements contained in this section. 

A. Statement of intent. The purpose of this Section is to establish special standards for the design and 
review of development projects containing Townhouse and Condominium dwellings.  It is expect-
ed that Townhouse and Condominium developments will offer a higher standard of amenity than 
a traditional residential subdivision to compensate for the higher residential density opportunities 
afforded by these special development standards.  In addition, the development design flexibility 
created by these standards should be used to protect sensitive natural features within or adjacent to 
the development site, such as rivers and streams, lakes or lake shoreline, rare or endangered species 
colonies or habitats, or large stands or tracts of mature trees or forest areas.  Such natural features or 
resources would be difficult to protect under traditional subdivision practices. Although architectural 
design of individual buildings is not specifically regulated by this Ordinance, the City expects devel-
opers of Townhouse and Condominium projects to design buildings and utilize exterior materials 
and color schemes that will help the project blend with or complement the predominant architec-
tural style of the surrounding neighborhood and to minimize the appearance and intrusion of the 
higher permitted residential densities on the natural environment, neighboring properties, and the 
overall setting of the project. 

B. Basic Development Requirements for all Townhouses and Condominiums. The following basic 
design requirements and dimensional standards shall be incorporated into each Townhouse and 
Condominium development: 
1. Minimum development site area for Townhouse and Condominium projects.  Each lot or 

development site that will be designed to accommodate Townhouse or Condominium dwelling 
units and buildings shall contain not less than five (5) acres within an RR, Reserve Residential Zone 
or R-1, Low Density Residential Zone and not less than two and one half (2.5) acres in any other 
permitted zoning district.  At least seventy-five (75) percent of the land area contained within the 
entire development site shall consist of developable land area. 

2. Maximum number of dwelling units.  The maximum number of Townhouse and/or Condomini-
um dwelling units that may be constructed on any given acre of land contained with the de-
velopment site shall not exceed the number specified below, unless approved by the Planning 
Commission in accordance with the density bonus provisions of Section 13.1, Subparagraph C: 
RR, Reserve Residential Zone: Ten (10) units. R-1, Low Density Residential Zone: Twelve (12) units. 
All other zones:     Eighteen (18) units. 

3. Maximum and minimum number of dwelling units allowed in a single building.  No town-
house or condominium building shall contain fewer than four (4) nor more than twelve (12) inde-
pendent dwelling units. 

4. Maximum percentage of development site covered by impervious surfaces. The maximum 
percentage of an entire development site that may be covered by impervious surfaces at project 
build-out shall not exceed fifty (50) percent in the RR or R-1 zone or sixty (60) percent in all other 
zoning districts, unless approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with the density 
bonus provisions of Section 13.1, Subparagraph C. 

5. Common lands required.   All areas of Townhouse or Condominium development site that are 
not divided into Townhouse lots, condominium buildings, or dedicated public street rights-of way 
shall be dedicated for development and perpetual maintenance as common lands, subject to the 
requirements contained in Article IV, Section 10 of this Ordinance.  Common lands may be used 
for parking, driveways, recreation, stormwater management, and buffers.  At least twenty-five 
(25) percent of the common lands shall be dedicated to either passive or active recreational uses, 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     65

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
and at least forty (40) percent of said common recreational lands shall consist of developable land 
area. Recreational improvements shall be designed to cater to the target market population of the 
development. 

6. Setback from dedicated street rights-of-way. All buildings containing townhouse or condo-
minium units shall be comply with the applicable minimum front yard setback for the regular 
zoning district within which it will be located, but in no case shall a townhouse or condominium 
building be set back more than thirty-five (35) feet from a dedicated street right-of¬way line. 

7. Separation between buildings.  On any townhouse or condominium development site, individ-
ual buildings or complexes of attached and semi-detached units shall be spaced according to the 
following guidelines:
a. Not less than forty (40) feet between the front facade (where the main entrances to the build-

ing or units are located) of a building and any other opposing building facade, or between the 
back facades of opposing buildings.

b. Not less than twenty (20) feet between the side facades of two neighboring buildings.
8. Minimum floor area for each dwelling unit. For one story dwellings, one thousand (1,000) 

square feet per unit. For two story dwellings, one thousand one hundred (1,100) square feet per 
unit with a minimum of five hundred fifty (550) square feet on the first floor.

9. Dimensional requirements for Townhouse development lots. All individual lots in a devel-
opment containing townhouse units (including any lots containing single family attached or 
semi-detached units) shall comply with the following requirements.  These requirements shall 
not apply to condominium structures or developments.
a. Minimum required lot area for each Townhouse unit. One thousand, two hundred fifty (1,250) 

square feet. 
b. Minimum required lot width. Twenty (20) feet. 
c. Minimum required front and rear yards. Two and one half (2.5) feet. 
d. Minimum required side yards. None. 
e. Maximum percentage of lot covered by impervious surfaces. Ninety-six (96) percent. 
f. Minimum separation distance between Townhouse lot and street right-of-way line. No por-

tion of a lot containing a townhouse unit shall be located within twenty-five (25) feet of a 
dedicated street right-of-way line. 

10. Off-street parking requirements. All townhouse lots shall contain adequate parking for a single 
family residential use, as specified in Article IV, Section 5 of this Ordinance. Each building contain-
ing condominium units shall contain an off-street parking lot providing the number of spaces 
required for a multi-family building, as specified in Article IV, Section 5 of this Ordinance.

11. Maximum height. No buildings or structures subject to height restrictions within a Townhouse 
or Condominium development shall exceed twenty-five (25) feet or two and one half (2.5) stories. 

12. Minimum roof pitch.  All Townhouse buildings shall have a minimum roof pitch of 3:12. No min-
imum roof pitch shall apply to Condominium buildings 

13. Required buffers.  All Townhouse and Condominium developments shall be effectively buffered 
and attractively landscaped along the exterior boundaries of the development site.  All buffer 
areas shall be owned and maintained as common open space within each development.  Each 
buffer area shall be dedicated and improved (at a minimum) in accordance with the description 
of a buffer in Article II (Definitions) of this Ordinance. 

14. Required infrastructure.  All proposed Townhouse and Condominium buildings shall be served 
by municipal water, sewer, and natural gas. 

15. Household rubbish containers. Each townhouse and condominium development shall provide 
adequate on-site containers for the collection of household garbage generated by the residents 
of the development.  All garbage containers shall be placed and kept within three- or four-sided 
enclosures with walls at least four (4) feet high to provide proper screening of the containers. 

16. Fire suppression facilities.  Every townhouse and condominium development shall be served or 



66 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
equipped at all times with fire hydrant equipment in good working order, of such type, size, and 
number and so located within the development as to satisfy applicable regulations of the City. 
Each dwelling unit in a townhouse or condominium development shall be located not more than 
one thousand (1,000) feet away from a fire hydrant. No open fires, except barbecue grills, shall be 
permitted within a townhouse or condominium development.  All townhouse and condominium 
developments shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Alexander City Fire Department. 

17. Resident manager. At least one dwelling unit in each townhouse or condominium development 
containing twenty (20) or more dwelling units shall be designated or reserved for a paid or volun-
teer resident manager, who shall represent the development owner or homeowner’s association 
and shall be responsible for ensuring proper maintenance of all facilities and improvements in 
the development.  Where a townhouse or condominium development contains sixty (60) or more 
dwelling units, the required resident manager unit may be improved and utilized as an adminis-
trative office for the development. 

C. Review and approval.  Since both Townhouse and Condominium developments result in the subdi-
vision of land into parcels or units for sale or transfer of ownership, they must be approved as subdi-
visions.  Therefore, all Townhouse and Condominium developments must be reviewed and approved 
by the Planning Commission in accordance with the review and approval procedures of the Alex-
ander City Subdivision Regulations, prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.  To the extent that the 
development standards and/or review considerations of this Section conflict with the corresponding 
requirements of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations (as they may be applied to Townhouse or 
Condominium projects), the requirements contained in this Ordinance shall supercede and govern. 
All other procedures and requirements of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations shall apply. 
During its review of a Townhouse or Condominium development, the Planning Commission shall 
evaluate the following review considerations, and may issue such conditions of approval as may be 
reasonably necessary to correct specific design deficiencies under these considerations.\
1. The consistency of the proposed development scheme with the Comprehensive Plan. 
2. The traffic impacts of the proposed development on adjoining public streets in terms of access 

and circulation and congestion on neighborhood streets. 
3. The extent to which the layout and design of the development will retain and protect sensitive 

and enhancing natural features of the site that would otherwise be lost under a traditional sub-
division design. 

4. The extent to which the architectural design and style of the buildings will complement the pre-
dominant architectural styles present in the surrounding neighborhood. All townhouse and con-
dominium buildings within a development should be designed and/or painted to be aestheti-
cally compatible with each other.  Where the building exteriors or trim are to be painted, earth 
tones shall be preferred. To the greatest extent feasible, all townhouse and condominium build-
ings should be designed to be compatible with or reflective of the predominant architectural 
style(s) represented in the neighborhood surrounding the development site (if the neighborhood 
is clearly characterized by a particular architectural style). 

5. The extent to which the proposed buildings will be designed and oriented to take advantage of 
scenic views and or to maximize solar access. 

6. The extent to which the higher development densities on the site are visually screened from any 
adjoining properties developed for traditional single family detached homes. 

7. The extent to which recreational improvements and amenities, designed to serve the target mar-
ket population for the project, will be incorporated into the common open space within the de-
velopment.  As an additional incentive to advance the provision of recreational improvements 
within a Townhouse or Condominium development, the Planning Commission may authorize the 
developer to construct an additional four (4) dwelling units or lots per acre over and above the 
maximum number of units allowed in Subparagraph B above and an increase of not more than 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     67

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
twenty (20) percent in the maximum percentage of impervious surfaces for Townhouse develop-
ments or thirty (30) percent for Condominium developments in exchange for the provision of any 
two of the following recreational amenities, as may be appropriate for the specific development: 
a. An outdoor, in-ground, Olympic-size swimming pool with a diving platform. 
b. A children’s playground area with not less than three play stations offering a range of play 

activities. 
c. A walking trail around the development with not less than six (6) exercise stations. 
d. A common boat launch facility and dock. 
e. A hard surface tennis facility providing not less than two (2) separate courts. 
f. A central clubhouse building designed for social events or gatherings. 
g. Improved sidewalks, not less than four (4) feet in width connecting all residential buildings, 

common recreational facilities, and (where available) public sidewalk facilities adjoining the 
development site. 

12.2  Garden Home Subdivisions.  For the purposes of this Ordinance, a Garden Home shall be 
defined as a single or two family detached dwelling unit (excluding manufactured homes) designed and 
sited on a lot to maximize rear yard or rear and side yard access and utility, through the construction of an 
exterior patio or first floor deck, rear patio doors, large rear and/or side windows, and the incorporation 
of intensive ornamental landscaping (which may include ornamental fencing) surrounding the exterior 
patio/deck to enhance rear/side yard privacy and visual appeal. Garden homes are designed to create 
a high value single family residential environment in a high density setting.  All garden home develop-
ments shall comply with the following requirements:

A. Residential dwelling types permitted.  Single family dwellings, excluding manufactured homes. 
B. Infrastructure requirements.  All garden homes shall be served by municipal water, sewer, and gas. 
C. Siting.  Garden home structures shall be sited as close as possible to the front setback line and one of 

the side yard setback lines to maximize utility of the remaining rear and opposing side yard for patio/
garden development.  Such units may be designed as a zero lot line development in accordance with 
the provisions of Article IV, Section 14 of this Ordinance. 

D. Accessory structures.  No accessory structures shall be permitted on a garden home lot.  Exterior stor-
age units and garages must be attached to the dwelling unit. 

E. Landscaping.  Intensive ornamental landscaping shall be provided in the rear and side yard of all 
garden homes to ensure visual privacy and to create an attractive garden environment.  Ornamental 
walls not taller than four (4) feet in height and terraces may be incorporated into the landscaping 
scheme to provide additional privacy and visual interest. 

F. Windows.  Windows within garden homes shall be designed to favor (in terms of size, number, or 
both) views of the landscaped rear and/or side yards of the property. 

G. Special infill development incentives for garden home subdivisions. The City of Alexander City desires 
to encourage high quality infill residential development within the developed core of the City.  Infill 
development promotes efficient growth by utilizing existing infrastructure and breathing new life 
into established neighborhoods, thereby stabilizing property values and strengthening established 
neighborhoods. To help encourage quality infill residential development, the City has developed the 
following development incentives or intensity bonuses for any garden home subdivision in areas of 
the City identified by the Alexander City Comprehensive Plan as “potential infill residential develop-
ment sites.”  These areas have been identified by the Planning Commission as desired locations for the 
development or redevelopment of high-value urban residential environments, where supporting in-
frastructure and community services are available and accessible. Any applicant that either develops 
or rezones and develops an area identified in the Comprehensive Plan as a “potential infill residential 
development site” in accordance with the garden home subdivision provisions of this Ordinance, 
shall be entitled to develop the site in accordance with the modified dimensional requirements listed 



68 

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
below.  All other dimensional requirements imposed by the applicable zoning district that are not 
otherwise modified by the standards listed below shall be applied as specified in that district. 
1. Modified Minimum Lot Size: Six thousand (6,000) square feet for each lot designed to accommo-

date a single family detached dwelling. 
2. Modified Front Yard Setback: Twenty (20) feet. An additional setback may be required under the 

conditions specified in Article III, Section 7 of this Ordinance. 
3. Modified Minimum Lot Width: Sixty (60) feet for each lot designed to accommodate a single fam-

ily detached dwelling.  All lots must comply with the minimum lot width to length ratio specified 
in Article III, Section 

4. Minimum Side Yard Setbacks: Five feet (5) feet. 
5. Minimum Rear Yard Setback: Twenty-five (25) feet. 
6. Modified Maximum Impervious Surface Area: Fifty (50) percent. 

SECTION 13 - ZERO LOT LINE DEVELOPMENTS

A zero lot line development is a single family subdivision within which the standard side yard setback require-
ments are modified to allow the individual dwelling units to be sited along one side yard lot line with a corre-
sponding increase in the opposing side yard. The modified setback requirements authorized by this Section 
of the Zoning Ordinance must be approved by the Planning Commission as part of a preliminary subdivision 
plan for the proposed zero lot line development.  The Zero Lot Line concept may be applied to any residential 
subdivision in the RR, R-1, R-2, and R-3 residential zoning districts. All zero lot line developments shall comply 
with the following requirements:

13.1  Zero lot line zoning modifications allowed only for subdivisions. The zoning modifications 
stipulated in this Section for zero lot line developments shall be approved only for a subdivision that sat-
isfies all special requirements for zero lot line developments.  No zero lot line zoning modifications shall 
be authorized for an individual dwelling building lot that is not part of a zero lot line subdivision plat 
approved by the Planning Commission. 

13.2  Infrastructure requirements.  All dwelling units in a zero lot line development shall be served 
by municipal water, sewer, and gas. 

13.3  Residential dwelling types permitted.  Any single family dwelling, including garden homes, 
but excluding manufactured homes, shall be permitted within a zero lot line development, as long as the 
proposed units satisfy all applicable dimensional requirements of this zoning district. 

13.4  Minimum size of a zero lot line development site.  All zero lot line development sites shall 
contain not less than three (3) acres. At least eighty (80) percent of the development site shall consist of 
developable land area. 

13.5  Side yard setback modification.  Within any zero lot line subdivision approved by the Plan-
ning Commission, the minimum side yard setback on one side of each lot shall be reduced to one (1) foot, 
resulting in a corresponding increase in the minimum side yard setback requirement for the opposing 
side yard on the lot.  In no instance shall a reduced side yard on one lot abut a reduced side yard on an 
adjoining lot. One exterior wall of each dwelling unit constructed on a zero lot line property shall be sited 
along the reduced side yard setback. 

13.6  Maintenance easement required.  For each zero lot line property, a permanently dedicated 
four (4) foot wide maintenance easement shall be imposed on the side yard of the adjoining property 
that abuts a zero side yard, to allow the zero lot line property owner adequate access to the neighboring 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     69

Article IV: Special Use Provisions
property to maintain the exterior wall of the dwelling along the zero lot line. The easement shall prohibit 
the construction of any fence, landscaping, or other access obstruction with the required maintenance 
easement. 

13.7  No windows or doors allowed along the zero side yard. No exterior windows or doors shall 
be permitted along any dwelling wall that is located along a zero side yard. 

13.8  Consistency within blocks.  Side yard setbacks shall not be modified for an individual lot, un-
less it is part of a block within the development in which all lots will possess zero side yards. 

13.9  Common open space and recreation improvements.  All commonly owned lands shall be 
subject to the Common Open Space Requirements specified in Article IV, Section 10 of this Ordinance. 
All zero lot line developments containing fifty (50) or more dwelling units shall provide one or more 
improved outdoor recreational area(s) for the tenants of the development utilizing not less than ten 
(10) percent of the gross development site area.  At least half of the land dedicated to such recreational 
improvements shall be developable land area, and the recreational area or areas must be afforded public 
access from every dwelling unit in the development.  Recreational improvements shall be designed to 
serve the specific recreational needs of the target population for the development (if the development 
has been designed to serve a specific market segment of the population), and may include: 
A. A hard surface walking trail with exercise stations. 
B. A swimming pool facility. 
C. Tennis/basketball courts. 
D. Athletic fields (but no bleachers or stands). 
E. A playground with playground equipment. 
F. A recreational lake with at least one of the following facilities: a community boat launch, fishing pier, 

and/or a beach. The improvement of an existing water amenity adjacent to or within the develop-
ment shall satisfy this recreational option. 

G. A community picnic area with picnic tables, barbecue stations, and/or pavilions. 
H. A skateboard track. 
I. A perpetually maintained ornamental garden with walking paths and a gazebo. 
J. Golf putting greens or a miniature golf course. 

13.10  Buffer requirements.  A landscaped and perpetually maintained buffer shall be provided 
along any property line of a zero lot line development that adjoins a property zoned RR, R-1, R-2, B-2, 
B-3, I-1, I-2, or MHP and along any road classified as an arterial or collector highway in the Alexander City 
Comprehensive Plan.

SECTION 14 - LIVESTOCK PROVISIONS

See Sec. 10-20 through 10-23 of the Code of Alexander City for regulations regarding livestock within the City 
limits. All permitted livestock enclosures shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet from any adjoining residential 
property line and all livestock shall be kept within such enclosures. Enclosures are defined as structures for the 
containment of livestock, but do not include fences.

SECTION 2 - ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES

The boundaries of the various zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the Zoning Map. The Zon-
ing Map includes a base map which identifies the location of the regular districts and an overlay to the base 
map which outlines the boundaries of the special districts.  The Zoning Map and all explanatory matter there-
on accompany and are hereby made a part of this Ordinance by reference. Official copies of the Zoning Map 
shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk.

SECTION 3 - INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES 

Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps, the following rules shall 
apply:

3.1  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following jurisdictional limits or platted lot 
lines or other property lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 

3.2  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or rail-
roads, such boundaries shall be construed to follow the center lines of such streets, alleys, rights-of-way, 
or railroads. 

3.3  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following shorelines of lakes or ponds, such 
boundaries shall be construed to follow the mean high water lines of such lakes or ponds. In the event of 
a change in the mean high waterline, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the actual mean 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     71

Article V: Zoning District Requirements
high waterline. 

3.4  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following streams, rivers, or other perennial 
water courses, such boundaries shall be construed to follow the centerline of such waterways as deter-
mined by the mean high water mark along opposing banks.  In the event of a natural change in the loca-
tion of such waterways, the district boundary shall be construed as moving with the centerline. 

3.5  Where boundaries are indicated as being separate from but approximately parallel to any fea-
tures listed in Subparagraphs 3.1 through 3.4 of this Section, such boundaries shall be construed as being 
parallel to and at such distance as indicated on the Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimension 
shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map. 

3.6  Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the district requirements for 
the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such 
extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line. 

3.7  Where a public road, street, or alley shown on the Zoning Map is officially vacated or aban-
doned, the regulations applicable to the property to which the right-of-way reverts shall apply to the 
vacated or abandoned road, street, or alley. 

3.8  In case any further uncertainty exists, the Board of Adjustment shall determine the location of 
boundaries. The Board of Adjustment may also cause to be prepared sectional maps of any part of the 
City which will interpret the exact location of the district boundaries, following the guidelines contained 
in the preceding paragraphs. 

SECTION 4 - INTERPRETATION OF USES 

Where doubt exists as to whether a new or previously unclassified use is similar in nature to the permitted 
uses identified in this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall approve or deny the location of the unclas-
sified use in question. In making such a determination, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the extent to 
which the proposed use is consistent with the intent of the zoning district and determine the specific permit-
ted use within the zoning district that is most similar in impact and characteristics to the proposed new use.  
However, in no instance shall the Board of Adjustment interpret a proposed use as being permitted in one 
district, when the use is more similar in impact and characteristics to a use permitted in another district.  The 
following procedures to establish consistency of unclassified uses shall be observed. 

4.1  Determination by Board of Adjustment. If compatible with the existing zoning district in-
tent, the unclassified use shall be permitted by special exception upon approval of and subject to the 
conditions set by the Board of Adjustment.  Such conditions of approval shall be established to prevent 
undue impacts of the new use on surrounding uses, and shall be limited to:

A. Special setback requirements (to alleviate potential use conflicts, to provide safe isolation distances, 
or to facilitate traffic access and mobility); 

B. Special buffer, landscaping, or fencing requirements (to screen potentially conflicting uses); 
C. Special lighting or light shielding requirements (to prevent excessive glare on neighboring proper-

ties); 
D. Special parking requirements (to address special traffic or parking needs); 
E. Special limitations on signage (to enhance or soften the appearance of the proposed use); 
F. Special limitations on traffic access points to the property (to prevent traffic congestion and promote 

proper traffic circulation); 



72

SECTION 5 - RR: RESERVE RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT

5.1  District Intent.  Within Alexander City, extensive rural areas exist on the outskirts of the es-
tablished neighborhoods and urbanized areas. These rural areas are characterized by a mix of open 
space uses, including small farms and forested lands, and low intensity developed uses. Where munic-
ipal infrastructure has been extended into these areas, pockets of suburban residential development 
have emerged.  However, where minimal infrastructure is available, development intensities are gen-
erally constrained by natural resources and constraints. The primary purpose of this district is to allow 
existing rural land use patterns, including agriculture and forestry, to continue until the City extends the 
municipal infrastructure necessary to support more intensive development.  In areas where such infra-
structure is provided, this district shall afford opportunities for low density residential development to 
emerge, thereby allowing opportunities for the managed growth and expansion of the City. To that end, 
this district shall act as a reserve district to maintain existing rural land uses until such time as the City 
is prepared for expansion.  Minimum standards for all uses shall be imposed to ensure compatibility of 
uses within the context of a low intensity pattern of mixed uses.  These standards should promote low 
intensity development patterns, consistent with the availability of municipal infrastructure, to help pro-
tect existing natural resources and to minimize the impact of future growth on the municipal tax base, 
thereby avoiding scattered and premature development. 

5.2  Permitted Uses.  The following uses shall be permitted in the RR - Reserve Residential Zoning 
District. 

A. Single family detached dwellings. 
B. Single family attached and semi-detached dwellings, including condominiums and townhouses, in 

accordance with Article IV, Section 13 of this Ordinance. 
C. Accessory residential dwelling units in compliance with all requirements specified in Article IV, Sec-

SECTION 18 - FH: FLOOD HAZARD AREA ZONE 

18.1  District Intent.   Within floodplain areas, special land use restrictions are desired to: minimize 
human exposure to flood hazards, prevent excessive pollution or contamination of surface water re-
sources and flooded properties during floods,  provide maximum transmission and absorption of flood 
waters by restricting the intensity of impervious surfaces and man-made obstructions within floodplains, 
ensure that structures built within floodplains are properly floodproofed, to minimize private investment 
losses due to flooding, and ensure the City’s continued participation in the National Flood Insurance 
Program.  The purpose of this “overlay zone” is to impose special development standards and restrictions 
in areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as subject to special flood hazard to 
serve the aforementioned objectives.  An “overlay zone” imposes special development requirements and 
restrictions in addition to the provisions of the underlying regular zoning district. Where the require-
ments of this district conflict with the requirements of an underlying regular zoning district or with other 
applicable ordinances and regulations, the more restrictive requirements shall be followed.  All land use 
and development activities on lands within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone shall also comply with all 
requirements of the City of Alexander City Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. 

18.2  Boundaries.  The boundaries of the Flood Hazard Area Zone shall encompass all areas of Alex-
ander City lying within a Special Flood Hazard Area or 100-year floodplain, as shown on the latest pub-
lished Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map for the subject property, prepared for 
the National Flood Insurance Program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

18.3  Prohibited Uses. The following uses shall be prohibited within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone. 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     107

Article V: Zoning District Requirements
A. On-site septic system leach fields and temporary sewage holding tanks. 
B. Open air storage or holding pits, bunkers, or ponds for the storage of animal manure or wastes. 
C. Sanitary landfills and other solid waste facilities. 
D. Junkyards. 
E. Animal corrals, stockyards, and poultry houses. 
F. Multi-family residential structures. 
G. Mini-warehouse facilities. 
H. Group homes, nursing homes, and other congregate care facilities. 
I. Public and private schools or educational buildings. 
J. Hotels, motels, and boarding houses. 
K. Warehouse facilities used for the storage of hazardous waste or materials. 
L. Residential uses not otherwise prohibited within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone shall not be permit-

ted within the floodway, nor shall any such residential structure encroach upon the floodway. 

18.4  Dimensional Requirements: 

A. Development activities and land uses within the FH: Flood Hazard Area Zone shall comply with all re-
quirements contained in the City of Alexander City Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance in addition 
to the specific requirements contained in this Zoning Ordinance. 

B. Maximum Percentage of Lot Covered by Impervious Surfaces:   Twenty (20) percent, or the maximum 
permitted by the underlying regular zoning district, if such maximum is less. 

SECTION 19 - PD: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT 

19.1  District Intent.  The purpose of the PD - Planned Development district is to encourage the de-
velopment of innovative and creative land use designs in a mixed use environment.  The district is intend-
ed to allow the unified planning and development of large tracts of land suitable in location, area, and 
character for the uses and structure proposed. A mix of uses and housing types is encouraged, provided 
that the proposed project is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the land uses proposed along 
the external boundaries of the development site will be compatible in intensity, character, and design 
with the neighboring uses. 

19.2  Permitted Uses. Any uses allowed in the RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, and B-1 zoning districts shall be 
permitted, provided that the uses are laid out and buffered to minimize potential noise, traffic, and aes-
thetic conflicts and the overall development scheme is consistent with the goals, objectives, and future 
land use map contained in the Comprehensive Plan.  Proposed land uses along the boundaries of the 
development site shall be compatible in intensity, character, and design with the land uses allowed in the 
immediately adjoining regular zoning district(s). All proposed land uses shall be shown and designated 
clearly on the master plan of the development. 

19.3 Design Requirements and Considerations. In order to change the regular district designation 
of a tract of land to PD - Planned Development, and subsequently thereby use such as tract of land, the 
following conditions shall be met: 

A. A master plan of development showing the exact manner in which the whole tact will be improved 
and used must accompany the request for change of zoning.  Said master plan must be approved 
by the City Council after review and recommendation by the Planning Commission, and must be re-
tained in the file of the City Clerk as a part of the city’s records. The required master plan shall contain, 
at a minimum, the following information: 



108

description and a current perimeter survey prepared and certified by a surveyor who is licensed 
by the State of Alabama.  The survey must show all streets and street rights-of-way which are 
adjacent to the parcel, all easements and rights-of-way on the development site, the boundary 
lines of any and all lots of record that comprise the entire development site, and the locations of 
any existing buildings or structures which shall be incorporated into the proposed development. 

2. A vicinity map showing the parcel in relation to surrounding property and a general description 
of the surrounding area, including the current zoning and land uses of all adjoining lands. 

3. A statement of the planning objectives to be achieved by the proposed development.  The state-
ment should include a description of the proposed development and the rationale behind the 
assumptions and projections made by the applicant. 

4. The density of land use to be allocated to all parts of the development site, together with tabu-
lations by acreage and percentage of the parcel to be occupied by each proposed use to show 
compliance with all applicable dimensional requirements. 

5. The location, size, and character of any common open space or any commonly owned facilities 
and the type of organization which will own and maintain any commonly owned open space or 
facilities.  Such explanation shall document the applicant’s intent to comply with all requirements 
for common open space, as specified in Article IV, Section 10 of this Ordinance. 

6. The number, location, and layout of parking spaces and attendant driveways, handicap parking 
areas, off-street loading and unloading areas, and emergency vehicle parking areas as may be 
required of the proposed development under Article IV, Section 5 of this Ordinance.  Information 
regarding the type, thickness, and imperviousness of surfacing materials to be used to improve 
all parking areas, driveways, and pedestrian ways shall also be provided. 

7. The location, design, and dimensions of all proposed curb cuts that will provide access to the site 
and all proposed temporary cul-de-sacs that will be constructed to reserve future street access to 
abutting undeveloped properties. 

8. A landscaping plan, which shall show all proposed improvements to required buffers and other 
common open space lands, including the location of existing mature tree stands that will be re-
tained and incorporated into the overall development plan. 

9. Typical facade sketches of the outside appearance of any proposed commercial buildings, town-
house and condominium buildings, and multi¬family dwellings.  The architectural style and de-
sign of such buildings should be compatible, if not reflective of a common design theme that is 
generally compatible or complementary of (and, at a minimum, not inconsistent with) the pre-
dominant architectural styles in any established areas or neighborhoods surrounding the devel-
opment site. 

10. Detailed dimensional plans for any and all proposed signs within the development in compliance 
with the applicable requirements of Article IV, Section 7 of this Ordinance. 

11. A detailed stormwater management plan showing the location(s) of all 100¬year floodplains on

shall include the master plan of development.  Where any information required by Subparagraph A of 
this Section to be included in the master plan of development would also be required to be included 
in a required preliminary plat, reference on the preliminary plat to the specific portions or pages of 
the master plan of development containing said information shall be sufficient to satisfy the corre-
sponding preliminary plat content requirements of the Subdivision Regulations.  No permit of any 
type shall be issued for any use, activity, building, or site improvement that is not in accordance with 
the approved and recorded master plan of development. 

C. The master plan of development for a tract may be amended at any time by the City Council, upon 
the recommendation of the Planning Commission, provided a notice is given and a public hearing 
held thereon in the same manner as for the original approval of the change of zoning for the subject 
tract to a PD zoning district classification. 

D. Landscaping and open space shall be essential part of the master plan.  At least twenty-five (25) 
percent of the gross area shall be dedicated to open space/recreational uses (such as landscaping, 
bike paths, walkways [with or without exercise stations], swimming areas, and recreational courts).  
At least half of the required open space area shall consist of developable land area. Existing trees and 
natural features shall be preserved wherever possible. Said open spaces shall be integrated into the 
overall development design (not relegated to a corner of the site) to provide maximum access to the 
residents and workers of the development.  At no point shall an open space area be less than twenty 
(20) feet in width. 

E. Insofar as possible, vehicular traffic shall be separated from pedestrian traffic.  Sidewalks should be 
provided along all internal streets providing through traffic access and between all residential and 
non-residential use areas within the development. 

F. The vehicular traffic generated by the proposed development shall not exceed the capacity of access 
streets, and shall not disrupt established residential areas. 

G. The capacity of existing or scheduled public utility systems, streets, or schools to serve the potential 
number of families, businesses, and workers in the proposed development shall be considered during 
the review and approval process. The City of Alexander City may deny a proposed PD master plan or 
require phasing of the project as may be needed to avoid public facility capacity shortfalls caused by 
a premature development project.  Each PD master plan shall include letters from the Superintendent 
of Education, the Fire Chief, the Police Chief, the Street/Sanitation Superintendent, and the Parks and 
Recreation Director confirming that they have considered the scale of the proposed development 
and have determined that it will not exceed the capacity of the specific public facilities and services 
within their authority to serve the needs of the proposed development and the community at large.  
Where such finding cannot be made by the aforementioned officials, the letter shall state, to the best 
of the official’s knowledge, the nature of any potential infrastructure or service deficiencies and the 
prospective date by which the City can address the deficiencies, if specific improvements have been 
planned or envisioned. 

H. Every effort shall be made to maximize energy efficiency.  Energy conservation measures which 
should be employed include: 
1. orienting buildings to maximize solar access, 
2. utilization of landscape design techniques and species that maximize protection from excess heat 

in the summer and allow solar exposure in the winter, 
3. minimizing the amount of roads and streets needed to serve the development, 
4. utilizing “green” site design to minimize thermal stress on surface waters from stormwater runoff 

and to minimize potential storage and release of excess heat from impervious surfaces, and 
5. dedication of areas for community gardens.

I. Every Planned Development shall include management agreement provisions for the control and 
maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership as prescribed in Article 



110 

Article V: Zoning District Requirements
IV, Section 10.4 of this Ordinance. 

J. Access shall be provided to each separately platted building site by way of a publicity dedicated 
street plus a driveway or clearway of at least ten (10) feet in width for residential uses, and twelve (12) 
feet in width for nonresidential uses. 

K. Each Planned Development shall satisfy the off-street parking and loading space requirements for 
the specific proposed land uses as specified in Article IV, Section 5 of this Ordinance. 

19.4  Dimensional Requirements:

A. Minimum Planned Development Site Size:  The minimum size of the Planned Development site 
shall be five (5) acres.  Not less than eighty (80) percent of the gross land area of the proposed devel-
opment site shall consist of developable land area. 

B. Minimum Lot Size Within a Planned Development: No minimum building site is required, provid-
ed that the land used for building coverage and off-street parking and loading spaces as required 
in Article IV, Section 5, does not preclude adequate open spaces for landscaping, and for recreation 
facilities for the occupants of dwellings. The proposed minimum and average building sites, the re-
sulting average net density (families per acre of residential land use), the total land used for every 
purpose (including right-of-way), the number of off-street parking and loading spaces for each use 
area, and the total and average land area covered by the building in each use area, shall be calculated 
and shown on the master plan of development.  Specific minimum lot sizes may be imposed by the 
Tallapoosa County Health Department for proper siting and installation of on-site sewage disposal 
facilities, where municipal sewer access is not available. 

C. Minimum Building Setback Line: 
1. Thirty (30) feet from the edge of the right-of-way line.  An additional setback may be required 

under the conditions specified in Article III, Section 7 of this Ordinance. 
2. For any lot with frontage along a street classified as a collector in the Comprehensive Plan, all 

structures shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from the centerline of the collector street. 
3. For any lot with frontage along a street classified as an arterial in the Comprehensive Plan, all 

structures shall be set back at least eighty (80) feet from the centerline of the arterial street. 
D. Minimum Yards: No building shall be closer than fifteen (15) feet to any PD zoning boundary line, 

providing that no entrance of any building shall be closer than twenty-five (25) feet to any such line. 
E. Minimum Spacing Between Buildings: For dwellings, the open space between buildings shall not 

be less than ten (10) feet for one story buildings, twenty (20) feet when either building is a two story 
building, thirty (30) feet when either building is a three story building and forty (40) feet plus an addi-
tional ten (10) feet for each story over three stories when either building is over three stories in height. 
The minimum dimension of the yard upon which any entrance or exit of a dwelling faces shall be ten 
(10) feet; such space shall not be counted as a yard for any other building. 

F. Maximum Structure Height: Forty-five (45) feet. 
G. Maximum Percentage Of Site Covered By Impervious Surfaces: Forty (40) percent of gross area of 

Planned Development site area.  Fifty (50) percent for any individual lot within the Planned Develop-
ment. 

19.5  General Review and Approval Procedures.  The potential complexity of a Planned Develop-
ment demands an extensive review and approval process.  To help ensure a smooth and efficient admin-
istrative process, the following steps shall be observed: 

A. Preliminary Conceptual Review.  Prior to submission of a formal rezoning petition for a proposed 
Planned Development, the applicant or developer shall meet informally with the Enforcement Officer 
to discuss the development concept and to ensure that the applicant procedures and requirements 
are understood. Such review shall not require detailed plan specifications, but any sketch plans pre-



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     111

Article V: Zoning District Requirements
pared shall be sufficient to clearly convey the overall design scheme, the intended land uses, and 
the overall intensity of development that will be proposed. A preliminary conceptual review shall be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions for a pre-application conference as specified in Article 
V, Sections 2 and 3 of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations. 

B. Rezoning Petition.  After a preliminary conceptual review has been conducted, the applicant or 
developer may submit a formal petition for rezoning to the Planning Commission.  Said petition shall 
be accompanied by a master plan for development as required by Section 19.3, Subparagraph A of 
this Article.  Review and approval of the rezoning petition and master plan of development shall be 
conducted concurrently in accordance with the procedures specified in Article VIII of this Ordinance. 
Approval by the City Council of a rezoning petition and master plan of development shall not autho-
rize construction of the proposed development, if approval of a subdivision plan is required. 

C. Subdivision Approval.  Once a petition for rezoning and the master plan for development has been 
approved by the City Council, the applicant or developer may proceed with the preparation, submis-
sion, and approval of a preliminary subdivision plat for the proposed development.  Such preliminary 
plat submission, review, and approval shall be conducted by the Planning Commission in accordance 
with the procedures and requirements specified in Article V, Sections 2 and 4 of the Alexander City 
Subdivision Regulations. 

D. Expedited and Consolidated Planning Commission Review Procedures. To help minimize the im-
pact of a complicated review process, the City of Alexander City shall make provisions for an expe-
dited and consolidated review process by the Planning Commission.  If requested in writing by the 
applicant or developer and approved by the City Council prior to submission of a formal rezoning pe-
tition, special provisions for the Planning Commission’s review of the rezoning petition, master plan 
of development, and preliminary subdivision plat to be conducted simultaneously and in accordance 
with the review procedures for a Preliminary Plat  under Article V of the Alexander City Subdivision 
Regulations may be allowed.  Such approval by the City Council shall specifically waive the 30 day re-
porting deadline for the Planning Commission’s decision regarding the rezoning petition as specified 
in Article VIII, Section 4 of this Ordinance.  Such a waiver is necessary to permit the longer review time 
that may be required for the joint review of a Preliminary Plat, the master plan of development, and 
the rezoning petition. If an expedited and combined review is requested by the applicant or devel-
oper and approved by the City Council in accordance with this provision, the Planning Commission’s 
review and public hearing process shall be conducted in accordance with the Preliminary Plat review 
procedures specified in Article V, Sections 2 and 4 of the Alexander City Subdivision Regulations. 
However, construction work on the proposed development in accordance with the approved pre-
liminary subdivision plat shall not occur unless and until the City Council has approved the required 
rezoning petition and master plan of development, and the Planning Commission shall condition any 
approval of the preliminary plat on said rezoning approval by the City Council.

Article VI: Administrative and Enforcement Guidelines
ARTICLE VI: ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT GUIDELINES 

SECTION 1 - ZONING PERMIT REQUIRED 

No excavation, construction, renovation (except painting, wallpapering, and repairs that do not require chang-
es to the character or use of the structure and are do not require the issuance of a building permit), recon-
struction, or other development activity governed by this Ordinance shall be conducted prior to the issuance 
of a Zoning Permit by the Enforcement Officer.  It shall be unlawful for the building official to approve any 
plans or issue a building permit for any such excavation or construction, until he has submitted such plans in 
detail to the Enforcement Officer and a Zoning Permit has been issued.  The issuance of a Zoning Permit shall 
not constitute approval of any required building permit or other permit that may be required. 

SECTION 2 - GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 

2.1  Enforcement Officer.  The provisions of this Ordinance shall be administered and enforced by 
a City official designated by the Mayor.  This official shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any 
reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections of building or premises necessary in carrying out 
his duties in the enforcement of this Ordinance. 

2.2  Planning Commission.  The planning commission is hereby charged with the responsibility to 
review, guide, and monitor the enforcement of this ordinance in accordance with the adopted compre-
hensive plan or portions thereof, as may be applicable. The planning commission shall hear and recom-
mend to the city council on all matters of zoning and the initial zoning of newly annexed land. 

2.3  Invalid Permits.  

A. No zoning permit, building permit, certificate of occupancy, or business license, or any other permit 
or license shall be issued by any City department, official, or employee except in full compliance with 
this Ordinance. 

B. Any permit or license issued by any City department, official, or employee, where issued in conflict 
with or violation of any terms of this Ordinance or other applicable codes or ordinances, shall hereby 
be declared null and void. 

2.4  Approval of Plans and Issuance of Zoning Permit. 

A. The Enforcement Officer shall not issue a zoning permit for any proposed construction or develop-
ment activity until an application and accompanying plans or documentation has been filed and 
reviewed in conformance with this Ordinance. To this end, the Enforcement Officer shall require that 
every application for a zoning permit for excavation, construction, use of land, moving, or alteration 
be accompanied by appropriate documentation of compliance with all other applicable codes, or-
dinances, and regulations and a map or plat drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient 
detail to enable the Enforcement Officer to ascertain whether the proposed excavation, construction, 
use of land, moving, or alteration is in conformance with this Ordinance: 
1. The actual shape, proportion, and dimensions of the lot to be built upon. 
2. The shape, size, and location of all buildings or other structures to be erected, altered, or moved 

and of any buildings or other structures already on the lot. 
3. The existing and intended use of all such buildings or other structures. 
4. The setback and side lines of buildings on adjoining lots and such other information concerning 

the lot or the adjoining lots as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this 
Ordinance are being observed. 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     117

Article VI: Administrative and Enforcement Guidelines
5. The locations of all existing zoning district boundaries that apply to the lot. 

B. Where a zoning permit application for a multi-family development containing in excess of twen-
ty-five (25) units, a commercial or institutional use building containing in excess of fifteen thousand 
(15,000) square feet of gross floor area, or an industrial use building containing in excess of fifty thou-
sand (50,000) square feet of gross floor area has been submitted, the applicant may be required by 
the Enforcement Officer to submit a special Traffic Impact Study for review and consideration by the 
Planning Commission prior to approval of a Zoning Permit. The preparation cost of said traffic impact 
study shall be borne by the applicant. The traffic impact study shall determine the number of average 
daily vehicle trips and peak hour trips that will be generated by the proposed development (accord-
ing to the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ Trip Generation Manual) and 
assess the impacts that these trips will have on traffic volumes on all streets providing access to the 
development and the resulting impacts on the peak hour level of service for all impacted major inter-
sections identified by the Enforcement Officer and/or City Engineer.  The study shall be prepared by 
a qualified consultant approved by the Planning Commission.  The purpose of the study and review 
by the Planning Commission shall be to determine the adequacy of the surrounding street network 
to safely accommodate potential traffic generated by the proposed development, as well as the need 
for special restrictions on the scale or intensity of the development, the need for special conditions 
of approval, which may include special curb cut requirements, special restrictions on access to the 
development site from affected streets, special traffic controls at the main entrance to the develop-
ment site, and the construction of special acceleration or deceleration lanes at the entrance(s) to the 
development site. 

C. If the proposed excavation, construction, moving, or alteration as set forth in the application are in 
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance and other City codes, the Enforcement Officer shall 
issue a zoning permit accordingly. The issuance of a zoning permit shall, in no case, be construed as 
waiving any provision of this Ordinance. 

D. If the application is rejected, the Enforcement Officer shall state in writing on the application the rea-
son for rejection. 

E. Any Zoning Permit granted under this section shall become null and void within one (1) year form the 
date of issuance of the permit.  Exceptions may be made if the proposed development or construc-
tion has passed the first building inspection. The building official or enforcement officer shall make 
every reasonable effort to notify a holder of a building permit which is liable for voiding action before 
voidance is actually declared. 

2.5  Certificate of Occupancy Required. 

A. No land or building or other structure or part thereof hereafter constructed, moved, or altered in ac-
cordance with a zoning permit shall be occupied until the Enforcement Officer has issued a Certificate 
of Occupancy stating that such land or structure or part thereof is found to be in conformity with the 
provisions of this Ordinance and with all applicable building codes. 

B. Within three (3) regular business days after the owner or his agent has notified the Enforcement Of-
ficer that a building or premises or part thereof is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of 
the Enforcing Officer to make final inspection of the development site, and to issue a Certificate of 
Occupancy if the building or premises or part thereof is found to conform with the provisions of this 
Ordinance and other City codes. 

C. If a Certificate of Occupancy is denied, the Enforcement Officer shall state in writing the reason for 
rejection. 

SECTION 3 - TEMPORARY LAND USES 

3.1  Temporary uses, as set forth below, are declared to possess characteristics which require certain 



118 

Article VI: Administrative and Enforcement Guidelines
controls in order to insure compatibility with other uses in the districts within which they are proposed 
for location. The Enforcement Officer is authorized to issue a Temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance 
for any of the following temporary uses: 

A. Carnival, circus, or fair in any commercial district, for a period not to exceed twenty one (21) days, 
subject to the approval of the City Council. 

B. Religious meeting in a tent or other temporary structure in any district, for a period not to exceed 
sixty (60) days. 

C. Open lot sale of Christmas trees in any district, for a period not to exceed forty-five (45) days. 
D. Real estate sales office in any district, for a period not to exceed one (1) year, provided that such office 

is placed on the property to which it is appurtenant. 
E. Other temporary uses are subject to the approval of the City Council. 

3.2  All Temporary Certificates of Zoning Compliance may be renewed, provided that it is deter-
mined that said use is clearly of a temporary nature, will cause no traffic congestion, and would not create 
a nuisance to surrounding uses. 

SECTION 4 - VIOLATION PROCEDURES 

Where a violation of the requirements of this Ordinance has been identified, either by complaint or by City 
staff inspection, the following procedures shall be followed. 

4.1  Investigation.  If a complaint is received regarding an alleged violation of this Ordinance, the 
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall investigate the complaint and document the extent of the violation. 

4.2  Initial notification of violation.  Once a violation has been confirmed and documented by in-
vestigation, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall issue a stop work order (if applicable) and/or prepare a 
letter to the owner of record of the property stating the nature of the violation, the date that the violation 
was verified, and requiring that the property owner cure the violation within a specified number of days 
from the date that the letter was mailed.  The deadline for correction of the violation shall be established 
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer with due consideration and respect for the nature of the violation, the 
amount of work necessary to correct the violation, and the need for expeditious remedy of the violation 
to prevent undue public impacts.  However, in no instance shall the deadline for correction of the viola-
tion be less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date that the letter was mailed.  
The letter also shall state that the owner must correct the violation, or the City will issue a citation.  Final-
ly, the letter shall afford the offending property owner an opportunity to schedule a meeting with the 
Zoning Enforcement Officer within five (5) business days to discuss objections to the violation or to make 
special arrangements to cure the violation.  Such notification letter shall be sent to the property owner 
via certified mail, return receipt requested.  The City may, at the discretion of the Zoning Enforcement 
Officer, send a copy of the letter to the developer or tenant of the property (as the case may be) by first 
class mail. 

4.3  Re-inspection. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall, at the expiration of the prescribed dead-
line for correction of the violation, re-inspect the property for compliance with the notification of viola-
tion. 

4.4  Notice of citation.  If, upon re-inspection, the Zoning Enforcement Officer confirms that the 
violation has not been cured as ordered, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall prepare a notice of cita-
tion, which shall be sent to the offending property by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice 
shall state the date upon which the initial violation was confirmed, the nature of the violation (including 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     119

Article VI: Administrative and Enforcement Guidelines
references to the specific code provisions that have been violated), the required corrective measures, the 
dates upon which the initial notification of violation was sent and received, the time frame afforded to 
the property owner for correction of the violation, the date that the failure to correct the violation was 
confirmed, and the amount of the applicable fine, which shall be calculated from the date of citation and 
full payment of which shall constitute an additional remedial action for correction of the violation. The 
notice also shall require the property owner to fully correct the violation within ten (10) days of the date 
of citation, or the owner will be required to appear before the Municipal Court, at a time and date to be 
determined by the Municipal Court, to answer the charge of violation as explained in the notice of cita-
tion. 

4.5  Court action.  If the Zoning Enforcement Officer confirms that the violation has not been cured 
within the time frame specified in the notice of citation, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall file a writ-
ten complaint for relief of the violation with the Municipal Court. 

SECTION 5 - TEMPORARY EMERGENCY RELIEF 

The Planning Commission is hereby granted authority to provide immediate emergency and temporary relief 
to applicants requesting such relief, by issuing permits authorizing installation of temporary manufactured 
homes on applicant’s property under the following conditions: 

5.1  Such permit shall be temporary and not exceed six (6) months from date of issuance, or until a 
replacement home has been issued a Certificate of Occupancy, whichever occurs first. 

5.2  Such permit shall not be transferable. 

5.3  Prior to issuance of such permit, the Planning Commission shall, at its discretion, be reasonably 
satisfied that the applicant’s requested relief is necessary and the need therefore was proximately caused 
by damage resulting from fire or natural disasters. 

5.4  Said temporary manufactured home shall be used exclusively as the temporary domicile of the 
household affected by the fire or natural disasters only during the time required to reconstruct or replace

a variance is submitted demonstrating all of the following: 
1. That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or build-

ing involved and which are not generally applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the 
same district.

commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this Ordinance. 

3. That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicants or the 
legal owners of the property. 

4. That granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that 
is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 

B. No variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is not permitted by this 
Ordinance. 

C. In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safe-

affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be

City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     123

Article VIII: Amendments
ARTICLE VIII: AMENDMENTS 

SECTION 1 - PROCEDURES 

1.1  The regulations and the number, area, and boundaries of districts established by this Ordinance 
may be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed by the City Council, but no amend-
ment shall become effective unless and until it is first submitted to the City Planning Commission for its 
recommendation. The Planning Commission, upon its own initiative, shall hold public hearings, public 
notice of which shall be provided, for the consideration of any proposed amendment to the provisions of 
this Ordinance or to the Zoning Map of Alexander City, and report its recommendations to the City Coun-
cil. The provisions of Section 78 of Title 11 of the 1975 Code of Alabama, as the same may be amended, 
shall apply to all changes and amendments. 

1.2  Changes in zoning (rezoning) may appear to reduce the certainty of protection to owners of 
neighboring property and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to the City of Alexander City. 
However, future changes to the zoning map will be needed to provide opportunities for future growth 
which will sustain the City’s economic vitality, provide new and better job opportunities for City residents, 
and fuel future appreciation in local property values. This ordinance contains standards and procedures 
intended to insure that neighbors, the citizenry-at-large, and the City of Alexander City are protected 
from adverse impacts; and that the community’s general welfare is protected and enhanced. Distinctions 
between zoning districts are significant and are based on the policies contained in the Alexander City 
comprehensive plan.  The districts are sized and located to meet the needs in Alexander City for preser-
vation of stable, existing development; for improvement of declining and transitional areas; and to en-
courage and promote growth and long-term economic stability.  This ordinance contains clear, detailed 
procedures for the justified change of zoning district designations, in accordance with the Alexander City 
comprehensive plan, as time passes. 

SECTION 2 - AUTHORIZED PETITIONERS 

The City Council of the City of Alexander City, Alabama, may amend, supplement, change, modify, or repeal 
the regulations, restrictions, boundaries of districts or any provision of this ordinance. Any member of the city 
council may introduce such amendment; or any official, board, commission or any other person may present 
a petition to the City requesting an amendment or amendments to this ordinance.  Whenever a petition for 
amendment has been filed by an administrative or legislative body of the City or a duly authorized agent or 
representative of the City, all required application fees shall be waived. 

SECTION 3 - PETITION FOR AMENDMENT 

A petition for amendment, when initiated by a citizen, property owner, or authorized agent of such owner, 
shall meet the application requirements of this section. 

3.1  Any persons, firm, or corporation desiring to petition for rezoning under the authority of this 
section must present such petition to the Enforcement Officer in writing, at least fifteen (15) days prior to 
the Planning Commission hearing. The petition shall be accompanied by the following information and 
materials: 

A. Name, signature, and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, if any. 
B. Address and legal description of the property under consideration, accompanied by a copy of the 

applicable tax maps clearly identifying the property subject to rezoning. 
C. Present and proposed zoning and land use of the property under consideration. 



124 

Article VIII: Amendments
D. Reason for the rezoning request. 
E. A site plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the size and location of the property boundar-

ies, public right-of-ways, and the proposed use and development layout. 
F. The required application fee. 

SECTION 4 - PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION 

4.1  Notice of public hearing.  Where a zoning amendment or rezoning petition has been properly 
requested, the City Clerk shall publish, at least six (6) days prior to the date of the scheduled planning 
commission hearing, a public hearing notice regarding the proposed amendment, in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the City.  The notice shall state the following information: 
A. The name of the petitioner. 
B. The location of the City Hall, where a copy of the proposed zoning amendment or rezoning ordinance 

may be inspected prior to the hearing. 
C. A general description of the location of the property affected and the nature of the petition. If the 

ordinance is an amendment to the text of the ordinance that will affect the entire City, then the notice 
may so indicate in words without the need for a special map. 

D. The current and proposed zoning and land use of the property (if applicable to the proposed ordi-
nance). 

E. The time, date, and location of the Planning Commission hearing of the proposed zoning amend-
ment or rezoning petition. 

4.2  Scheduling of hearing.  The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing at the first reg-
ularly scheduled meeting after compliance with the application and notice requirements of this Ordi-
nance. 

4.3 Planning Commission recommendation.  The Planning Commission, by majority vote, shall 
recommend approval or denial of the requested zoning amendment or rezoning. Once a recommenda-
tion has been approved, the Planning Commission report its recommendations and the findings thereof 
to the City Council.  The Planning Commission report shall be transmitted to the City Council within 
thirty (30) days of the hearing, unless an extension period is granted by the City Council.  If the Planning 
Commission fails to make a formal recommendation on the petition within the required thirty (30) days, 
the proposed amendment shall be considered to have been recommended for approval by the Planning 
Commission.  To obtain an extension period from the City Council, the Planning Commission shall enter-
tain a motion to request such extension, then shall immediately forward such request to the City Council 
for consideration at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting. 

SECTION 5 - CITY COUNCIL ACTION 

5.1  Scheduling of public hearing.  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commis-
sion, the City Council shall schedule a public hearing on the proposed amendment or rezoning petition 
at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting. 

5.2  Public hearing notice.  At least three (3) consecutive weeks (21 calendar days) in advance of 
the City Council’s scheduled final public hearing date, a public hearing notice for the scheduled zoning 
amendment or rezoning hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City in 
accordance with the provisions of Title 11, Chapter 52, Section 77 (2) of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as 
amended.  Said notice shall be published at least once per week for each of the three weeks of the re-
quired notification period, in standard legal form, and at least one additional time during that period in 
the form of at least a one quarter (1/4) page advertisement. The City Council shall hold a public hearing 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     125

Article VIII: Amendments
at the first regularly scheduled meeting after compliance with the notice requirements of this Ordinance. 
The required public notice shall contain the following information: 
A. The name of the petitioner. 
B. The location of the City Hall, where a copy of the proposed zoning amendment or rezoning ordinance 

may be inspected prior to the hearing. 
C. A general description of the location of the property affected and the nature of the petition. If the 

ordinance is an amendment to the text of the ordinance that will affect the entire City, then the notice 
may so indicate in words without the need for a special map. 

D. The current and proposed zoning and land use of the property (if applicable to the proposed ordi-
nance). 

E. The time, date, and location of the Planning Commission hearing of the proposed zoning amend-
ment or rezoning petition. 

5.3  Approval or denial.  After the public hearing on a rezoning petition or proposed amendment 
to the zoning ordinance, the City Council shall vote to approve or deny the amendment.  Failure by the 
City Council to vote in favor or denial of a proposed amendment shall constitute denial of the amend-
ment without a formal vote. 

SECTION 6 - TIME LIMIT 

After the City Council has voted to deny an application for rezoning or other amendment to the Zoning Or-
dinance, another application for rezoning of the same tract or parcel of land, or change of the same portion 
of the Zoning Ordinance, will not be considered until a period of six (6) months has elapsed from the date of 
such action by the City Council. Provided, however, that the City Council may adjust this time period, if in the 
opinion of a majority of the City Council an unusual situation or circumstance exists. 

SECTION 7 - INITIAL ZONING OF ANNEXED PROPERTY 

7.1  Application for zoning.  An application for zoning of property to be annexed shall accompany 
each petition for annexation.  The application for zoning shall be made on a form available from the City 
Clerk and be filed with the City Clerk at least fifteen (15) regular business days prior to the Planning Com-
mission hearing.  The City Clerk shall transmit such petition and application to the Planning Commission, 
which shall hold a public hearing and give notice of such hearing in accordance with the notice require-
ments in Subparagraph 4.1 (Notice of public hearing) of this Article. 

7.2  Planning Commission action.  The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing at the 
first regularly scheduled meeting after submission and acceptance of the application.  The Planning 
Commission, by majority vote, shall report its recommendations to the City Council as to whether the 
property to be annexed should be brought into the City in the zoning district requested by the applicant 
or, if the Planning Commission believes the requested zoning designation to be inappropriate, in the 
RR - Reserve Residential Zoning District. The Planning Commission report shall be transmitted to the City 
Council within thirty (30) days of the hearing date, unless the City Council grants an extension of such 
period. Otherwise, the zoning classification requested by the applicant shall be deemed to have been 
recommended by the Planning Commission. 

7.3  City Council action.  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission, the 
City Council shall schedule and hold a public hearing on the recommended zoning of the property to be 
annexed. Such hearing shall not be held until the City Council has annexed said property into the City, 
but may be  conducted immediately following adoption of the annexation ordinances. The City Council 
shall give public notice of the hearing on the recommended zoning in accordance with Subparagraph 



126 

Article VIII: Amendments
5.2 (Public hearing notice) of this Article. Following such hearing, the City Council shall decide by ma-
jority vote to accept or reject the recommended zoning.  If the recommended zoning is accepted, such 
property shall be added to the Alexander City Zoning Map.  If the recommended zoning is rejected, such 
ordinances shall be remanded to the Planning Commission for reconsideration. 

7.4  Planning Commission reconsideration. If the City Council rejects the zoning recommended 
by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission, within thirty (30) days following annexation, 
shall review the zoning of the newly annexed property and, if determined necessary, initiate a petition to 
rezone the property to the most appropriate district, in accordance with Section 3 (Petition for Amend-
ment) of this Article.  No fee shall be paid by the applicant for any reconsideration and rezoning action 
by the Planning Commission conducted in accordance with this Subparagraph.  In determining the most 
appropriate zoning, the Planning Commission shall duly consider the following minimum items: 

A. The Alexander City Comprehensive Plan, as adopted by the Planning Commission, as well as other 
relevant land use and planning studies; 

B. The desires of the property owner subject to rezoning, as well as concerns of adjacent property own-
ers; 

C. The purposes and considerations of zoning, as required by this ordinance and Section 11-52-72 of the 
Code of Alabama, as amended. 

7.5  Action on Planning Commission petition.  The Planning Commission and City Council shall 
act on the Planning Commission petition to rezone the newly annexed property in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sections 4 and 5 of this Article. 

SECTION 8 - SPECULATIVE REZONINGS 

The City of Alexander City discourages the use of rezonings as a strategy to increase speculative land value, 
where the applicant has no actual or immediate intent to develop in accordance with the rezoning. Rezonings 
are intended to grant the applicant an opportunity to exercise appropriate alternative development options 
in situations where development in compliance with existing zoning is not possible or practicable, as long as 
the proposed uses are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the character of the surrounding area.  
The granting of this privilege by the City carries with it a good faith expectation that the proposed devel-
opment will occur in a timely and deliberate manner.  Therefore, when the City Council grants approval of a 
rezoning, the applicant should acquire a zoning permit or final plat approval (whichever is applicable) and 
commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one (1) year of the date 
upon which the rezoning is approved. If such actions have not been taken within the specified time frame, 
the Planning Commission may initiate actions to further rezone the subject property and/or to reinstate the 
original zoning classification. 

SECTION 9 - FEES  

9.1  Every applicant or petitioner seeking an amendment to the zoning ordinance or map of the 
City of Alexander City, other than amendments initiated by the City Council, Enforcement Officer, Board 
of Adjustment, or Planning Commission, shall pay a fee to the City Clerk at the time of filing such petition 
or application. 

9.2  A flat administrative and review fee of $500.00 shall accompany each request for appeal or zon-
ing amendment.
 
9.3  In addition, the actual costs for legal advertisement of the request and notification of parties 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     127

Article VIII: Amendments
in interest shall be paid by the applicant prior to any decision by the Board of Adjustment, the Planning 
Commission or the City Council. 



128 

Article VIII: Amendments
ARTICLE IX: LEGAL PROVISIONS 

SECTION 1 - CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS 

In interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be considered minimum requirements 
adopted for the promotion of health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and general welfare of the 
community.  Where two or more specific requirements in this ordinance conflict and the ordinance does not 
otherwise specify which of the conflicting requirements prevail, then the requirement imposing the higher 
or greater restriction shall govern.  Where other ordinances or regulations which may be adopted hereafter 
impose greater restrictions than those specified herein, compliance with such other ordinances or regulations 
is mandatory.  Whenever the requirements of this ordinance conflict or are in any way inconsistent with the 
requirements of any other lawfully adopted statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, the most restrictive, or 
that imposing higher standards, shall govern, unless otherwise specifically stated in this Ordinance. No cer-
tificate of zoning compliance or plat approval shall be issued or considered valid for any use or activity which 
is or would be otherwise illegal under the terms of any applicable local, State, or Federal Law. This Ordinance 
shall not lower the restrictions of plats, deeds, or private contracts, if such are greater than the provisions of 
this Ordinance. 

SECTION 2 - REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES 

All previously adopted zoning ordinances or parts of zoning ordinances that are in conflict with this Zoning 
Ordinance, or inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance, are hereby repealed to the extent necessary 
to give this Ordinance full force and effect. 

SECTION 3 - SEVERABILITY 

If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by 
any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, provision, or por-
tion of this Ordinance which is not, in and of itself, invalid or unconstitutional. 

SECTION 4 - VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES 

Any failure to comply with the applicable requirements of this Ordinance shall constitute a violation of these 
Regulations under Title 11, Chapter 52, Section 83 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended.  Any such 
violation shall be punishable by a fine of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dol-
lars ($500.00) and or imprisonment of not more than six (6) months, as provided in accordance with Title 11, 
Chapter 45, Section 9 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended.  Where such a violation has been confirmed 
to exist by the Enforcement Officer, the violation shall be cured in accordance with the administrative proce-
dures outlined in Article VI, Section 4 of these Regulations.  Each day such violation continues shall constitute 
a separate offense. 

In case any building or other structure is erected, demolished, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, 
converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is used in violation of this ordinance, the building 
official of the municipality or any other appropriate authority, in addition to other remedies, may institute 
injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, demoli-
tion, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, to correct or abate such 
violations or to prevent occupancy of such building, structures, or land. 



City of Alexander City Zoning Ordinance     129

Article VIII: Amendments
SECTION 5 - RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND BYLAWS 

A property owner may impose bylaws, covenants, and deed restrictions upon any private property. Once 
any such bylaws, covenants, and deed restrictions have been recorded, they can be administered only by the 
owner of the property, and they may be enforced only by private legal action through a court of competent 
jurisdiction.  The City of Alexander City and the Alexander City Planning Commission is in no way liable for and 
assumes no responsibility to approve, enforce, amend, or administer any duly adopted or recorded bylaws, 
covenants, and deed restrictions. Furthermore, advance knowledge by the City prior to Final Plat approval 
that any such bylaws, covenants, and deed restrictions will be imposed by the land owner shall in no way 
constitute implied authority or responsibility to approve, enforce, amend, or administer any subsequently ad-
opted or recorded restrictive covenants or bylaws. Finally, no such authority shall be implied by the granting 
of a zoning permit for any development activity on a property for which special bylaws, covenants, or deed 
restrictions have been or will be imposed. 

SECTION 6 - EFFECTIVE DATE 

This Ordinance shall take effect on the date of final publication by the City, in accordance with Title 11, Chapter 
45, Section 8 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended.
