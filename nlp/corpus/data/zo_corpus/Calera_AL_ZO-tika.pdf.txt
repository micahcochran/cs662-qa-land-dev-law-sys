perform required inspections to insure such conformance; 

2. Issue and renew where applicable, all temporary use permits and maintain records thereof; 

3. Maintain current zoning maps and records of amendments thereto; 

4. Have the right to enter upon any premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections of land, structures 
and buildings necessary to carry out the enforcement of this Ordinance. If the Zoning Administrator shall find that any of the 
provisions of this Ordinance are being violated, he or she shall proceed to notify, in writing, the person or persons 
responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation(s) and ordering the appropriate action necessary to 
correct it. He or she shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal of illegal buildings or 
structures or of additions, alterations or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall 
take any other action authorized by this Ordinance to insure compliance with, or to prevent violation of its provisions. 

 
§2.2. Building Permit Required 

It shall be unlawful: to commence earthwork or the construction of any building or other structure, including accessory 
structures, or signs; to store building materials or erect temporary field offices; to commence the moving, alteration or repair of 
any structure, including accessory structures, until the Building Inspector has issued for such work a Building Permit, including a 
statement that the plans, specifications and intended use of such building or structure conforms with the provisions of this 
Ordinance in all respects. Application for a Building Permit shall be made to the Building Inspector on forms provided for that 
purpose. 

2.2.1. Plot Plan. It shall be unlawful for the Zoning Administrator to approve any plans or for the Building Inspector to issue Building 
Permits for any excavation or construction until such plans are in conformity with this Ordinance. To this end, every application 
for a Building Permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale, dimensioned and showing the Plot Plan requirements 
in Appendix A in sufficient detail to ascertain whether or not the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of 
this Ordinance. 

2.2.2. Site Plan Review. New construction and substantial site development expansion of all planned residential developments, 
townhouses, garden homes, five (5) or more multi-family dwellings, manufactured home parks, manufactured home 
subdivisions, institutional uses, commercial uses and industrial uses shall require the submission and approval of a site plan 
prepared by a Registered Engineer, with the minimum information described in Appendix A. One set of reproducible plans and 
five (5) copies of each set shall be submitted for approval. 

2.2.3. Approval of Building Permit Application. If, after review, it is found that the proposed construction, excavation, moving or other 
alteration (as set forth in the application) is in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, the Building Inspector shall 
issue a Building Permit accordingly. 

2.2.4. Denial of Building Permit Application. The applicant, upon notification in writing by the Building Inspector of a Building Permit 
denial, may make application with the Chairman of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the “ZBA”, and 
request a hearing before that body. 

2.2.5. Certificate of Occupancy. No land or building or other structure or part thereof erected, moved or altered in its use shall be 
used or occupied until the Building Inspector has issued a Certificate of Occupancy. Within three (3) days after the owner or his 
or her agent has notified the Building Inspector that a building or premises thereof is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the 
duty of the Building Inspector to make a final inspection thereof and issue a Certificate of Occupancy, if the building or 
premises or part thereof is found to conform with the provisions of this Ordinance; or if such certificate is refused, to state the 
refusal in writing with the cause. One (1) copy of the signed statement by the owner or his or her agent regarding the intended 
use of the premises and a signed refusal (if any) shall be kept on file with the records of the Building Inspector. Appeals from

2.2.6. Expiration of Building Permit. Any permit under which no construction work has been done above the foundation wall or other 
foundation support within six (6) months from the date of issuance shall expire by limitation but shall upon reapplication, be 
renewable, subject, however, to the provisions of all Ordinances in force at the time of said application for renewal. In no event 
shall any permit be renewed more than one time. 

 
§2.3. Unlawful Structures 

Any uses of land or dwellings or construction or alteration of buildings or structures erected, altered, razed or converted in 
violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be a nuisance per se. The Zoning Administrator is 
hereby authorized to apply to a court of equity to abate the nuisance created by such unlawful use of a structure, land or 
building. Whenever the Zoning Administrator has declared a structure to be in violation of any applicable provisions of this 
Ordinance, the owner or occupant shall, within seventy-two (72) hours from receipt of notification from said official to vacate 
such premises, accomplish such vacation of said structure or premises which shall not again be used or occupied until such 
structure or premises has been adapted to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. Service of notification shall be as 
follows: 

2.3.1. By delivery to the owner personally or by leaving the notice at the usual place of abode of the owner with a person of suitable 
age and discretion 

2.3.2. By depositing the notice in the United States Post Office addressed to the owner at his or her last known address with postage 
prepaid thereon 

2.3.3. By posting and keeping posted twenty-four (24) hours, a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises to be 
repaired 

 
§2.4. Penalties and Remedies 

2.4.1. Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation, or other organization which violates any provisions of this Ordinance shall be fined, 
upon conviction, not less than one dollar($1.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and court costs for each offense. 
Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. The conviction of a violation and imposition of any fine 
shall not constitute an exemption from compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 

2.4.2. Remedies. In case any building or other structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, 
maintained; or, any building, structure or land is used in violation of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator or any other 
appropriate authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner within 500 ft who would be damaged or caused hardship 
by such violation, in addition to other remedies, may: 

1. Institute an injunction. 

2. Institute a Mandamus. 

3. Take other appropriate action or proceedings to stay or prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land. 

 
§2.5. Interpretation of District Boundaries 

The Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) shall make an interpretation of the Zoning Map of Calera, Alabama upon request of any 
person. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps, the following rules shall apply: 

2.5.1. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley lines or land lot lines, such lines shall be construed 
to be such boundaries. 

2.5.2. In un-subdivided property or tracts where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are 
indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on such maps. 

2.5.3. Where boundaries are approximately parallel to public right-of-way lines, such boundaries shall be construed as being parallel 
thereto. 

 
§2.6. Interpretation of Uses 

This ordinance recognizes the limitations of the district use listings given the infinite variations of essentially similar uses. 
Therefore, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to make interpretations so as to classify any questioned use within a listed 
use of most similar impact and characteristics. However, in no case shall the Zoning Administrator interpret a use as falling in 



Article 2 ADMINISTRATIVE AND REVIEW PROCEDURES 

11 

 

 

 

one listed use when the use in question is more similar in impact and characteristics to another listed use. Any appeals related to 
the Zoning Administrator's use interpretation may be filed with the ZBA. 

 
§2.7. Unclassified Uses 

In the event the Zoning Administrator finds a new or unusual use that cannot appropriately fit a listed use in any district, the 
following procedures shall be followed: 

2.7.1. If compatible with the existing zoning district intent, the unclassified use shall be permitted by Special Exception upon approval 
and subject to the conditions set by the ZBA. 

2.7.2. If the unclassified use would not be compatible with the intent of the existing zoning district, the Zoning Administrator shall 
determine the most appropriate zoning district classification and require the property in question to be rezoned. In addition, the 
unclassified use shall be permitted in the new district by special exception if granted approval by the ZBA. 

2.7.3. Following final action on the unclassified use, as (1) and (2) above may require, the Planning Commission, hereinafter referred 
to as the Commission, may initiate an amendment to this Ordinance to list the newly permitted use in the most appropriate 
district(s). 

 
§2.8. Zoning Board of Adjustment 

2.8.1. Appointment. A Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) is hereby established. Such board shall be appointed as provided by the 
Code of Alabama, 1975, Section 11-52-80 or as such, may be amended; and, it shall have all powers granted therein. 

2.8.2. Procedure. The ZBA, shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct of its affairs, and in keeping with the provisions of this 
Ordinance. Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairman or in his or her absence, the acting Chairman. He or she may 
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings shall be open to the public. The ZBA shall keep 
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote, indicating such fact and shall keep records of its examinations and other official 
actions, all of which shall be a public record and be immediately filed in the office of the ZBA. 

2.8.3. Powers and Duties. The ZBA shall have the following powers and duties as granted in §2.8.2 above and as herein specified. 

1. Administrative Review. The ZBA shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that an error exists in any order, 
requirements, decision or determination made by the administrative official in the enforcement of this Ordinance. 

a. Action on Appeals. In exercising the above mentioned powers, the ZBA may, so long as such action is in conformity 
with the terms of this Ordinance, reverse, or affirm (wholly or partly) or modify the order, requirement, decision or 
determination as to what should be made; and, to that end, shall have powers of the administrative official from 
whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the ZBA shall be necessary to reverse any order, 
requirement, decision or determination of said official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which 
it is required to pass under this Ordinance or to affect any variation in the application of this Ordinance. [Code of 
Alabama, 1975, Section 11 -52-80] 

b. Appeals - How Taken 

(1) Appeals to the ZBA may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the 
City affected by any decision of the administrative official. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, 
not to exceed thirty (30) days or such lesser period as may be provided by the rules of the ZBA, by filing with the 
Zoning Administrator and with the ZBA a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The administrative official 
shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting which the action appealed from was taken. 

(2) The ZBA shall fix a reasonable time for hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the 
parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or 
by agent or attorney. 

(3) Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the 
administrative official certifies to the ZBA (after the notice of appeal is filed by him or her) that by reason of facts 
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, 
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the ZBA or by a court of 
record on application, on notice to the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause 
shown.

c. Appeals from the Action of the ZBA. Any party aggrieved by any final judgment of the ZBA, may appeal therefrom to 
the Circuit Court or court of like jurisdiction as provided by Code of Alabama, 1975, Section 11-52-81 or as the same 
may be amended within 15 days from the date of the board hearing. 

2. Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary 
to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result 
in unnecessary hardship. 

a. Justification. Variances to the terms of this Chapter may be granted individual cases upon a finding by the ZBA that 
the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of 
the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. Another essential factor is that the spirit of the 
Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. More specifically, the ZBA shall determine all of the 
following criteria have been satisfied. 

(1) The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship, even to the extent of authorizing 
nonconforming uses. Where the Board authorizes a nonconforming use in a district to prevent unnecessary 
hardship, all relevant factors, when taken together, must indicate that the plight of the premises in question is 
unique in that they cannot be put reasonably to a conforming use because of the limitations imposed upon them by 
reason of their classification in a specific zone. 

(2) Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. 

(3) Hardship alone is NOT sufficient. Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship. [Not self-created and involving 
the design or other limitations of the land itself] 

(4) Mere financial loss of a kind, which might be common to all of the property owners in a district, is not an 
unnecessary hardship. 

(5) When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for claim that a variance should be granted. 

Variances should be granted sparingly and the spirit of this Ordinance, in harmony with the spirit of State Law, should be 
carefully preserved to the end, that the structure of this Section would not disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at 
the hands of the ZBA. 

b. Application for a Variance. An application for a variance shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator at least twenty- 
one (21) days ahead of the scheduled hearing date before the ZBA. The application shall be filed by the property 
owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made available from the Zoning Administrator and shall include 
the materials listed in Appendix A. 

c. Public Notice Required. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled ZBA hearing, the Chairman of the ZBA shall 
give written notice of the variance request to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when 
deposited in the United States Mail - first class, postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at the 
addresses as submitted with the variance application. Any error in the address of such notices shall not invalidate the 
giving of notice, provided that no more than five (5) percent of the total number of notices given contain any such 
error. Such notice shall state the following: 

(1) The name of the applicant 

(2) The location of the property 

(3) The nature of the variance and applicable zoning provisions 

(4) The time, date and location of the ZBA hearing at which said application is to be considered 

3. Special Exception Uses. In certain cases, certain land uses are identified for special zoning treatment. The nature of these 
uses is such that, when properly regulated, they are appropriate in several districts. In order to bring about the proper 
integration of uses into the City's land use pattern, a special set of criteria or standards may be provided for each use listed 
in the Special Exception Use category. Review of these standards will tend to maintain compatibility with adjoining land uses 
and it is intended that the ZBA will review all such proposals for these types of uses for compliance with the appropriate 
provisions before approval is granted and appropriate permits are issued. 

a. Special Exception Procedures. All uses listed as permitted by special exception shall require the submission of an 
application to the ZBA. An application for a special exception use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 
twenty-one (21) days ahead of the scheduled hearing date before the ZBA. An application shall be filed by the 
property owner or authorized agent on a form made available by the Zoning Administrator. Such form shall be 
completed by the applicant or agent and include the materials listed in Appendix A.

b. Public Notice. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled ZBA public hearing, the Chairman shall give written 
notice of the proposal to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the 
United States Mail first class, prepaid, addressed to those property owners at their addresses as submitted by the 
applicant at the time application was made. Any error in the addresses of such notices shall not invalidate the giving 
of notice provided not more than five (5) percent of the total number of notices contain any such error. Such notice 
shall contain the following: 

(1) The name of the applicant 

(2) The location of the property 

(3) The proposed use by Special Exception 

(4) The time, date and location of the ZBA Public Hearing

stating further that at such time and place all persons who desire shall have an opportunity of being heard in 
opposition to or in favor of such ordinance. 

b. After such public hearing, the Council may adopt the proposed amending ordinance as recommended by the 
Commission or in such amended form as it deems best. However, if the Council makes substantial or material 
changes from the proposed amending ordinance as first advertised, the Council shall hold another public hearing on 
the proposed amending ordinance as changed, after giving notice as provided in Item a above. 

2.10.5. Limitations on Rezoning Requests. Should the Council reject a rezoning amendment proposal by a property owner, the same 
kind of rezoning of the same tract of land will not be considered by the Commission until a period of six (6) months has elapsed 
from the date of such action by the Council. Further, a withdrawal of the application for rezoning, after the hearing held by the 
Commission but prior to the hearing held by the Council, shall also require a six (6) month time period before another 
application may be submitted. However, the Commission may adjust this time period if in the opinion of a majority of the 
Commission, an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing. Each time the zoning 
amendment application is made, the required filing fee must be paid. Under no condition shall the fee be refunded for failure of 
such proposed amendment to be enacted into law.

§5.21. TND Traditional Neighborhood Development District 

5.21.1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to allow the optional development and redevelopment of land consistent with 
the design principles of traditional neighborhoods. A Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND): 

1. Is compact and designed for the human scale; 

2. Provides a mix of uses in close proximity to one another within the neighborhood; 

3. Provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes; 

4. Incorporates a system of relatively narrow, interconnected streets with sidewalks and bikeways that offer multiple routes for 
motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and provides for the connections of those streets to existing and future developments; 
and 

5. Incorporates significant environmental features into the design. 

5.21.2. Applicability. This section is an alternative set of standards for development for: 1) new development of thirty (30) acres or 
more; 2) fifteen (15) acres or more for development contiguous to existing development; or 3) five (5) acres or more for 
development of areas designated as neighborhood centers in the Comprehensive Plan. 

5.21.3. Definitions. The following definitions shall be observed and applied, except when the context clearly indicates otherwise. 

1. BUILDING SCALE The relationship between the size of a building and its surroundings, including street width, open space, 
and surrounding buildings. 

2. PLAZA A civic space, predominantly hardscaped, and enclosed on at least two or three sides by building facades. Plazas 
may be publicly or privately owned but, in either case, are designed and maintained for public use. 

3. SQUARE A Common Open Space that serves as the focal point for a traditional neighborhood development. It is typically 
surrounded by commercial or mixed-uses and may include a landmark structure or building. 

5.21.4. Procedures.

discuss procedures for approval, submittal requirements and design standards. 

3. Master Development Plan Submittal Requirements. The purpose of the general implementation plan is to establish the intent, 
density, and intensity for a proposed TND development. In addition to the submittal requirements of §2.10 Amendments, any 
request for approval of a Master Plan of a TND shall also include the following items: 

a. A conceptual storm water management plan identifying the proposed patterns of major storm water runoff, location of 
storm water infiltration areas, and other significant storm water best management practices. 

b. A pattern book representing the site design and architectural patterns of typical residential and non-residential 
buildings. Design patterns shall be conveyed with illustrations of typical proposed elevations including building 
heights, widths and façade treatments. 

c. the location of sidewalks, trails, passages and other pedestrian and bicycle circulation elements 

d. typical street cross sections including streetscape elements (street and pedestrian lighting, street trees, paving 
patterns, etc.) 

e. A utilities plan showing underground and above ground lines and structures for sanitary sewers, electricity, gas 

telecommunications, etc. 

4. Amendments to the Master Plan. Amendments to the TND Master Plan shall follow the procedure in §5.20.6 except that 
minor amendments to the Master Plan may be approved by the Zoning Administrator provided that the changes do not 
involve: 

a. an increase of more than 10% of the floor area of structures other than single family detached dwellings; 

b. an increase of more than 10% of the number of dwelling units; or 

c. an alteration of any conditions or modifications to the Master Plan required by the Commission.

§5.22. MXD Mixed-Use District 

5.22.1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of the Mixed-Use District is to allow market-driven development that is compact, 
diverse and walkable and that enhances character and form through appropriate design. It allows for a mix of compatible uses 
that are either mixed horizontally within a site or vertically within individual buildings. The Mixed-Use District prioritizes the form 
of development rather than the uses. This makes it possible to create special destinations with a "sense of place" and appeal. 
It also: 

1. Encourages the development of mixed-use centers and/or buildings that combine restaurants, offices, housing, live-work 
spaces, civic buildings, cultural buildings and other complementary uses arranged in an environment that is convenient for 
customers, employees, residents and tourists; 

2. Promotes new infill residential and non-residential development; 

3. Promotes site design that accommodates and enhances pedestrian activity along the street, that is not dominated by parking 
and that reduces conflicts between pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles; 

4. Provides unique places for people to live, work, shop, play and learn; and 

5. Encourages appropriate transitions between higher-intensity uses and adjacent lower-density residential districts. 

5.22.2. Permitted Uses. Uses are subject to Table 5.3 Permitted Uses for B-3 and MXD Districts and uses may be further restricted 
according to Table 5.4 Use Restrictions for B-3 and MXD Districts. 

5.22.3. Area and Dimensional Regulations. Where in conflict, these standards superseded those of Article 6 Supplemental 
Regulations. 

1. Blocks and Streets. 

a. Development utilizing the existing city blocks must meet the following standards for street construction: 

(1) Streets must have a sidewalk on both sides of the street, and it must be a minimum of ten feet in width. 

(2) Streets must have a landscaped buffer or planting strip with street trees between the sidewalk and the curb, where 
applicable. The buffer strip must be a minimum of four feet in width. 

b. Development that vacates existing streets and alleys must meet the following standards: 

(1) Dimensional platting requirements of this article supersede those of Section 4.3.1 of the City of Calera Subdivision 
Regulations. These regulations supersede the dimensional requirements of Section 5.2 of the City of Calera 
Subdivision Regulations and Article 2 of the City of Calera Public Works Manual. 

(2) Block perimeters are limited to 2,400 feet in total length of all sides except blocks abutting natural waterways and 
slopes greater than 10% are exempt. Blocks abutting county, state, or federal roadways where access is limited 
are exempt. 



Article 5 Establishment of Districts 

75 

 

 

 

(3) Streets must connect to other streets, forming a network. The city engineer is authorized to permit a deviation to 
this requirement, permitting a dead-end street terminating in a cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs must provide connectivity 
for bicycles and pedestrians. No cul-de-sac may exceed 300 feet to the center of the bulb. 

(4) Sight distance requirements, according to Article 2 Section 3 of the City of Calera Public Works Manual are not 
required for mixed-use zone intersections controlled by a traffic signal or stop sign. 

(5) Streets must have a sidewalk on both sides of the street, and it must be a minimum of ten feet in width. 

(6) Streets must have a landscaped buffer or planting strip with street trees between the sidewalk and the curb, where 
applicable. The buffer strip must be a minimum of four feet in width. 

(7) Streets must have parallel parking on at least one side of the street, and it must be a maximum of eight feet in 
width. This width supersedes Article 8. Section 3.2 and Article 2. Section 1 of the City of Calera Public Works 
Manual. 

(8) Intersection curb radii of 15 feet is required at intersections. On-street parking creates an actual turning radius of 
23 feet.

major changes as defined below. 

b. Major change. A "major change" in the plan shall be defined as a change in the boundaries of any mixed-use district 
reflected on the Master Development Plan that exceed a 20% difference in land area, and any changes in the 
planning criteria submitted with the Master Development Plan, including a change in an approved use from one that 
is permitted to one that is categorized as “special exception” within the applicable MXD land use district. No 
segment, tract, lot or parcel of land within the approved MXD shall be processed for a change of land use districts, to 
other MXD land use district or conventional zoning districts unless the total MXD is submitted along with the rezoning 
request. Any other changes shall be considered "minor changes" and shall not require any additional approvals, 
other than the plat approval which shall be obtained through the typical plat approval procedures of the City. All plats 
for MXD will be reviewed and approved on the basis of the approved planning criteria of the MXD only. 

c. Approval of Major Changes. A major change in the Plan requires an application for change which shall be reviewed 
in accordance with the provisions of §5.22.8.2 Application Process. 

Subdivision Plats and Roads. Nothing in this §5.22 shall be construed to require a Building Permit for approval of

Article 6 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 

 
§6.1. Area Modification for Lots of Record 

The ZBA shall approve all proposed development involving non-conforming lots of record. See §4.6.2 Nonconforming Lots of 
Record. 

 
§6.2. General Yard Requirements 

This section is not applicable to the B-3 and MXD Districts. 

6.2.1. Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky, unobstructed by any structure or part thereof, and, unoccupied for 
storage, servicing or similar uses, except as provided for herein. 

6.2.2. More than one (1) multiple dwelling, office, institutional, industrial or public building may be located upon a lot or tract of land, 
but such dwellings shall not encroach upon the front, side or rear yards required by the district regulations. 

6.2.3. In certain cases the Building Official can reduce either the front or rear yard requirement by no more than (5) five ft in any 
district. A greater reduction may only be approved by the ZBA through a variance. However, the side yards must meet the 
requirements for the applicable district. 

6.2.4. Front Yard Modifications 

1. Where new development is proposed on the same block face as abutting, previously developed lots located within the same 
district with front yards less than required in such district, the following modifications shall apply: 

a. Where a building is to be erected on a parcel that is within 100 ft of existing buildings on both sides, the minimum 
front yard shall be a line drawn between the closest front corners of the adjacent buildings 

b. Where a building is to be erected on a parcel that is within 100 ft of an existing building on one (1) side only, such 
building may be erected as close to the front lot line as the existing building. 

2. Contextual Setbacks. The minimum front yard setback for all lots along a block face that includes multiple zoning districts 
shall be the most restrictive front yard setback required among the districts occurring along that block face (see Figure 6-2, 
Example 1). This shall be considered the contextual setback. However, in the case of a block face wherein a district with a 
greater setback requirement is separated from a district with a lesser setback requirement by an alley, watercourse, buffer, or 
similar physical transition, the contextual setback within the less restrictive district shall be half (1/2) of the setback required 
in the abutting district or the normally required setback of the abutting district, whichever is greater (see Figure 6-2, Example 
2). These adjustments shall also apply to secondary front yards. 

 

Example 1: Where the Lots along Frontage A are in a district with more restrictive Setbacks than those Lots along Frontage B, the Setback 
along Frontage C for Lot 1 is subject to the more restrictive Setback, except as shown in the Example 2. 



Article 6 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 

81 

 

 

 
 

 

Example 2: Where the Lots along Frontage A and those along Frontage B are separated by a public Alley ROW, the “Contextual Setback” 
along Frontage C for Lot 1 shall be the greater of: the normal Setback of the Applicable District for or half of the Setback in the Abutting 
residential district.

Article 8 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 

 
§8.1. Purpose of Off-street Parking and Loading Requirements 

The primary purpose of these provisions is to reduce traffic congestion on public streets of the City by requiring certain minimum 
parking and loading areas be provided off street. Further, these provisions insure safe and convenient access to and from each 
site, as well as safe and efficient on-site traffic circulation and encourage the design of attractive, efficient and harmonious 
facilities. 

 
§8.2. Off-street Parking and Loading Terms 

The following off-street parking and loading terms, when used in this Article, shall have the meanings defined in this Section: 

8.2.1. ACCESS BOUNDARY That portion of the parking area that consists of a travel lane bounded on either side by an area that is 
not part of the parking area. 

8.2.2. BR Bedroom or guest accommodations. 

8.2.3. DU Dwelling unit. 

8.2.4. EMPLOYEE The maximum number of persons employed at the facility regardless of the time period during which this occurs

8.2.14. SF Square feet 

8.2.15. STACKING SPACE An off-street space for the temporary stacking of vehicles with an aisle intended to serve a drive-in teller 
window, take-out food window, dry cleaning/laundry pick-up or similar type activity station. 

 
§8.3. Required Off-street Parking Spaces 

Unless otherwise provided for, all uses shall conform with the minimum parking space requirements outlined in Table 8.3.1 
and Table 8.3.4. In situations where the required number of parking spaces is not readily determinable by Table 8.3.1 or Table 
8.3.4, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the parking space requirements using the table as a guide. 

8.3.1. Shared parking for mixed-use developments. Subject to approval by the Commission, minimum parking requirements for a 
mixed-use development may be reduced by calculation of shared parking requirements for the development utilizing the 
shared parking demand information in Table 8.3.2 and the Worksheet shown in Figure 8.3.2. These parking reductions shall 
not be available to lodging or residential uses unless such uses are part of a development also including non-lodging, non- 
residential uses. 



Article 8 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 

103

2. The development plan mitigates vehicular traffic impacts by proposing limited access to and from public streets. 

3. The development plan proposes the creation of new or upgraded sidewalks to help foster non-vehicular accessibility. 

8.3.2. Off-street Parking Design Requirements 

1. The minimum Parking Space dimensions shall be as shown in Table 8.3.3. 

2. In large parking areas of twenty (20) or more parking spaces, up to twenty (20) percent of the Parking Spaces may be 
reserved for compact cars. Such spaces shall contain a minimum rectangular area of eight (8) ft width and sixteen (16) ft 
length. These spaces shall be conspicuously marked for compact cars only. 

3. Stacking Space shall contain a minimum rectangular area of ten (10) ft in width and twenty (20) ft in length and be separated 
from parking aisles and spaces. 

4. Handicapped Parking Spaces shall be provided and designed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Standard 
Building Code, 1994, Chapter 11, and as such may be amended with regard to Accessibility for the Physically Disabled 
and/or Handicapped. 

5. Parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement 
does not apply to parking areas that serve one (1) or two (2) dwelling units; although, backing into arterials shall be 
prohibited.

Parking Dimensions Illustration 
 

7. Parking areas for all developments shall be so designed that sanitation, emergency and other public service vehicles can 
adequately and safely serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other 
dangerous maneuvers. Fire lanes may be required by the Fire Code. 

8. All parking areas shall be surfaced with dust-free materials (asphalt or concrete). 

9. Parking spaces [except those serving one (1) or two (2) dwelling units] shall be demarcated with painted lines or other 
markings. 

10. All parking areas shall be maintained in good condition, i.e. free of pot holes, weeds, trash, refuse, etc. 

11. Drainage in parking areas shall direct storm water back into the site from adjacent properties toward adequate drainage 
channels. Parking areas of twenty (20) or more spaces shall provide on-site storm water detention to retard the sudden 
discharge of high volumes of storm water into the public drainage system. The quantity and rate of runoff after development 
shall not exceed the quantity and rate of runoff before development, based on a twenty-five year (25) storm frequency. 
Drainage plans shall be subject to approval by both the Commission and the City Engineer. 

8.3.3. Location of Required Parking. All required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use served by the parking, 
except as provided below: 

1. Required parking within planned residential developments may be provided in common parking areas. 

2. If the number of required parking spaces cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot as the served use, satellite parking 
may within 400 ft of the nearest public entrance to the building housing the principal use. If the use is not housed within a 
building, satellite parking spaces shall be located within 400 ft of the lot. A satellite parking exception requires written legal 
documentation that the user of such satellite spaces has the right to such spaces. 

3. A joint parking area may contain required parking spaces for more than one (1) use, provided the combined number of 
spaces complies with the parking for all uses. If, however, the combined uses wish to make use of the same spaces at 
different times, the same spaces may be credited to each separate use. The applicant for a, combined use facility must 
present documentation of a combined parking agreement; and, if sharing the same spaces, a time schedule for allocation of 
such spaces. 

8.3.4. Parking Prohibitions 

1. The keeping of an inoperative motor vehicle in a residential district shall be within a fully enclosed building or structure or be 
completely screened or shielded from public view. Moreover, no inoperative motor vehicle shall be parked on any public 
street. 

2. No vehicle exceeding 7,500 pounds gross weight shall be kept within a residential district.

Article 9 LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS 

 
The intent of this Article is to require a minimum number of trees in residential areas, to establish standards for buffers required 
between incompatible land uses and to provide for landscaping surrounding and within vehicular areas in high traffic corridors. 
For the purposes of this Article, “fences” and “walls” shall have the same meaning. Landscaping shall not be planted in a manner 
or location which causes a hazard to vehicles entering or within the public right-of-way. 

 
§9.1. Landscaping for Dwellings 

The following standards shall apply to the construction of single family and two family dwellings and the placement of 
manufactured homes. 

9.1.1. Prior to issue of a Certificate of Occupancy for a single family dwelling, two family dwelling, manufactured home, on a lot that is 
100 ft or less in width, the owner shall plant at least one shade tree in the front or side yards and at least two shade trees in the 
rear yard. 

9.1.2. Prior to issue of a Certificate of Occupancy for a single family dwelling, two family dwelling, manufactured home, on a lot that is 
more than 100 ft in width, the owner shall plant at least three (3) shade trees in the front or side yards and at least two shade 
trees in the rear yard. 

9.1.3. Only shade trees listed in Table 9.1 may be counted toward the requirements of this Section. 

9.1.4. Existing trees which are at least six (6) inches in diameter may be used toward meeting the requirements of Table 9.1, if the 
area within the drip line of the trees has been left in its natural condition and no filling, grading, excavation, or parking of 
vehicles or equipment, or other activity which could damage or kill the tree, has occurred within the dripline of said existing 
trees. 

 
§9.2. Buffers 

This section is not applicable to the B-3 and MXD Districts. 

Buffers shall be provided in accord with the requirements of Table 9.2 and as described in this §9.2. 

9.2.1. Applicability. A Landscaping Plan shall be provided in accordance with §9.6. Except as otherwise provided herein, Buffers shall 
be required based on the developing land use and the existing, abutting use, regardless of the zoning districts in which they 
are located. 

 

Buffer Illustration 

9.2.2. General Standards. In order to decrease incompatibility between neighboring land uses, the following standards shall apply to 
all required buffers: whether the buffer is comprised of planted, natural, or a combination of planted and natural vegetation. 

1. Required yards, where corresponding with the buffer area, may overlap and may be counted toward a buffer width 
requirement. 

2. 100 percent of the applicable buffer requirement shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, except when the 
developing use will abut an existing more intensive use established prior to the adoption of these standards and for which no 
buffer is in place. In this case, the approving authority may require up to fifty (50) percent of the required buffer width on the 



Article 9 LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS 

113 

 

 

 

developing site. In such case, the applicant shall only be required to preserve existing vegetation within the buffer width or 
replace such vegetation with equivalent landscaping. 

3. Any required buffer abutting a park or greenway may be reduced, if the owner dedicates land to be set aside for all or part of 
the required buffer width to the City for incorporation into the park or greenway. Such land dedication shall be deemed 
acceptable only upon approval of the Council. 

4. Buffer requirements may be modified by the approving authority in certain cases as follows (See also §9.7 Modification or 
Waiver): 

a. When the proposed use will abut an existing, nonconforming use on a property that is designated for another use in 
the Comprehensive Plan and is zoned accordingly with said plan, the Buffer may be modified to be consistent with 
the projected use of the neighboring land. 

b. If the land use relationships between two abutting lots changes so that a lesser Buffer would be required, the width of 
the previously provided Buffer may be reduced accordingly. 

c. Up to one-half (1/2) of the width of an abutting alley may be counted toward the buffer width requirement but the 
landscaping density requirements shall not be reduced. 

d. Whenever the proposed use abuts vacant land, buffer requirements shall be based on the zoning of the abutting 
property or the use projected by the Comprehensive Plan, whichever requires a lesser buffer. 

e. Golf courses, playfields, stables, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other recreational facilities; parking and other 
vehicular use areas; buildings, dumpsters, and outdoor storage are prohibited in required Buffers. The approving 
authority may permit a pedestrian access way through a required Buffer, to allow access between the abutting uses, 
if desired. Public utilities and storm drainage facilities may be constructed in a required buffer, provided the buffer is 
installed in compliance with the approved Landscaping Plan. The City may require supplemental evergreen plantings 
in order to mitigate the effect of land disturbance in the buffer. 

9.2.3. Design Standards 

1. Prior to occupancy of the building or premises, the buffer shall provide a visually impervious barrier, uniformly dense at all 
heights from the ground, and a minimum of five (5) ft above grade throughout the entire length of the buffer. Within one year 
after installation the buffer shall be at least six (6) ft above grade throughout the entire length of the buffer. The buffer shall 
be comprised of vegetation which meets or exceeds these minimum standards throughout the calendar year. 

2. In the case of planted buffers, the entire surface area of the buffer shall be planted as prescribed in this Section. Only 
evergreen plant materials may be planted within a required buffer. Trees shall be provided as required in accordance with 
Table 9.2. 

3. The required Buffer width may be reduced as provided in Table 9.2 when a fence is provided that is 5-7 ft tall and that meets 
the requirements in §9.5. However, this shall not waive or reduce planting requirements. 

 

§9.3. Landscaping for Vehicular Areas 

This section is not applicable to the B-3 District. 

9.3.1. Applicability. These regulations apply to any off-street parking area containing more than forty (40) parking spaces and the 
vehicular areas of any developments, which are located within or visible from a high traffic corridor, as defined by this 
Ordinance. For the purposes of this section, vehicular areas shall include: off-street parking and loading; vehicular storage, 
display, maneuvering and washing; and the dispensing of motor fuels. 

9.3.2. A Landscaping Plan shall be required as part of every zoning application, Special Exception or Conditional Use application, 
Variance application and Building Permit application for new construction which includes vehicular areas as herein described. 
This Section shall apply to new vehicular areas for all uses, except single family dwellings, two family dwellings and 
manufactured homes. If the size of an existing vehicular area is increased by ten (10) percent or more, the new vehicular area 
shall be made to comply with the requirements of this Section; except that landscaping in the existing vehicular area shall be 
exempt from the irrigation requirement. 

9.3.3. Interior Vehicular Area Landscaping Requirements 

1. Each vehicular area shall have interior landscaping covering not less than five (5) percent of the total vehicular area. Such 
landscaping shall be in addition to all planting within six (6) ft of a building. 



ZONING ORDINANCE City of Calera, Alabama 

114 

 

 

 

2. In addition, a five (5) ft wide landscaping strip shall be provided along the parking lot perimeter and shall be planted with 
evergreen shrubs ( and shade trees (1 per 40 linear ft). Where this overlaps or conflicts with other landscaping requirements, 
the greater requirement shall govern. 

3. The primary landscaping materials used in vehicular areas shall be trees, which comply with the standards of Table 9.1. 
Shrubs and other planting materials may be used to compliment the tree planting, but shall not be the sole component of the 
landscaping. 

4. The interior dimensions of any planting area shall be sufficient to protect all landscaping materials planted therein. 

9.3.4. Perimeter Landscaping Requirements adjacent to Public Rights-of-Way 

1. Only trees listed in Table 9.1 shall be counted toward these requirements. 

2. A landscaped strip at least ten (10) ft wide, which shall not include a sidewalk or trail, shall be located between the vehicular 
area and the public right-of-way, except where driveways cross the property line. The width may be reduced to five (5) ft 
when a fence, meeting the requirements of §9.5 and that is between 2.5-3.5 ft tall, is provided. 

3. The entire width of the strip shall be planted with a double staggered row of shrubs. The shrubs shall be evergreen and a 
minimum of thirty (30) inches high at installation. 

4. At least one tree for every thirty (30) linear ft of required landscape strip, or portion thereof, shall be planted in the landscape 
strip. 

 
 

Table 9.1 Tree List

§9.4. Screening 

Screening is intended to provide visual separation of certain uses from public areas and adjoining properties. 



ZONING ORDINANCE City of Calera, Alabama 

116 

 

 

 

9.4.1. Applicability. For all multi-family, non-residential and mixed use developments, the following shall require Screening: 

1. Garbage collection, recycling and refuse handling areas. 

2. Maintenance areas or utility structures associated with a building or development. 

3. Water meters, gas meters, electric meters and air conditioners/mechanical units. 

4. Loading areas. 

5. Outside runs for pet services, animal shelters, and kennels. 

6. Outdoor storage of materials, stock, equipment, and vehicles (such as those stored for repair). 

7. Any other uses for which screening may be required by the reviewing authority. 

8. Open parking areas must be screened from the street by a building or streetscreen. 
 

Screening Illustration 

9.4.2. Safety Provisions. Screening shall not impede or divert the flow of water in any drainage way and shall not block access to any 
above-ground, pad-mounted transformer and shall provide the minimum clear distance required by the utility company. 

9.4.3. Design Requirements. The design of screening shall be in accord with the following and as approved by the reviewing 
authority: 

1. Location on site should be the first consideration in screening the uses listed in §9.4.1 above. The reviewing authority may 
lessen screening requirements when the location of the use to be screened reduces its visibility or other impact to the public 
and neighboring properties. 

2. The method of screening, including height and materials, shall be that which is sufficient to visually screen the use. The 
minimum height needed is preferred. 

3. Fences, berms, or landscaping used for other purposes, but that are proposed as part of a required screen and that meet the 
requirements of this Section, may count toward these requirements. 

4. Uses requiring screening, when co-located, may be screened together. 

5. Uses that produce objectionable noise or odors shall be located so as to minimize such impacts to the public and abutting 
properties. 

6. Shrubs shall be evergreen and spaced no more than five (5) ft on center. If used in combination with a fence, shrubs may be 
deciduous and may be spaced no more than eight (8) ft on center. 

7. Trees shall be evergreen and, when used in the absence of a fence, should have a low understory and/or be used together 
with shrubs to provide a continuous, opaque screen. 

8. A streetscreen must have openings no wider than the driveway or sidewalk plus a setback of 18 inches at driveway 
intersections. 



Article 9 LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS 

117 

 

 

 

9. Streetscreen materials are limited to the following: brick, stone, stucco over masonry, iron, steel or aluminum that appears to 
be iron. Non-opaque streetscreens require evergreen planting behind to provide opacity. 

9.4.4. Requirements for specific uses. 

1. Refuse and recycling containers shall not be located forward of the front building line. Such containers shall be screened by 
a combination of opaque fence and plant material on three (3) sides. Opaque gates, designed to complement the screen, 
shall be installed for access. The fence shall be at least two (2) ft taller than the container. 

2. For restaurants, enclosures shall be sized, as needed, to accommodate the storage of grease containers. 

3. Mechanical equipment on roofs or on site shall be screened so as to not be visible from public streets or adjacent properties. 
The screening of building-mounted mechanical equipment shall be an integral component of the building design. Mechanical 
equipment installed on site shall be adequately screened by plant materials and/or fences to blend in with site landscaping. 

4. Outdoor storage, where permitted, shall be screened to a height of six (6) ft or two (2) ft taller than the material or equipment 
to be screened, whichever is greater. 

5. Service areas, loading docks, work yards, and similar uses should be located to minimize their visibility to the public and to 
any abutting properties to which such functions would be objectionable. Where their location is insufficient to effectively 
screen the use, required screening shall be at least six (6) ft in height. 

 
§9.5. Design Standards for Fences 

Fences used as a part of any required Buffer, Screen, or Perimeter Landscaping shall comply with the following: 

9.5.1. Fences shall be of masonry, durable wood, or a combination thereof. Untreated wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be 
permitted. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface shall be left open. The finished side of the fence shall 
face abutting property. 

9.5.2. Required shrubs and trees shall be planted on the exterior side of the fence. 

9.5.3. If a fence is longer than 100 ft in one direction, it shall have columns of wood or masonry which project outward from the fence 
surface. Such columns shall be spaced no greater than fifty (50) ft on center. 

 
§9.6. Landscaping Plan 

A Landscaping Plan shall be required as part of every zoning application, Special Exception or Conditional Use application, 
Variance application and Building Permit application for new construction which requires a buffer, screening and/or landscaping 
in vehicular areas. The Landscape Plan shall be drawn to a scale no larger than one inch equals fifty (50) ft and shall contain 
the following information: 

9.6.1. The location and dimension of all areas proposed for landscaping and planting, including a description of the proposed plant 
materials. 

9.6.2. All dimensions and distances, property lines, easements, rights-of-way and buffers. 

9.6.3. Existing and proposed buildings and structures, including signs, trash and garbage containers, utility and drainage structures. 

9.6.4. Existing and proposed buildings and structures on the subject property and on adjacent property affected by the required 
buffer. When the finished floor elevation of buildings on the subject property differs by ten (10) ft or more from the finished floor 
elevation of the buildings on the adjacent property affected by the buffer, the plan shall include a cross section which 
accurately shows the comparative elevations of the buildings in relationship to the buffer. 

9.6.5. Bodies of water including water detention and retention areas. 

9.6.6. Driveways, vehicular areas, existing and proposed parking spaces, access aisles and other vehicular areas. 

9.6.7. Sufficient information and detail to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Section. 

 
§9.7. Modification or Waiver 

The planting requirements of this Article shall be applied equally to similarly classified and situated properties, but may be 
modified or waived altogether in certain cases where a building site is subject to any of the following circumstances determined 
by the Planning Commission: 



ZONING ORDINANCE City of Calera, Alabama 

118 

 

 

 

9.7.1. Existing natural vegetation, which meets, in whole or in part, buffer or screening requirements, may be applied toward the 
requirements of this Article. Where natural vegetation (trees and/or shrubs) exist on a piece of property, when application is 
made for a Building Permit, such natural vegetation shall be left undisturbed until the Zoning Administrator has evaluated it with 
regard to its suitability as a buffer or screen, as applicable. The Zoning Administrator may require that the developer retain a 
portion of the natural vegetation, where such already exists, rather than require a man-made planting strip or other methods of 
buffering or screening. However, additional planting may be required to achieve the requirement. 

9.7.2. Where impending development of adjacent property would make these standards unreasonable or impractical. 

9.7.3. Where, after inspection by the City, it is found that the view from adjoining properties is blocked by a change in grade or other 
natural or man-made features. 

9.7.4. Where planting cannot, in the professional opinion of an expert, be expected to thrive due to poor soil conditions, intense 
shade or similar conditions. 

9.7.5. In special cases where the side and/or rear yards may be inadequate to meet the landscaping requirements, the Planning 
Commission shall determine, based upon site plan review or other pertinent information requested, an alternative method of 
buffering, screening or other landscaping as applicable. 

 
§9.8. Maintenance and Irrigation 

9.8.1. All plantings required in this Article shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition by the party or parties required 
to provide such plantings and, when necessary, replaced with new growth. All fencing shall be permanently maintained in good 
condition and whenever necessary, repaired or replaced by the party or parties required to provide such fence. 

9.8.2. All plant material shall be tended and maintained in a healthy growing condition, replaced when dead and kept free of weeds, 
refuse and debris. 

9.8.3. All landscaping required in this Article 9 shall be drought-tolerant, native species or shall be irrigated by an automatic irrigation 
system.
