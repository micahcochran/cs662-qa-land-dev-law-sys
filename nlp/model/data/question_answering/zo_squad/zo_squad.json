This chapter contains provisions for the application, enforcement and administration of subsequent requirements of the code. In addition to establish- ing the scope of the code, Chapter 1 identifies which buildings and structures come under its pur- view. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with maintaining “due process of law” in enforcing the zoning criteria contained in the body of the code. Only through careful observation of the administrative provisions can the building official reasonably expect to demonstrate that “equal protection under the law” has been provided. Chapter 2 Definitions. All terms that are defined in the code are listed alphabetically in Chapter 2. While a defined term may be used in one chapter or another, the meaning provided in Chapter 2 is applicable throughout the code. Additional definitions regarding signs are found in Chapter 10. These are not listed in Chapter 2. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” vii  viii Where understanding of a term’s definition is especially key to or necessary for understanding of a particular code provision, the term is shown in italics wherever it appears in the code. This is true only for those terms that have a meaning that is unique to the code. In other words, the generally understood meaning of a term or phrase might not be sufficient or consistent with the meaning pre- scribed by the code; therefore, it is essential that the code-defined meaning be known. Guidance regarding tense, gender and plurality of defined terms as well as guidance regarding terms not defined in this code is provided. Chapter 3 Use Districts. Chapter 3 identifies classifications for typical zoning districts and pro- vides for the application of minimum district areas, in order to regulate and restrict the locations for uses and locations of buildings designated for specific areas and to regulate the minimum required areas or yards and courts and important open-areas property. This chapter also requires coordination of the established zoning districts with approved zoning maps. Further, this chapter also contains information on the minimum requirements for conditional use areas, which includes particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, estab- lished or intended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. Chapter 3, along with Chapters 4 through 7 establish the criteria to classify properties into com- patible use districts. Chapter 4 Agricultural Zones. Chapter 4 identifies three divisions of agricultural zones includ- ing any area to be designated as open space, agricultural uses and land used for public parks and similar uses. After the specific zoning areas are established, this chapter provides minimum bulk zoning regulations to establish lot area, structure-to-open space density, lot dimensions, and set- back and building height requirements. For example, within an agricultural zone 2 there is a limit of one dwelling unit per 10 acres with a minimum lot area of 10 acres. Lot dimensions are required to be 400 feet wide by 400 feet deep minimum for this parcel of ground. Chapter 5 Residential Zones. The objective of Chapter 5 is to define residential uses for a juris- diction to utilize in arranging compatible land uses in order to achieve the maximum social and eco- nomic benefit for the community. This chapter identifies three divisions of residential zones including single-family, two-family and multiunit residential uses. Once the particular zones are established, provisions for the minimum bulk zoning regulations, such as lot area, structure-to- Open-space density, lot dimensions, setback and building height requirements, are indicated. For example, based on Table 502.1, a Division 2b residential lot would restrict the overall building height to 35 feet and establish a minimum front yard of 15 feet, side yard of 5 feet, and rear yard of 20 feet while requiring a minimum overall lot size of 6,000 square feet. Chapter 6 Commercial and Commercial/Residential Zones. Chapter 6 identifies four divi- sions of commercial zones, including C1, which includes minor automotive repair and automotive fuel dispensing facilities; C2, which includes light commercial and group care facilities; C3, which includes amusement centers including bowling alleys, golf driving ranges, miniature golf courses, ice skating rinks, pool and billiard halls; and C4, which includes major automotive repair, manufacturing and commercial centers. This chapter also contains two divisions of commercial/residential zones that accommodate residential uses in light and medium commercial zones (Divisions 1 and 2). Once the particular zones are established, Chapter 6 provides specific minimum bulk zoning restrictions to include lot area, structure-to-open-space density, lot dimensions, and setback and building height requirements. Chapter 7 Factory/Industrial Zones. The objective of Chapter 7 is to define factory/industrial uses for a jurisdiction to utilize in arranging compatible land uses for the social and economic wel- fare of the community. This chapter identifies three divisions of factory/industrial zones including a range of factory/industrial zones from light manufacturing or industrial, such as warehouses and auto body shops (Division 1), to heavy manufacturing or industrial, such as automotive dismantling and petroleum refineries (Division 3). Once the particular zones are established, Chapter 7 provides minimum bulk zoning regulations that establish lot area, structure-to-open-space density, lot dimensions, and setback and building height requirements. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  Chapter 8 General Provisions. Chapter 8 contains general zoning provisions along with require- ments for elements that are common to most uses recognized by this code, to include parking stall dimensions, driveway width requirements, allowable projections into required yard spaces, land- scaping and loading space size requirements. This chapter also establishes the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for specific uses, fence height requirements specific to front, side and rear yard locations, accessory buildings and minimum separation distance requirements from accessory buildings to the main building on the same lot, maximum allowable projection encroach- ment into the required front and rear yards, and landscaping requirements for new buildings and additions and maintenance requirements for existing landscaping. Chapter 8 also provides for the jurisdiction to specifically review and approve the availability of essential services infrastructure for all new projects with a focus on sewer, potable water, street lighting and fire hydrants. Chapter 9 Special Regulations. Chapter 9 recognizes two unique uses, home office and adult- use businesses, and establishes requirements to address each based on their characteristics and potential impact related to other uses/zoning districts. With respect to home occupations, Chapter 9 contains restrictions that include maximum allowable floor area for both the home occupation and the storage for same, exterior display and patron and parking allowances. With respect to adult uses, Chapter 9 requires adult uses to obtain a conditional-use permit and contains a list of four specific location requirements for adult uses. Chapter 10 Sign Regulations. The primary purpose of Chapter 10 is to establish the regulation for the use of signs and sign structures. This chapter addresses the various sign types, provides numerous figures that show examples of general signs, roof signs, wall signs and fascia signs, and addresses the computation methodology of sign area for code compliance. Chapter 10 also contains the general provisions that apply to sign placement, maintenance, repair and removal, as well as requirements for wall, free-standing, directional and temporary signs. Chapter 11 Nonconforming Structures and Uses. Chapter 11 contains provisions for noncon- forming structures and uses regulated under this code. The primary purpose of this chapter is to ensure that existing structures and current land use practices legally established prior to the adop- tion of the International Zoning Code are allowed to be continued. This chapter also describes the criteria that a nonconforming structure or use must meet in order to be allowed to be maintained unchanged. Specific criteria is provided for the discontinuance of a nonconforming use to include vacancy and damage. Chapter 11 also describes the restrictions on enlargements and modifications to a nonconforming structure.   Chapter 12 Conditional Uses. Chapter 12 establishes the requirements for conditional uses based on the occasional need for a use not normally permitted in a particular zoning district and due to the unique characteristics and service that use provides to the public. This chapter contains requirements for conditional use permits, minimum documentation required to support a condi- tional use property, and fees. Further, Chapter 12 establishes the criteria for expiration and revoca- tion of conditional use permit and includes a provision that allows the applicant to submit an amendment to a conditional use permit. Chapter 13 Planned Unit Development. Chapter 13 identifies the code requirements for planned unit developments and describes the important role of the planning commission. The pri- mary purpose of this chapter is to permit and encourage diversification, variation, and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic development with relationship to public services, and to encourage and facilitate the preservation of open lands. This chapter contains the specific condi- tions for planned unit developments, including area, uses, ownership and open space requirements. Chapter 14 Referenced Standards. The code contains numerous references to standards that are used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 14 contains a comprehensive list of all standards that are referenced in the code. The standards are part of the code to the extent of the referenced standard. Compliance with the referenced standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with the code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and available on an equal basis to the code official, contractor, designer and owner. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE” ix  This chapter is organized to facilitate locating specific standards, by listing all of the referenced standards, alphabetically, by acronym of the promulgating agency of the standard. Each agency’s standards are then listed in either alphabetical or numeric order based upon the standard identifi- cation. The list also contains the title of the standard; the edition (date) of the standard referenced; any addenda included as part of the ICC adoption; and the section or sections of this code that ref- erenced the standard. 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  LEGISLATION The Jnternational Codes are designed and promulgated to be adopted by reference by legislative action.

Any territory hereafter annexed shall automatically, upon such annexation, be classified as R, Divi- sion la, residential district, and be subject to all conditions and regulations applicable to property in such district. SECTION 305 CONDITIONAL USES 305.1 General. The principal objective of this zoning code is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible build- ings and land uses, and for the property location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various use districts established by this code. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each dis- trict, there are certain additional uses which it may be neces- sary to allow because of the unusual characteristics of the service they provide the public. These conditional uses require particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, established or intended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and operation of such special uses are established by the applicable sections of this code. 13  14 2012 INTERNATIONAL ZONING CODE”  uses shall be: SECTION 401 AGRICULTURAL ZONES DEFINED 401.1 Agricultural zone.
