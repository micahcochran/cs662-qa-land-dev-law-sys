It is the  intent of this Section that the site plan and design review process be a part of the building permit  application process, and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the  site will be constructed and inspected prior to occupancy of the development.
1002.01.
Development Requiring Site Plan Approval.
Prior to issuance of a zoning  certificate, site plan approval and design review shall be required for all proposed non-residential  construction and residential development types described in Sections 603.03 (E) and (F).
This  shall include clubhouses or other ancillary facilities within a residential subdivision.
Site plan  approval shall also be required for the subdivision of an existing development site of a type  subject to site plan requirements, and/or an expansion, reduction or reconfiguration of any such  development type.
For any proposal in which these requirements are unclear, the Planning  Director shall determine whether site plan approval is necessary.
(See Section 1002.09 C for  Conditional Uses)     1002.02.  Review of Site Plans.
Site plans submitted for review shall be approved, disapproved,  or referred to the Planning Commission.
The staff shall establish regular site plan review  meetings at least two (2) times each month at which both pre-design conferences and formal  reviews will take place.
When a site plan is disapproved, the reason(s) for the disapproval shall     May 10, 2021   X-2   be provided in writing to the applicant within ten (10) days of the hearing at which the decision  to disapprove was made.
In approving a site plan, any request for waivers from the requirements of this Ordinance shall be  taken to the Planning Commission for consideration as provided in Section 1002.04.
Variance  requests shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Adjustment as set out in Section 1108.
The following criteria shall be used in determining whether to approve a site plan:     A.  Completeness of application information as required under Section 1002.12;    B.
Consistency with adopted policies and standards of the Major Streets and Long Range  Utilities Plans;    C.  Uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this Ordinance;    D.  Whether the site plan meets applicable design standards established by this  Ordinance;    E.  Availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development, such  as roads, sewer, water, schools, solid waste disposal, and fire protection (including access  to the site for emergency vehicles); and    F.  Compatibility with surrounding land uses (this criterion shall apply only where a site  plan proposes a conditional use pursuant to Section 1003).
The Planning Director and/or City Engineer may refer any site plan proposal to the Planning  Commission.
1002.03.
Waiver of Selected Development Standards – Approval By Planning Commission.
Specific development standards that may be modified with Planning Commission Approval are  limited to the following:       • bufferyards, including width, planting and required structures; and   • general and off-street parking landscaping requirements  • minor parking adjustments (in instances of redevelopment)  • façade treatments (in instances where buildings in the immediate vicinity are of like   design)       This may be done only upon a specific finding by the Planning Commission that such  requirements are inappropriate as applied to a particular development site due to its size,  proposed use, and/or location, and that a waiver would not conflict with the intent of this  Ordinance or confer upon any property owner a right or privilege denied to neighboring property  owners within the same district.
May 10, 2021   X-3   1002.04.
Pre-design Review.
A pre-application conference shall be required for each site plan  to be submitted.
At that time the staff will provide the applicant or their representative with  advice and guidance regarding the requirements of this Ordinance, and any other regulations  which apply.
Preliminary sketches shall be reviewed and overall development concepts finalized  at this time.
At the pre-design conference, the applicant shall provide the planning department with basic  information regarding the proposal.
This information should form the basis upon which the staff  may advise the applicant on the subsequent steps required to gain final site plan approval and the  necessary information which will be submitted with the formal application.
All requests for waivers or variances should be submitted to the planning department at the pre- design conference whenever possible.
Upon request, the planning department may waive  specific site and architectural plan form or information requirements as set forth in this article.
The planning department may waive any requirement of site plans and architectural plans if it is  determined that specific requirements are unnecessary due to circumstances unique to the  property, or if the requirements have been previously submitted and approved.
Such  requirements may be set aside only to the extent that the intent and purposed of this ordinance  are not violated.
It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to allow for plenty of time for the pre-application  conference, and any other available guidance, in order to have a complete application package  submitted and formal review completed before their desired construction start date.
1002.05.
Formal Submission.
Five (5) folded copies of the site plan, a completed application  form, a landscape plan and all other necessary attachments, as well as the requisite application  fees shall be submitted to the Planning Department to initiate processing of the site plan.
Additional plans shall be provided for review by appropriate state, regional and county agencies  upon staff request.
A.
Site Plan Preparation Requirements.
Proposed development site plans shall be  prepared and sealed by an architect, professional engineer or surveyor.
Full engineering  drawings must be submitted by an engineer registered in the State of Alabama.
The City  Engineer may choose to require additional information as necessary.
Sketch plans and drawings submitted with variance or other zoning-related applications  shall not be accepted for review as a site plan unless they are prepared in accordance with  the guidelines of this Section and contain all required information.
In all cases,  engineering plans addressing drainage, road construction and other technical aspects of  development design shall be sealed by a civil engineer registered in the State of Alabama.
B.  Completeness of Plans.
Site plans submitted without complete information in  accordance with Section 1002.12 shall not be reviewed by the Planning Staff or placed on  the Planning Commission Agenda.
May 10, 2021   X-4   C.  Staff Review.
The Planning Director and other appropriate city staff members shall  review the site plan with specific regard to this Ordinance and other regulations of the  City of Northport.
The staff review shall identify matters of development policy concern  to which the applicant shall address particular attention.
D.  Revised Plans.
Following submission of a complete application package for site plan  review the Planning staff shall have a minimum of 15 working days in which to complete  the review and approve the site plan.
1002.06.
Approval of Site Plans.
The planning department may approve, approve with  conditions or disapprove an application as submitted.
For all such applications that are  disapproved, the reasons for such disapproval shall be provided to the applicant in writing.
For  all applications that are approved with conditions, the planning department shall indicate the  nature of the conditions to the applicant in writing.
Except as stipulated in Section 1002.04, no  site plan shall be approved which is inconsistent with any term contained in this Ordinance  unless a waiver or variance has been granted in accordance with Sections 1002.03 or 1108 of this  Ordinance.
Upon approval of a site plan, a minimum of five (5) folded copies, and any additional copies as  may be required by the city, of the approved site plan shall be submitted to the Planning  Department prior to issuance of a zoning certificate.
The Planning Director shall stamp, sign and  date the site plan copies, then forward copies of the site plan to the Engineering and Building  Inspections Departments.
A minimum of two (2) copies of the site plan shall be reserved for the  use of the Planning Department.
1002.07.
Effect of Site Plan Approval.
Upon final approval of a site plan, no structures, uses,  or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development site except in accordance with  the site plan and related approved plans for development phasing, building construction, grading  drainage, and other site design elements.
Approved site plans shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval, and a zoning  certificate and building permit for the development may be obtained during that time period.
The Planning Director may make an extension of site plan approval for a single period up to six  (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire.
An extension may be granted  only if the Planning Director concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due  diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a  new application.
All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30  days before the expiration of the approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension  request.
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted.
Instead, the applicant  shall submit a new application for review according to the requirements of this Section.
Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction  drawings to the Engineering and Building Inspection Departments for permitting.
These shall     May 10, 2021   X-5   include, but are not limited to, detailed building plans, grading plans, drainage and stormwater  management facilities, erosion control plans, road and driveway construction specifications, and  tree removal plans.
Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Building Inspections Department from accepting for  review and processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical,  electrical, and plumbing systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions  as may be established by that department relative to processing of site plans prior to final  approval.
In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a  zoning certificate and the site plan has been stamped approved and is on file in the Building  Inspections Department.
All building and construction permits issued for any project requiring  site plan review shall be consistent with the stamped approved site plan.
The approval of a site  plan shall not under any circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the  applicable City requirements for construction or installation of structures or materials.
Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such construction details occurs, the more  restrictive, or that requiring the higher standard, shall prevail.
1002.08.
Modification or Termination of Site Plans.
A.
Site Plan Amendments.
After final approval, any modification, variation or  adjustment of a stamped approved site plan shall require approval of a site plan  amendment.
Upon approval of any amendment, the Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall stamp  and date the most recent version of the site plan, showing the approved amendment, and  mark all previous copies as “void”.
If appropriate, the Engineering and Building  Inspections Departments shall be notified of the amendment.
B.
Site Plan Expiration and Cancellation.
In the event of a change to these regulations  the site plan shall be valid under the regulations for which it was approved for 18 months  from the date of such approval.
Upon expiration of the site plan and any extension that  may have been granted, the Planning Director shall make appropriate records in the  Planning Department files stamp all available copies of the site plan as “void”, and notify  the Engineering and Building Inspections Departments of the expiration.
The applicant may cancel the site plan at any time between the date of final approval and  the date of expiration by submitting a written request to the Planning Director.
Upon  receipt of this request by the Planning Director, the site plan shall be treated as expired.
1002.09.
Integration of Other Review Procedures.
Any site plan to be built in stages or  requiring variance or conditional use approval shall be coordinated as set forth below:         May 10, 2021   X-6   A.
Development Built in Stages.
As part of the application for site plan approval, the  developer shall submit a proposed stage plan, including a schedule for completion of all  improvements.
If the site plan proposes any of the performance residential housing types  described in Section 603.02 (A) through (F), a Master Development Plan pursuant to  Section 604 shall also be required.
Once a stage plan has been approved, no land may be  used and no building may be occupied except in accordance with such plan.
At the  Planning Director’s discretion, a new site plan may be required for each successive stage  of the development.
Stage configurations shall be logical and consistent with the purposes of this Ordinance.
If appropriate, the Planning Director may stipulate that any or all portions of the required  landscaping and/or bufferyards be provided during the first stage of development, even  though some bufferyards or portions thereof lie outside the stage.
Each stage, at a  minimum, must include adequate parking, drainage facilities, landscaping, and all other  features needed to serve that portion of the total development.
Prior to approval for construction of any one stage, an engineering stage plan shall be  submitted to and approved by the City Engineer.
This plan shall address site grading,  erosion control, stormwater management, internal traffic circulation, and any other design  elements required by the City Engineer.
In approving a stage plan, the Planning Commission or Planning staff may specify certain  site improvements to be provided at a percentage rate exceeding that of construction of  the overall development.
These items may be elements of engineering design, or  requirements of this Ordinance.
Such improvements include, but are not limited to  parking, drainage facilities, erosion control measures, landscaping and bufferyards.
Where the applicant has agreed to provide off-site improvements, such as traffic signals,  turn lanes, and sewer lines, the Planning Commission or Planning Director may require  such improvements to be in place upon completion of any stage of the development.
B.  Variance.
Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this  Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted  upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment in accordance with Section 1108 of this  Ordinance.
This shall include existing development sites, proposed for expansion or  reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement of this Ordinance.
The site  plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the variance request, but  the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved.
C.  Conditional Uses.
For developments requiring approval of a conditional use, a  request for such approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission; and the  Commission shall make a recommendation to City Council on such request.
The Council  shall act on the conditional use request prior to final approval of the site plan.
A site plan  and a conditional use request may be processed concurrently.
1002.10.
Non-Compliance.
Failure to comply with a stamped approved site plan or any of the  conditions upon which such approval was contingent, including time limits for performance,     May 10, 2021   X-7   shall be cause to deny issuance of a zoning certificate or, where a zoning certificate has been  issued pursuant to a stamped approved site plan, to render such zoning certificate invalid.
Any  action, construction, development or use of property undertaken in violation of the provisions of  this Section for a site plan shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and may be subject to a  stop-work order.
1002.11.
Development Site To Be Unified.
A.
Internal Division of Ownership.
Except as provided in this section, the  development site shall remain unified by title under one (1) owner, or by multiple owners  holding a percentage interest in the site as a whole.
Where a development site consists of  two (2) or more existing lots under the same ownership, all such lots shall be combined in  accordance with the Subdivision Regulations prior to final approval of the site plan.
Where spatial division of ownership within a development site is proposed, the owners of  all component properties shall accept the following conditions in receiving site plan  approval:       1.
No individual property will be used or developed in any way that is not consistent   with the approved site plan.
2.
Development rights on each parcel are combined with those of the balance of the   development site, and the City will consider no separate development proposals  unless the development site can be divided in accordance with the provisions of  this Ordinance.
3.
No parcel of land within a development site shall be subdivided, sold or otherwise   conveyed for the purpose of new development that is not authorized under the  approved site plan.
All owners of property within the development site shall authorize one (1) person,  designated as the applicant, to represent them collectively before the Planning  Commission and other City officials in all matters related to the site plan and  development site.
In the event the designated applicant is not an owner of the subject  property then a notarized “Authorization to Act as Applicant” must be completed and  signed by the owner(s).
B.
External Ownership.
When the development site is part of a larger parcel of  property, of which a portion is not intended to be included within the site plan, this  unused area shall become a separate lot, meeting any relevant size and dimensional  requirements of this Ordinance, to be approved in accordance with the Subdivision  Regulations.
This subdivision process shall be completed prior to final approval of the  site plan.
C.  Development Site To Be Complete.
The development site shall be designed to  provide all required amenities and facilities, including bufferyards, open space, and     May 10, 2021   X-8   landscaping.
No such required features shall be located off-site or on adjacent properties  which are leased, rented, or otherwise proposed for use on an informal basis, except as  provided for in Section 611.03 Shared Parking.
The entire site shall have the zoning  designation required to accommodate the principal use.
D.  Division After Approval.
No development site, once granted site plan approval,  shall be divided except through the site plan amendment process established in Section  1002.08.
1002.12.

Design Review Standards.
A.
Site Standards.
The standards for site plans listed below are intended only as minimum  requirements, so that the general development pattern in the city may be adjusted to a wide  variety of circumstances and topography, and to ensure reasonable and orderly growth.
1.
All proposed development shall meet or exceed the city's most current  zoning   ordinance, subdivision regulations and any other city ordinance as may pertain to  such developments, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act.
May 10, 2021   X-17   2.
Applications shall state the estimated increase in vehicle trips per day to the subject  property which would be generated by the proposed development.
Further, the  applicant shall also provide for the necessary engineering studies needed to determine  that entrances and exits onto public streets do not unduly increase congestion or  traffic hazards to the public streets and the proposed site.
Such requirements for  engineering studies may be waived by the planning department where the proposed  use is not expected to contribute substantially to traffic and the spirit of this ordinance  is not unduly compromised.
Entrances, internal roads, and driveways shall be constructed to accommodate  anticipated traffic flows after the development is complete.
Preparation of plans and  specifications are the responsibility of the applicant.
Applicants may be required to install, at their own expense, turn lanes, street  intersection lights, signs, and other improvements necessary to handle the increased  traffic and potential traffic hazards.
3.
The proposed development shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of  the city's erosion control ordinance.
4.
Developers shall provide for fences, landscaping and other improvements as are   necessary to buffer the proposed use from the existing or surrounding land uses as set  forth in Article V, "Landscaping Requirements", of the zoning ordinance.
5.
Lighting facilities and lighted signs shall be placed and shielded in such a manner,   and of such a height and intensity, as not to cause direct light to shine on other  properties to the extent a public nuisance is created or a safety hazard is created on a  public street.
Lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the design objective of this  article.
6.
To the greatest extent possible, utilities should be placed underground, unless the   applicant can demonstrate that it is unfeasible due to the costs or other constraints.
7.
The proposed development shall be designed to prevent danger from fire, explosion,   or other safety hazards to the general public, and the persons residing or working on  surrounding property.
8.
Loading docks, garbage collection areas and similar facilities and functions should to   the greatest extent possible, be incorporated into the overall design of the building  and the landscaping, so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are  fully contained and are not visible from adjacent properties or public streets.
In the  event that the collection areas enclose dumpsters or other equipment, screening shall  be at least two feet taller than the equipment and not less than six feet in height.
Use  of screening materials should be consistent with the principal materials of the  building and landscaping.
May 10, 2021   X-18   9.
Applicants may be required to install, at their own expense, sidewalks and half-street  improvements as described in Section 618 of the Northport Subdivision Regulations  as deemed necessary by the Planning Director or City Engineer.
a. Fee-in-Lieu of Sidewalks.
1.
When one or more of the following conditions are present, the  developer may request approval from Planning Commission of a fee- in-lieu arrangement in the form of a waiver, whereby the developer  shall make a contribution toward the Sidewalk Trust Fund in lieu of  requiring installation of sidewalks:   a.
When the project site is not located on a priority pedestrian  corridor as designated by the most current regional bicycle  and pedestrian plan;   b.
When requesting a subdivision consisting of five or fewer  lots;   c. When there are no sidewalks currently installed on  adjoining properties;   d. When existing public infrastructure currently prohibits  construction of sidewalks as determined by the Public  Works Director and/or City Engineer;   e. When topography and/or terrain does not allow the  installation of ADA compliant sidewalks as determined by  a licensed civil engineer and agreed upon by the City  Engineer;   f. When other circumstances make sidewalk installation  unreasonable or inappropriate, as determined by the  Planning Director and/or City Engineer.
2.
Such fee-in-lieu arrangement shall be based on the total cost of  sidewalk installation, as determined by the City Engineer.
3.
The developer shall have the choice of either installing the sidewalks  or paying to the City the fee-in-lieu of such sidewalk installation,  prior to any certificate of occupancy being issued for structures in  any phase abutting the right-of-way within which the sidewalks are  required.
B.
Architectural standards.
The standards of this section are intended to promote the  health, safety and welfare of citizens by setting limited guidelines for construction with an  emphasis on aesthetics.
The guidelines may be supplemented or superseded by the planning  commission and/or city council by specific design guidelines applicable to specific uses or  portions of the city as set out herein.
1.
Height and massing.
a.   Shall conform to the height requirements of each district.
May 10, 2021   X-19     b.
Multifamily, commercial and office structures shall be designed to be compatible  and consistent with the architectural style and character of single family residential  structures in the immediate vicinity.
The exterior of multifamily structures may be  designed to appear as a single building, such as a large single family detached  dwelling.
c.   Lengthy unbroken facades should be avoided.
As a general guide, the maximum  horizontal length of an unbroken facade plane should be 50 feet in residential  districts, and 75 feet in commercial and office districts.
Facade offsets shall be  sufficient to create a strong shadow line.
d.   Buildings on corner lots shall be considered more significant structures, due to the  fact that they have at least two front facades visibly exposed to the street.
It is  strongly encouraged that such buildings be designed with additional height and  architectural embellishments, such as corner towers, relating to their location.
e.   Buildings should be located to front towards and relate to public streets, both  functionally and visually, to the greatest extent possible.
2.
Roofs.
a.
The pitch and style of roofs should be consistent with that of surrounding  structures.
Generally roofs should project enough beyond the facade to cast a shadow  and shall be of a color which would be consistent and compatible with the natural  environment.
b.
Architectural embellishments which add visual interest to roofs, such as dormers,  belvederes, masonry chimneys, cupolas, clock towers and other similar elements are  strongly encouraged.
c.   Mechanical equipment should be concealed from public streets within the volume  of the roof or enclosed within penthouse structures or screening that will substantially  eliminate visibility of the equipment from public streets.
3.
Facades.
a.
Front facades should be architecturally emphasized through fenestration, entrance  treatments and details.
Architectural elements such as doorways, dormers, gables, and  porches should be used to effectively articulate facades and reduce the scale of larger  structures.
Diverse architectural treatments should be integrated to avoid a cluttered  appearance.
May 10, 2021   X-20   b.
The architectural treatment of the front facade should be continued, in its major  features, around all sides of a building that are visible from a public street.
It is  recommended that all sides of a building should be architecturally designed to be  consistent with regard to style, materials, colors and details.
Blank wall or service  area treatment of side and/or rear elevations, visible from a public street is  discouraged.
c.   Fenestration should be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, color  and details of the building.
Windows should be vertically proportioned wherever  possible.
To the greatest extent possible, upper story windows should be vertically  aligned with the location of windows and doors on the ground level, including  storefront or display windows.
d.   Blank, windowless walls are discouraged.
If necessitated by local building codes,  the wall should be articulated by the provision of blank window openings trimmed  with frames, sills and lintels.
e.   Each principal commercial building should have a highly visible customer  entrance.
All entrances to a building should be defined and articulated by  architectural elements such as lintels, pediments, pilasters, columns, porticos,  porches, overhangs, railings, balustrades and other similar elements.
Any such  element utilized should be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors  and details of the building as a whole, including the doors.
4.
Materials.
Materials such as brick, stone and wood are preferred.
Developers are   encouraged to vary materials from building to building while limiting the number of different  materials on any individual structure.
In all instances the use of loud, garish colors on  exterior façade materials shall be prohibited.
Metal siding shall be prohibited on all sides of  a building which are visible from any public street except under the following conditions:     Metal siding shall be allowed in industrial zones only (M-1 or M-2) for buildings under   the following conditions:  • A minimum base of four feet or 30% of wall height, whichever is greater, of brick,   stone, split face block, or other durable material (not smooth finish concrete masonry units or  smooth concrete) shall be located on the sides facing a public street; if a multi-story building,  the first story must meet this material requirement   • No exterior wall plane facing a public street may exceed thirty feet without an  interruption or articulation.
Examples include: wall offsets, material changes, pilasters,  columns/posts, roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches.
• If an industrial zone is located adjacent to a residential zone, the front or main façade  shall not have any metal siding (architectural metal panels are allowed).
Architectural metal panels shall be allowed in commercial zones (C-2, C-3, or C-6) under   the following conditions:  • A minimum base of four feet or 30% of wall height, whichever is greater, of brick,   stone, split face block, or other durable material (not smooth finish concrete masonry units or     May 10, 2021   X-21   concrete) shall be located on all sides visible from a public street; if a multi-story building,  the first story must meet this material requirement   • No exterior wall plane visible from a public street may exceed thirty feet without an  interruption or articulation.
Examples include: wall offsets, material changes, pilasters,  columns/posts, roofline or cornice line changes, projecting bays, porches, fenestrations.

Conditional Uses.
Conditional uses are those uses that have some special impact which differs from the potential  impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have uniqueness such that their effect  on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a  particular location.
Upon submission of a request for conditional use approval, a review of the location, design,  configuration, and impact shall be conducted to determine whether the proposed use would have  a detrimental impact on neighboring properties.
The review considers the proposal in terms of:   • existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use;   • planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by   the proposed use;   • whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is   consistent with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and; any other development policies  and/or regulations of the City of Northport; and    • whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to  minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the  public health, safety, and welfare in general.
Section 1003.01.
Applicability.
Any use designated as a conditional use by Table 4-1 of this  Ordinance shall comply with this Section.
In addition, the following shall be approved only as conditional uses:       A.

As a courtesy, signs  announcing the public hearing may be placed on the property in question    C.  The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds that the application  and record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance.
Further, the  application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any  mitigating conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission, outweigh any  public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall  public health, safety, and welfare.
D.  In order to prevent or minimize adverse effects on other properties in the  neighborhood and on the general health, safety, and welfare of the City of Northport, the  Planning Commission may impose such restrictions and conditions on approval of the  proposed use as it determines are required by the general purposes, goals, and objectives  of this Ordinance.
All conditions imposed upon any conditional use permit approval,  except those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in  the resolution granting such conditional use permits.

The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue  adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions,  parking, public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the  public health, safety, and general welfare; either as they now exist or as they may in the  future be developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this  Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under  consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other governmental agency  having jurisdiction to guide growth and development.
C.  The proposed use will be adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden  on any of the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection.
Where any such improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or  adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part  of the application and as a condition to approval of the proposed conditional use permit,  be responsible for establishing ability, willingness, and bind commitment to provide such  improvements, facilities, utilities, and services in sufficient time and in a manner  consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, programs, maps, and ordinances adopted  by the City to guide its growth and development.
The approval of the conditional use  permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services  being provided and guaranteed by the applicant.
D.  The Planning Commission may attach to any recommendation for conditional use  approval, additional criteria dealing with bufferyards, parking, lighting, building  materials, or any other aspect of site plan approval they deem necessary to mitigate the  impact of the proposed conditional use on the surrounding property.
1003.05.
Conditional Use Approval to Run with Land.
Conditional use approvals are issued  for uses of land and may be transferable from one owner of the land to another.
All conditions  place on said approval, including specific use types, shall be applicable to any new owner or     May 10, 2021   X-24   developer.
Any change to plans or uses by any owner shall, at the recommendation of the  Planning Director, require re-approval through the normal approval process for Conditional Use.
1003.06.
Filling of Floodplain.

Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other  ordinances.
The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this  Ordinance.
Section 1005.
Certificate of Occupancy.
No land or building for which a zoning certificate has been issued shall be occupied or used in  whole or in part for any use whatsoever after the effective date of this Ordinance until the owner,  tenants, contract purchaser, or authorized agent thereof has been issued a certificate of  occupancy by the Chief Building Inspector, or his/her designee, indicating that the building or  use complies with all zoning requirements of this Ordinance, the building code, and other  applicable codes and regulations.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the premises in question have been inspected  and found by the Senior Building Inspector to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.

1106.05.
Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation.
No use interpretation finding a particular  use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific district shall authorize the  establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving  of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of  applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by the codes and ordinances  of the City of Northport, or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction.

Section 1107.
Amendments.
This Ordinance may be amended from time to time as conditions warrant in the following  manner.
As used herein, the term “application” includes City Council resolution/ordinance.
A.
Application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance or zoning map of the City of  Northport shall be made on forms furnished by the planning department, and shall  include a proper legal description of the subject lot or tract of land.
Additionally, all  required fees and any other graphic information requested by the Planning Director shall  be submitted along with the completed application.
B.  Initiation Procedures.
A proposed change to the zoning district boundaries or of the  regulations may be initiated by the City Council, the Northport Planning Commission, or  by petition of one or more owners, or authorized agents of such owners, of property  within the area proposed to be changed.
C.  Text Amendments.
The application for an amendment to the text of this Ordinance  shall state in particular the article, section, subsection, and paragraph sought to be  amended.
The application shall contain the language of the proposed amendment and  shall recite the reasons for such proposed change in the text.
D.  Map Amendments.
1.
Applications to rezone any property, or any application which seeks to change   or modify the standards and requirements imposed on a particular piece of     May 10, 2021   XI-9   property by the text and maps of this Ordinance, including applications for  variances and conditional use permits, may be instituted by the City of  Northport or all the owners of the property sought to be affected, or their  assigns.
2.
In the case where the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, said   applicant shall secure a notarized authorization to act as applicant from the  property owner, along with the regularly required copy of the deed for the  property.
3.
When a development proposal involves approval of a site plan or subdivision   plat in addition to a zoning map amendment, no site plan or subdivision plat  approval shall be granted prior to approval of the map amendment.
If a  development plan and the corresponding request for zoning change are to be  addressed at the same public hearing, the Planning Commission shall render a  decision on the zoning application before considering any related site plan or  subdivision plat.
Such decision shall be based on the requirements of the  Comprehensive Plan, this Ordinance and the full range of uses permitted in the  requested district, and not on the specific development concept proposed by the  applicant.
4.
All properties annexed into the City of Northport shall be classified as RS-1,   single-family residential, or such other district that is specifically requested by  the petitioner(s) in the annexation petition.
All requests for annexation of land  into zones other than RS-1, shall meet all requirements for map amendments  set forth in Section 1107.01.
Council shall give consideration to the  comprehensive plan for that area when considering a zoning classification  other than RS-1.
D.  Public Hearing.
Upon application, the Planning Commission shall, after giving seven  (7) days notice, conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
The Planning  Commission shall consider and make recommendations on all proposed amendments,  taking into account:  (1) the testimony at the hearing; (2) a site inspection of the property  in question; (3) the recommendations from interested official bodies; (4) compliance with  the Comprehensive Plan and (5) the standards provided below.
1107.01.
Standards for Map Amendments.
A.
No request, other than those made by the city council, planning commission, planning  director, or any department or agency of the city, for a change in zoning classification or  creation of a separate district shall be considered which involves an area of less than two  acres, except in the following cases:     1.
The extension of existing district boundaries;   2.
The addition of O-I or C-2 zoning contiguous to existing commercial or  industrial zones.
May 10, 2021   XI-10   3.
The zoning of an existing lot of record, surrounded by unzoned property,  which was outside the municipal limits and is requesting annexation.
B.
No rezoning of land to the Manufacturing (M) District shall be permitted except on a  specific and documented finding that:       1.
There is an inadequate supply of land zoned for these uses or the proposed use   cannot be accommodated by those sites due to lack of transportation, water, or  sewer, or that the market area to be served by the proposed use cannot be  efficiently served by the geographical location of the existing Industrial  District.
2.
Roads, floodplains, or other existing or planned features will insure sufficient   buffering to protect surrounding land and uses from the negative impacts of the  proposed industrial use.
C. There shall be no rezoning of land from Agricultural (AG) to any other district until   such time as adequate public utilities are available.
1107.02.
Annexation     The following requirements must be fulfilled for a petition to be considered  by the Planning Commission.
A.
Ownership.
The petitioner must be the owner of the property, and must  submit an accurate description of the property proposed for annexation.
This  requirement can be met by submitting a survey and a legal description  prepared and signed by a surveyor registered in the State of Alabama; or a  legally recorded subdivision plat showing the property in question.
B.  Contiguity.
The property to be annexed must be contiguous to the  existing corporate boundary of the City of Northport.
For this purpose the  term "contiguous" means either:     1.
A boundary of the property proposed for annexation adjoins the  existing corporate boundary of the City of Northport for a distance of at  least one (1) foot; or,    2.
At least one (1) foot of the boundary of the property proposed for  annexation is directly across the right-of-way of a publicly dedicated  street, or a railroad, or across from a creek or river, a utility right-of-way,  or similar natural boundary from the existing corporate boundary of the  City of Northport.
May 10, 2021   XI-11   3.
A strip of land at least sixty (60) feet wide connects the property  proposed for annexation to the corporate boundary of the City of  Northport; and the connecting strip is included in the annexation petition.
C.  Review of Petitions.
Each annexation petition will be submitted to all  City department heads for review and comment.
All such comments will be  presented to the Planning Commission and City Council for consideration in  making a decision.
D.  Property Located in a Fire District.
If the property requested to be  annexed lies within the territory of a fire district, other than the Northport  Fire District, the property owner must provide proof that they have been  released from said fire district prior to a petition for annexation being  processed.
Proof may be provided in the form of written documentation  from the Board of Directors of the Fire District certifying that such a release  has been granted and that all fees associated with said release have been paid  in full.
In the event the applicant fails to remove the property from any fire  district prior to annexation, applicant shall reimburse the City for all costs,  including all attorneys’ fees, for the removal by the City of this property  from any fire district after annexation.
E.  Guidelines for Review.
The following guidelines will be used by the  Planning Commission in reviewing petitions for annexation.
1.
Zoning Classification.
All properties annexed into the City of  Northport shall be classified as RS-1, single-family residential, or  such other district that is specifically requested by the  petitioner(s) in the annexation petition.
All requests for  annexation of land into zones other than RS-1, shall meet all  requirements for map amendments set forth in Section 1107.01.
Council shall give consideration to the comprehensive plan for  that area when considering a zoning classification other than RS- 1.
2.
Minimum Area.
If the property for which annexation is being   requested is less than three (3) acres in area, consideration should  only be given to annexation of the entire parcel.
If the property for which annexation is being requested is more  than three (3) acres in area, consideration will be given to  annexing a portion of said property.
However, neither the portion  recommended for annexation, nor the portion remaining  unincorporated, should be less than three (3) acres; nor should the  annexation of such portion make it unduly difficult for other  property owners in the vicinity to achieve the degree of contiguity  necessary to make their property eligible for annexation.
May 10, 2021   XI-12     3.
Public Access.
The property for which annexation is being   requested should have direct access to a public right-of-way.
For  this purpose the term "direct access" means fronting on a  dedicated public right-of-way; or having an unrestricted  connection to a public right-of-way, capable of providing safe and  ready access for public service vehicles, and approved by the  Planning Commission.
1107.03.
Report of the Planning Commission.
A.
The Planning Commission shall make a report to the City Council outlining the  proposed amendment.
No amendment shall be passed except by a majority vote of the  members of the City Council present.
B.
The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed  amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public  interest and not solely for the interest of the applicant.
C.  For each disapproved map amendment, the Planning Commission shall make findings  on each of the following matters based on the evidence presented to it:     1.
The proposed amendment’s ability to uphold the policies of the   Comprehensive Plan.
2.
The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the   proposed zoning.
3.
The adequacy of public facilities, such as sewer and water, and other required   public services.
Section 1108.
Variances.
1108.01.
Purpose.
The purpose of this Section is to empower the Board of Zoning Adjustment  to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this Ordinance.
It is expected  that the granting of variances will be rare.
However, a variance may be appropriate where, by  reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape; or by reason of other exceptional  topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece  of property, the strict application of any regulation enacted under this Ordinance would result in  peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner’s use of such property.
Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction  with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Board of Zoning  Adjustment prior to approval of any such site plan.
This shall include existing development  sites, proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement of     May 10, 2021   XI-13   this Ordinance.
The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on the  variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved.
1108.02.
Application.
Any property owner may apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a  variance using forms to be obtained from the Department of Planning & Inspections.
Applications must be submitted by noon on the date of the applicable deadline for the meeting at  which it is to be heard.
All required fees and any other information requested by the Planning  Director shall be submitted along with the completed application.
1108.03.
Standards for Variances.
The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in  the strict application of the provision of this Ordinance unless it finds that the following  requirements and standards are satisfied.
In general, the power to authorize a variance from the  terms of this Ordinance shall be sparingly exercised.
It is the intent of this Ordinance that the  variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which  poses practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property as  intended by the Zoning Ordinance.
Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment  necessary for the reasonable use of the land.
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that  practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted.
In particular, the  applicant shall establish and substantiate in writing that the appeal for the variance conforms to  all of the requirements and standards listed below:       A.
The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent  of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and  shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
B.
The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use, which is not  permitted in the district.
C.  There must be proof of unique circumstances:  there must exist special circumstances  or conditions fully described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which  the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or  buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the district, and which  circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this  Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.
D.  There must be proof of unnecessary hardship.
It is not sufficient proof of hardship to  show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted.
Furthermore, the  hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by  one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions; it must result from the  application of this Ordinance; it must be suffered directly by the property in question; and  evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered.
May 10, 2021   XI-14   E.  That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or  building and that the variance as granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment is the  minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
F.  That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to  adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the  danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property  values within the adjacent neighborhood.
G.  That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any  special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in  the same district.
The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the  objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
1108.04.
Public Hearing.
Upon application, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall schedule a  public hearing on the proposed variance to be held at least ten (10) days after a public notice has  been published in the local newspaper, and after the adjacent property owners most affected by  the variance request have been notified by certified mail.
The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall  consider and decide all proposed variances taking into account the standards enumerated above.
After the close of a public hearing and within ten (10) days the Board of Zoning Adjustment  shall render a written decision, setting forth the reasons for such decision, which shall be  accompanied by finding of fact(s) specifying the reason(s) for such decision.
All such decisions  are final and binding on all parties.
Section 1109.
Appeal of an Administrative Interpretation or Action.
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected  by any provision of this Ordinance or by any decision, or any order to stop, cease, and desist,  issued by the Planning Director, Chief Building Official, or their designated representative,  in  enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance.
1109.01.

D.   The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal and give  due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a written decision on the appeal without  unreasonable delay.
The Board may affirm, reserve, wholly or in part, or modify the  order, requirement, decision, or determination, as in its opinion it determines ought to be  done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is  taken.
The Planning & Inspections Department shall maintain complete records of all  appeal actions of the Board.
E.  Within ten (10) days after the close of a public hearing the Board shall render a  written decision giving the reason(s) for its decision.
F.  In rendering a decision with respect to an appeal from any order, decision, or  determination the Board shall strictly interpret the language of the Ordinance and shall  find that the city official was correct in his/her decision or in error.
Should be Board find  that the interpretation, decision or actions was in error they must provide what is in their  opinion the correct interpretation, decision or action.
However, the Board shall not  render any decision which shall modify an order, decision, or determination which  confers rights or privileges on the appellant that are not otherwise permissible under the  strict interpretation of this language of this Ordinance.
G.  Such decision shall be submitted to the appellant and the Planning Director.
1109.02.
All decisions rendered by the Board shall be final and binding on all parties.

New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was  not available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing.
B.
The decision resulted from an error, made by the Board, the Planning Director, or any  other City official, in procedures required by this Ordinance or State law.
C.  The decision resulted from an error in substantive law under the provisions of this  Ordinance or the Code of Alabama.

Any applicant wishing a rehearing shall appear before the Board to present one or  more of the qualifying conditions listed in this Section.
If the Board finds that one or more of these conditions exists, the applicant shall be permitted to  submit a new application, together with the required fees.
The new application shall be heard at     May 10, 2021   XI-16   a subsequent meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements.
Allowing a new application does not obligate the Board to grant the request.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board may within 15 days after such decision  appeal to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction.
Section 1110.

SECTION 1.1 INTENT      This ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate competing interests in the use,   enjoyment and development of land within the City of Opelika.
Every possible consideration has   been given to the public interest, individual property rights and the impacts, or externalities,   associated with the development of land in Opelika.
It is the goal of this ordinance that both the   burdens and the benefits it implies be rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and   property owners of Opelika.
Changes in zoning (rezoning) may appear to reduce the certainty of protection to owners of   neighboring property and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to the City of Opelika.
This   ordinance contains standards and procedures intended to insure that neighbors, the   citizenry-at-large, and the City of Opelika are protected from adverse impacts; and that the   community's general welfare is protected and enhanced.
Distinctions between zoning districts are   significant and are based on the policies contained in the Opelika Comprehensive Plan.
The   districts are sized and located to meet the needs in Opelika for preservation of stable, existing   development; for improvement of declining and transitional areas; and to encourage and promote   growth and long-term economic stability.
This ordinance contains clear, detailed procedures for   the justified change of zoning district designations, in accordance with the Opelika Comprehensive   Plan, as time passes.
SECTION 1.2 PURPOSE      The purpose of the ordinance is the implementation of the Opelika Comprehensive Plan, and the   promotion of the health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the present and future inhabitants   of the City of Opelika.
Specifically, it is the purpose of this ordinance to preserve and maintain a   healthful environment by providing standards and procedures to control the density of   development, to control the intensity of development in areas of sensitive natural resources, and   to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts.
Further, it is the purpose of this ordinance   to regulate the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residences   and other uses, and to establish standards so that all the people of the City of Opelika may have   access to decent, sound, sanitary and safe housing.
Finally, it is the express purpose of this   ordinance to lessen the danger of congestion of traffic on the streets, roads and highways of the   city; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and other dangers; to provide adequate privacy, light   and air, to protect the tax base by facilitating cost effective development within the city; to secure        Zoning Ordinance, Section I: Short Title, September 17, 1991   2   economy in local government expenditures; to protect landowners from adverse impacts of   adjoining developments; and to divide the incorporated areas of the City of Opelika into districts   according to the use of land and buildings, the density of development, the intensity of such use   and development (including height and bulk), and the provision of adequate open space.

SECTION 4.2 POWERS      The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers: To hear and decide appeals   where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made   by the Zoning Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this chapter, to authorize   upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary   to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, the enforcement or the provisions of this   chapter would result in unwarranted hardship and injustice, but which will most nearly accomplish   the purpose and intent of this chapter, to hear and decide on applications for interpretation of the   Zoning District Map where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a district boundary.
A. Variances.
The Board shall have the power to grant the following variances:      1.
A variation in the yard requirements in any district so as to relieve practical difficulties or   particular hardships in cases when and where, by reason of exceptional narrowness,   shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of   such regulation or restriction, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other   extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or the use or development   of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of such regulation or   restriction would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional   hardship upon the owner of such property.
Such grant of variance shall comply as nearly   as possible in every respect with the spirit, intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, it   being the purpose of this provision to authorize the granting of a variation only for reasons   of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations sought by   applicants for purposes or reasons of convenience, profit or caprice.
2.
No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds: That the strict application   of this ordinance would produce unwarranted hardship; or practical difficulty that such   hardship or difficulty is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district   and the same vicinity; that the authorization of such variances will not be of substantial   detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by   the granting of the variance, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or   building or structure that is prohibited in a given district.
3.
No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the condition or situation of the   property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a        Zoning Ordinance, Section IV: Zoning Board of Adjustment, Appointment, Duties, and Responsibilities, September   17, 1991   31   nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of general regulation to be   adopted as an amendment to this chapter.
4.
Whenever an application for a variance cancels or withdraws his application after an   advertisement for a public hearing has been published, any rescheduling for a public   hearing on said application or reapplication for the same variance shall be more than four   (4) months after the original public hearing was scheduled.
5.
The procedure for amendment of a special exception or variance already approved, or a   request for a change of conditions attached to an approval, shall be the same as for a new   application, except that where the Zoning Administrator determines the change to be minor   relative to the original approval, he may transmit the same to the Board with the original   record without requiring that a new application be filed.
B.
Interpretation of District Boundaries.
Application for interpretation of district boundaries may be made by any property owner, agent,   tenant, government official, department, board or bureau to the City Planner on the forms provided   therefore and in accordance with rules adopted by the Board.
The application and accompanying,   maps, plans or other information shall be transmitted promptly to the City Planner who shall place   the matter on the docket, and the City Planner shall transmit a copy of the application to the   Planning Commission, which may send a recommendation to the Board or appear as a party at the   hearing.
SECTION 4.3 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT      In exercising the above-mentioned powers the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of   this Ordinance, reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify the order, requirement decision   or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination   as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal   is taken.
The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any   order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official or to decide in   favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance or   to affect any variation in such ordinance.
SECTION 4.4 APPEALS      Appeal to the Board of Adjustment and to the Courts.
It is the intent of the governing authority   of the City that all questions of interpretation and enforcement of this ordinance shall be   presented first to the Zoning Administrator.
Other than those applications and matters upon   which the terms and provisions of this ordinance may require action and decision by the said   Board of Adjustment, only the appeals taken in the manner and form as provided in this   ordinance from the actions and decisions of the Zoning Administrator will be considered and   acted upon by the said Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Furthermore, in relation to applying runway protection   zone and noise impact zone requirements, use regulations shall apply to the structure or facilities   constituting the use and shall generally apply to accessory open space, landscape and buffering,   stormwater management, or driveway and parking uses.
7.4.06 Airport Height Notification Zone and Regulation.
A.
Establishment of zone.
The airport height notification zone is hereby established as an overlay zone on the adopted City   zoning map.
This zone is established to regulate the height of structures and natural vegetation for   areas in proximity to the public use airports located within the City of Opelika.
The airport height   notification zone, consists of two (2) subzones, is defined as:   Subzone A.
The area surrounding each public use airport extending outward twenty   thousand (20,000) feet from the ends and each side of all active runways.
Subzone B.
The area outside of Subzone A.
B.
Airport height definition.
For the purposes of determining building height in the height notification zone, height shall be   measured in feet above ground level, rounded to the highest foot.
The total structure height shall   include anything mounted on top of the structure, such as antennas, obstruction lights, lightning   rods, etc.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   53   C. Height notification regulations.
All applicants of development proposals for land within the height notification zone determined to   be a potential airport obstruction shall forward a notice of proposed construction (form 7460) to   the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be reviewed for conformance with the obstructions   standards detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77 Subpart C. (14 CFR Part 77),   as may be amended from time to time.
1.
A proposed development shall be determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" if   the proposed development would result in a structure or natural vegetation having a   height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the ends   and sides of a public use airport active runway at a slope of one (1) foot vertical to one   hundred (100) feet horizontal outward to twenty thousand (20,000) feet for Subzone A   or two hundred (200) feet above ground level for Subzone B.
Applicants of any   development proposal determined by the City to result in a structure(s) that constitutes   a "potential airport obstruction" shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction   during the development proposal review process by the Planning Director or his   designee.
a.
No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for   construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure which is   determined by the City to be a "potential airport obstruction" unless a city airport   construction permit is granted.
2.
Any proposed development which is not determined to be a "potential airport obstruction"   is exempt from any airport height notification zone permitting regulations contained herein.
3.
Airport construction permit procedures and criteria for approval.
Any applicant affected by   a notice of potential obstruction may apply to the Planning Director for an airport   construction permit.
a.
Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit.
i.
Applicants shall submit to the Planning Department a completed airport   construction permit application form (as provided by the City) and a copy of the   notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA for the project.

ii.
Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, applicants shall submit to   the Planning Department the final determination issued by the FAA based on its   review of the applicant's notice of proposed construction submitted in accordance   with 14 CFR Part 77.   b.
Criteria for granting an airport construction permit.
i.
Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its   construction would not exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the   Planning Director shall grant an airport construction permit for the proposed   development provided that a condition is attached to the permit approval to ensure   that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted prior to the issuance of a   certificate of occupancy (C.O.)
if so required by Chapter 14-60, in accordance   with the standards of Rules of the Department of Transportation and Federal   Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, as amended.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   54   ii.
Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined that the   proposed development exceeds the obstruction standards of 14 CFR Part 77, no   airport construction permit may be approved, and a City airport obstruction   variance must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed development to   proceed.
4.
A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport   hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air   navigation than it was on the effective date of these regulations or any amendments   thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
7.4.07 Airport Runway Protection Zone and Regulations.
A.
Zone establishment.
There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map a   runway protection zone for areas at each end of every active runway as may be amended from time   to time.

7.4.08 Airport Noise Impact Zone and Regulations.
A.
Zone establishment.
There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map an   airport noise impact zone for areas surrounding airport.
The airport noise impact zone is an area in   which special construction standards are recommended for new construction and alteration,   moving and repair to minimize the impact of airport generated noise routinely produced by   continuation of normal airport operations.
The airport noise impact zone is defined as follows:   1.
An area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (½) the length of the longest planned   runway on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline.
For land use control   purposes, this boundary shall be considered to be consistent with the sixty-five (65) to        Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   55   seventy (70) level day night (ldn) zone determined by an official Part 150 Noise Study or   other recognized study, such as an Environmental Assessment, if a study is completed.
B.
Noise impact zone regulations.
Provisions of this section shall apply to construction, alteration, moving, repair and use of any   building or structure within the airport noise impact zone.
1.
Applicants for building permits or permits granted by the Planning Department in the   noise impact zone shall be provided information at the time of application regarding   recommended amounts of noise level reduction (NLR) in the airport noise impact zone as   established by this Ordinance as well as guidelines for how such noise reduction shall be   achieved.
7.4.09 Nonconforming Uses.
A.
Regulations not Retroactive.
These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes   or alterations of any structure not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date of this   chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.
Nonconforming   vegetation is subject to removal per the provisions of § 7.4.
B.

Applications submitted to the Planning Department shall   be promptly considered and approved or denied.
Applications for variances by the Board of   Zoning Adjustment shall be transmitted by the Planning Director.
7.4.12 Special Requirements.
A.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no use within the City of Opelika   shall interfere with any operation of an airborne aircraft using a public use airport.
The   following special requirements shall apply to proposed developments or land use practices that   attract or sustain hazardous wildlife populations on or near airports that can significantly   increase the potential for wildlife-aircraft collisions.
1.
The distance between the Airport’s aircraft movement areas, loading ramps or aircraft   parking areas and the wildlife attractant should be a distance of 10,000 feet.
A distance   of 5 statute miles is recommended, if the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife   movement into or across the approach or departure airspace.
For additional information   please consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation   Administration for standard practices for locating certain land uses having the potential   to attract hazardous wildlife to or in the vicinity of public use airports.
2.
Sludge disposal, effluent spraying, compost activities and any other waste disposa1   activities should normally not be allowed within the property limits of the Airport.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   57   3.
Disposal sites for putrescible material, i.e.
garbage dumps, landfills, and other similarly   licensed or titled facilities, are to be considered incompatible when located within 10,000   feet of the Airport’s runways.
4.
Disposal sites for nonputrescible material, e.g.
construction demolition waste,   automobile junk yards, kitchen appliances, and incinerator ash residue, are normally   considered incompatible to within 10,000 feet of a runway used by turbine powered   aircraft.
However, depending upon the specific proposal, the results of a site   investigation, and the proposed location relative to the runway approach/departure paths,   certain types of restricted nonputrescible disposal operations may be found non-  objectionable off airport, provided assurances are obtained from the proponent, and   included in the licensing process, that should the site cause an increase in bird activity   which might be hazardous to safe aircraft operations, action will be taken to mitigate the   hazard or close the site.
5.
Proposed developments which produce lights or illumination, smoke, glare or other   visual hazards, or produce electronic interference with airport/airplane navigation   signals are subject to the standards specified in the FAA Procedures Manual 7400-2C as   may be applied and enforced by the state and/or federal governments.
6.
Vegetation in the airport north-south approach zone or the airport northwest-southeast   approach zone must be removed if said vegetation penetrates the approach surfaces.
7.4.13 Standards for Variances Applicable to the Airport.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree   or use property not in accordance with the regulations of this Section may apply to the Opelika   Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance from such regulations.
Applications for variances shall   follow the same procedure for other variances (See Section 4.1 Procedures).
The application for   a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration   (FAA) and the Airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation   facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.
A.
Criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance.
Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would   exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the board of adjustment may grant an airport   obstruction variance for a proposed development.
Such a variance may be granted if the board   determines that:   1.
The literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical   difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to   the public interest (i.e.
the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace   without adverse impact to surrounding environs).
2.
Granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation.
3.
Granting the variance will do substantial justice.
4.
The variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations.
ALL VARIANCES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS AND TERMS AS   RECOMMENDED BY THE FAA.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   58   B.
The following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be   approved:   1.
A condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved   structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an   obstruction in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number 70/7460-  1K, as it may be amended.
Where such marking or lighting is required, such requirement   shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.)
for the affected   structure.
2.
The FAA must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid.
3.
Consideration shall be given to:   a.
The nature of the terrain and height (height per § 512.02) of existing structures.
b.
Public and private interests and investments.
c. The character of flying operations and planned development of airports.
d. FAA designated federal airways.
e. Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the   minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport.
f. Technological advances.
g. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air.
h. Land use density.
i.
The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace.
j.
The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or proposed   structures identified in the City of Opelika.
k. FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the   FAA.
l. Comments and recommendations from the Airport.
m. Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts.
7.4.14 Obstruction Marking and Lighting.
Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose   of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the   owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense, to install, operate and   maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of   an airport hazard.1            1 Date of Amendment: December 15, 2009 Ordinance No.

108-11        Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   60   SECTION 7.6 GATEWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT3      This section authorizes the establishment of Gateway Corridor Overlay Districts.
The intent of this   section is to specify those areas that serve as a primary means of entry into Opelika and name those   areas the Gateway Corridor Overlay District.
The district is designated to be an overlay appended   to residential, commercial, industrial or any other districts.
The Gateway Overlay District is   similar to airport hazard areas (Section 7.4) and the Flood Plain Overlay District (see Section 7.5)   in that additional regulation will apply and supersede the underlying district regulations.
In other   words, a Gateway Overlay District can be placed on top of any of the City’s existing zoning   districts creating an overlap in the zoning along a specified length of roadway desired to be   regulated.
Any proposed development, then, would have to meet the zoning requirements of both   the existing zone and the Gateway Overlay district.
The Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall   include roadway corridors and their adjacent development located in several use districts.
Uses   typically include retail, wholesale, motel, recreation, office, fast-food establishments, and similar   uses.
This district is characterized by special design controls enforced to prevent incompatible   uses and to maintain an attractive “gateway” or entrance into Opelika.
The design of these   corridors and their major elements shall reflect the identity and image of the entire City of Opelika.
The Gateway Corridors are divided into two subdivisions based on the development pattern that   the streets were originally constructed under.
Gateway Corridor - Primary Overlay District   Those corridors which were developed under more modern and suburban development patterns   and to specifically accommodate automobiles are designated Gateway Corridor – Primary (GC-  P).
These corridors typically have larger lots with ample parking and buildings setback further   from the public right-of-way.
Gateway Corridor - Secondary Overlay District   The corridors found in older sections of the City of Opelika and retro-fitted to accommodate   automobiles area designated Gateway Corridor-Secondary (GC-S).
These corridors feature   smaller, more standardized lots.
The structures on these lots are often smaller and located at   varying positions on the lot based on the timeframe in which they were built.
Newer buildings   are often setback further while, older buildings are usually closer to the right-of-way.
The Gateway Corridor districts are designated as shown on the official City of Opelika Zoning   Map      The GC-P shall extend 150 feet from the outside edge of both sides of the right-of-way from the   following street segments:         1.

The Gateway Corridor Overlay District is supplemental to the underlying zoning district   classifications.
The Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall be imposed in addition to said   underlying zoning regulations.
In any case where the standards and requirements of the Gateway   Corridor Overlay District conflict with those of the underlying zoning district, the standards and   requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall govern, unless specifically noted   otherwise by the Zoning Ordinance.
The Gateway Corridor Overlay District regulations shall not apply to platted subdivision lots for   new single family detached dwellings and existing single family detached dwellings.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   62   The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant exceptions from the requirements of the regulations   when due to the location, size and shape of the property, development of the parcel under its current   zoning and in conformity with the requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District would   present a substantial and unique hardship.
References in the Zoning Ordinance to Gateway Corridor 1 District (GC-1) and Gateway Corridor   2 District (GC-2) are deleted, repealed and eliminated and replaced by the Gateway Corridor   Overlay District (GC), designated Gateway Corridor – Primary (GC-P) or Gateway Corridor –   Secondary (GC-S).
Whenever in the Zoning Ordinance reference is made to Gateway Corridor 1   District (GC-1) and/or Gateway Corridor 2 District (GC-2), or any like form, the same shall be   construed to refer to the Gateway Corridor District (GC).
A.

Purpose.
The R/E District is intended to accommodate mixed and divergent uses within a narrowly defined   area, which is largely self-contained and segregated from the surrounding developments.
Because   of the variant uses, it is intended that the R/E District be treated unlike and unique from any other   district or zoning classifications.
It is anticipated that the R/E District will be a tourist attraction   with a regional impact and will generate traffic, noise and light, which will be greater than other   areas.
Therefore, the restrictions on the application of the R/E District as defined herein must be   strictly applied.
However, once established the R/E District will be characterized by an   unconventional mix of uses that will, among other things, allow for multiple uses of parking   facilities during any twenty-four (24) hour period without requiring each use to have an   independent parking ratio as is required in other zoning districts.
See Section 7.9 F. for parking   regulation.

It is intended that matters   dealing with platting and subdivision of any portion of the R/E District, development plans,   signage, building height, parking, or traffic shall not need nor be required to have Planning   Commission approvals; rather the Planning Staff and City Engineer are authorized to review   and approve all such matters including but not limited to administrative subdivisions, access   to public rights of way, and parking requirements.

D. Maintenance of Open Space.
Whenever common open space is provided, the Planning Commission or the City Council, as   appropriate, shall require that an association of owners or tenants be created for the purpose of   maintaining such open space.
It shall be created in such a manner that owners of property shall   automatically be members and shall be subject to assessments levied to maintain said open space   for the purposes intended.
The period of existence of such association shall not be less than twenty   (20) years, and it shall continue thereafter and until a majority vote of members shall terminate it.
E. Parking.
Within the R/E District, there will be numerous businesses and activities that will allow for shared   use of parking facilities and areas that will serve as parking for some events but as other uses when   not assigned as parking.
Therefore, when reviewing parking needs for the R/E District, no specific   parking ratio will be required.
The Planning Staff and City Engineer must consider the uses, timing   of such uses and functionality of the areas for the R/E District as a whole and not require each site   to maintain a self-supporting parking requirement.
The R/E District may have designated   event/overflow parking that may be maintained as grassed or partially grassed areas.
As used   herein an event facility shall be one that is not open on a normal basis.
Such designation as   event/overflow parking shall not prohibit the designation of the same area for other uses or   activities at times when not being used as parking.
For example, an area used for a drive-in theatre        Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   84   may also be considered as parking for events such as a concert or other entertainment or retail   venues.
F. Green Space (Landscaping Areas).
Any “green space” requirements for any property being developed within the R/E District shall   be considered for the R/E District as a whole.
The Owner shall submit an overall landscape and   screening plan to the City Planner.
Green space may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs,   ground cover, and other materials such as rocks, water, sculpture, art, walls, paving materials and   street furniture.
Each site shall not be required to maintain a self-supporting “green” requirement.
In considering the “green space” for the R/E District, the Planning Staff shall consider each and   every area within the R/E District that maintains any grass or other vegetation toward any   “green” requirement even if such area is used for some other use such as, for example, parking,   and drive-in theatre or amphitheater.11    11 Date of Amendment: November 21, 2007 Ordinance No.

Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007   113   SECTION 8.17 CONDITIONAL USE14      A.
Purpose.
Conditional uses are those uses that may have some special impact when proposed for location in   particular zoning district or uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding environment cannot   be determined in advance of the use being proposed d in a particular location.
At that time, a review   of the location, design, configuration, and impact is conducted to determine whether the proposed   use should be permitted by weighing public need or benefit against the local impact.
The review   considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; planned   and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by which it is   suggested is necessary or desirable to provide a development that is in the interest of the public   convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the area or the City of Opelika; and   whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any   adverse effect of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the proposed use on the   immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and welfare in general.
B. Applicability.
Any use that is permitted as a conditional use by this ordinance shall comply with this Section.
Any   permitted use proposed for development at a land use intensity that exceeds the maximum permitted   by the district, provided it does not exceed the maximum allowed by this ordinance, shall comply   with this Section.
Any renovations reuse, or preservation proposal that includes a change of use that   is not allowed by the zoning district in which the structure is located, shall comply with this Section.
Any use that involves filling of a floodplain shall comply with this Section.
C. Procedure.
1.
Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted simultaneously with an   application for a building permit unless prior approval has been obtained.
Applications   must be submitted (21) twenty-one days prior to the Planning Commission meeting at   which they are to be heard.
Applications for conditional uses in all districts must contain   the following information:      a.
Applications involving new construction, additions, or site reconfiguration must   comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.16 except for subsection E.   Technical Information which is only required at the conditional use approval stage if   requested by the City Staff or the Opelika Planning Commission.
This does not   obviate any need for these items during a later site plan or technical review.
b.

SECTION 8.18.1 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (PRD)16      A.
Purpose.
The intent of this section is to provide alternatives to the conventional residential development   regulations that are permitted in Opelika’s Land Development Regulations protecting existing land   uses and property values.
This section permits greater flexibility in residential design in order to   encourage innovative residential plans, promote superior residential developments, and offer   neighborhood amenities such as usable open space, designated recreational areas, sidewalks,   decorative street lighting, and streetscapes.
The Planning Commission will determine if the   application, subdivision plan, and site design conform to the requirements of these regulations and   that the development will accomplish the following purposes:   1.
To ensure compatibility is achieved with adjacent land uses that differ in function, scale, and   intensity17 or with future adjacent land uses based on adjacent zoning districts.
Compatibility   is achieved when adjacent land uses do not create adverse effects upon one another.
The   subdivision layout and design should reflect the inherent character of the existing land uses   yet demonstrate distinctive features that will give the development a sense of identity.
In   areas where different uses abut, a variety of measures may be employed to ensure   compatibility including: the use of adequate setbacks, landscaping, perimeter buffers, and   building height considerations.
2.
To conserve and preserve land to assure that its development will best maintain or enhance   the appearance, character, natural beauty and historic interest of an area;   3.
To preserve land for common area for neighborhood amenities;   4.
To encourage development in such a way as to promote the most appropriate use of land,   considering its particular size and topography, to protect natural drainage systems, streams,   wetlands, floodplains, and to properly manage for stormwater runoff and erosion and   sedimentation control.

Purpose and Intent.
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to regulate adult-oriented businesses, which, unless closely   regulated, tend to have serious secondary effects on the community.
The City of Opelika has   recognized that adult businesses, due to their nature and deleterious secondary effects, can have   serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to urban blight and   downgrading the quality of life.
The secondary effects on the community include, but are not limited   to, the following: negative impacts on children, increased crime against women and children, public   health concerns including sexually transmitted diseases, depreciation of property values and increase   in vacancies in residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of adult businesses, interference with   residential property owners' enjoyment of their property when such property is located in the vicinity   of adult businesses as a result of increases in crime, litter, noise and vandalism, and higher crime   rates in the vicinity of adult businesses.
Special regulations of adult businesses are necessary to   minimize these adverse effects and the potential degradation of sensitive areas (schools, place of   worship, etc.)
and neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult businesses.
The City of Opelika recognizes the free speech rights of businesses and individual consumers.
It is   neither the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to impose limitations or restrictions on the content   of any communicative material.
It is neither the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to restrict or   deny access by adults to communication materials or to deny access by the distributors of adult   businesses to their intended market.
However, after considering citizen testimonies and   recommendations from professional staff concerning the secondary effects of adult businesses on   the community, the City determined this ordinance is necessary to establish reasonable regulations   to reduce the secondary effects that adult businesses have upon the residents of the City.
Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or   maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the   State of Alabama regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct,   lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof.
Section 19 Indecency and Obscenity of the Code of Ordinances, City of Opelika concerning   indecency, obscenity, and related offences prohibits the following:   • It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to show any obscene29 materials or exhibits to   minors or have obscene a performance with knowledge a minor is present (minor - any   unmarried person under the age of eighteen years).

SECTION 8.28 STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC LAND USES      SECTION 8.28.1 SMALL BOX DISCOUNT STORE36     A.
Purpose and Intent   The purpose and intent of this section is to regulate the continued growth and development of   small box discount stores, promotes greater diversity of retail options and convenient access to   fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy foods.
The number of small box discount stores have   increased over the last decade.
Many of these stores are in close proximity to each other.
While it   is recognized that small box discount stores may be the only convenient source of some food items   for people in areas underserved by traditional grocery stores, it is also recognized that small box   discount stores offer limited healthy fresh food options, especially when it comes to fresh fruits   and vegetables and fresh or frozen meats.
A good mix of food retail has the potential to revitalize   neighborhoods and commercial centers and improve access to a healthy diet, particularly for   populations in underserved areas.
Most of these stores are located in areas classified by the United States Department of Agriculture   as food deserts.
The City of Opelika desires to continue to allow the presence of small box   discount stores, but it is also necessary to regulate them and to encourage stores to offer more   healthy fresh food options.
These regulations will promote the efficient use of land and resources   in the City of Opelika, AL, and are necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the   citizens of Opelika.
The City of Opelika will accomplish this by assessing the food retail   environment based upon an evaluation of the subject retail landscape at the time of a zoning   application   B.

Whether the proposed small box discount store will likely have a detrimental impact on   the development of grocery stores and other businesses that sell fresh and healthy food   items in the area to be served by the proposed use.
b.
The availability of healthy food options in the area of the proposed use including the   proximity of full-service grocery stores within one-half mile of the proposed use and   effect of the use on the retail food environment index as defined by the Centers for   Disease Control and Prevention.

Proper landscaping benefits the City by reducing soil erosion and storm   water runoff, glare from vehicles, wind, heat, noise, dust, and other offensive conditions.
Furthermore, landscaping buffers and screens incompatible land uses, maintains and enhances the   character of neighborhoods, serves to attract potential residents and developers to the City, and   generally creates a safer, more attractive and more pleasant living and working environment for   all residents of the City of Opelika.

When more than 25 spaces are proposed, these   plantings shall be placed within "parking lot islands" and/or   "parallel planting peninsulas."
Parking Lot Island:   A planting island contained completely within the confines   of a parking facility.
These islands shall be elevated at least   four (4) inches in height and bordered by concrete curbing.
These are ideal places for required parking lot plantings (see   Appendix).
Parallel Planting Peninsula:   A planting island that extends out into the parking area, and   is bounded on at least one (1) side by the outer edge of the   asphalt or building.
These shall be elevated at least four (4)   inches in height and bordered by concrete curbing.
These are   ideal places for required parking lot plantings (see   Appendix).
Recommended Tree:   Any one (1) of the trees listed under "Section 10.9   Recommended Trees."

Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991   194      Article II.
SECTION 10.6 LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS      A.
Steps for Approval.
Step 1 Determine the number of base points required via shade trees, shrubbery or a   combination thereof; [see Section 10.6(B)]      Step 2 Determine the number of Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs which must be planted.
The   quantity of plants required is based on the number of parking spaces proposed; [see   Section 10.6(C)]      Step 3 Determine whether Residential and/or Parking Lot Buffers apply to the   development; [see Section 10.6(D)]      Step 4 Develop a Landscape Plan with plantings in sufficient numbers to meet the    point requirements and with any applicable buffer.
[See Section 10.5(A)]      B.
Shade Planting Requirements/Point System.
Each developed area must equal or exceed a minimum number of "base points" in order to obtain   approval.
The number of points required depends on the size of the developed area (see Table 1).
Different types of plantings are worth different points; Large Trees are worth eleven (11) points,   Medium Trees are worth eight (8) points, Understory Trees are worth five (5) points, and   Shrubs/groundcovers are worth one (1) point (see Table 2).
The developer may use any combination of plantings to obtain the necessary number of points.
Different lots and landscapes will lend themselves to different types of plantings.
This Ordinance   attempts to encourage creativity and diversity in landscaping.
In no cases, however, shall a   mono-culture of plantings be allowed.
A variation of plantings, at least three (3) different species,   is required.
In order to obtain points, the plantings must be placed on the developing property and not on a   public right-of-way.
Number of Points Required for the Site   Table 1      Square Footage of the Developed Area* Number of Points Required            0-10,000 40 (+l per parking space)   10,001-20,000  60 (+1 per parking space)   20,001-30,000  80 (+1 per parking space)   30,001-40,000 100 (+1 per parking space)   40,001-50,000 120 (+1 per parking space)   50,001-60,000 140 (+1 per parking space)           Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991   195      * When only small portions of large lots are developed, (e.g.
only one (1) acre of a ten acre lot)   only the immediate construction area shall be considered when determining the number of points   required.
Contact the Planning Department to determine the immediate construction area.
Alternative formula for determining number of points required for sites greater than 60,000 square   feet:      Base points= [(X - 10,000)/500] + 40  {X=Construction Area}     Parking lot points= 1 per parking space      Point Values for Various Plantings   Table 2   Type of Plant Material Minimum Size Point Value   Large Tree* 2.0" - 2.5" Caliper 11   Medium Tree*.
1.25" - 1.5" Caliper 8   Understory Tree*      (Single Trunk) 1.25" - 1.5" Caliper   (Multiple Trunk) 6' - 8' Height   5      Shrub or Groundcover      Shrub - 24" 1   Groundcover 1 gallon minimum   1   • See Section 10.9 Recommended Tree List      C. Parking Lot Requirements.
All non-covered, street-level parking facilities established and governed by this Section shall be   landscaped in accordance with the following requirements:   1.
In addition to the number of "base points" required with shade plantings, one (1)   additional, point is added to the site for each parking space proposed.
These points must   be used to plant "Parking Lot Trees and/or Parking Lot Shrubs."
(E.g.
a 26,000 square   foot lot requires 80 base points; however, it also has 15 parking spaces.
The additional   15 points brings the lot up to 95 points, with 15 of those points designated as Parking   Lot Trees and/or shrubs.)
2.
On parking lots with less than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, "Parking Lot   Trees/Shrubs" may be spaced around the lot as desired to provide a uniform and   attractive design.
3.
On lots with more than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, "Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs"   shall be planted on "parking lot island(s)" and/or "parallel planting peninsulas" within   the confines of the established parking lot.
These plantings will minimize and break the   expanse of asphalt and concrete.
Acceptable islands and parallel planting peninsulas   are displayed in Figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix.
4.
Each "parking lot island" or "parallel planting peninsula" shall have at least one (1)   tree.
Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991   196      D. Buffers and Buffer Zones.
In addition to the required number of points above, a parcel may be required to buffer certain   portions of the property.
Trees from the "Recommended Tree List" planted to meet either Residential or Parking Lot buffer   requirements, may be applied toward the point requirements.
Shrubs may not be applied toward   the point requirements.
This provision allows credit for plantings in the buffer area(s); however, it   prevents a property from planting only in those areas.
In cases where a parking area abuts a residential zone, then the more stringent "Residential Zone   Buffer" requirements supersede the parking lot buffer.
1.
Residential Zone Buffer (see diagrams).
On any commercial, industrial, institutional, PUD or multi-family development, except   duplexes, adjacent to or abutting a residential zoning district, a buffer strip along the   property line(s) of the developing property is required.
The buffer shall run the entire length of the abutting lot line(s).
The type of buffer may   consist of any or all of the following: (see Residential Buffer Options in the Appendix)   a.
An opaque fence not less than six (6) feet in height, with horizontal or vertical   openings not greater than three (3) inches per one (1) linear foot AND a four (4) foot   wide strip of Evergreen plantings, which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height   within three full growing seasons planted on the inside of the fence or;   b.
A staggered double row of Evergreen plantings at least six (6) feet in   width, which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height and spaced in a manner which   after three (3) years will provide an impervious visual barrier or;   c. Natural, undisturbed forest at least twenty (20) feet in width that provides a   nearly impervious visual barrier due to the dense nature of the plants and/or trees.
If   this option is chosen, the City Horticulturist shall determine whether the barrier is   satisfactory through a site inspection prior to plan approval.
Barriers shall be erected   during construction to ensure the area is protected from damage due to construction.
2.
Parking Lot Buffer:  Asphalt closer than ten (10) feet to any property line shall be buffered   with one of the following types of buffers:   a.
A planting strip of no less than four (4) feet in width shall be provided between said   property line and the off-street parking facilities (asphalt).
A planting screen or hedge,   of developers choice, and between two (2) and four (4) feet in height shall be provided   and maintained on a continuing basis, except that such screen or hedge shall not   obstruct or obscure sight lines, restrict vehicular movement, or block pedestrian   walkways or sidewalks and/or,   b.
A six (6) foot wide single row of understory, medium, or large trees located between   said property line and the off-street parking facilities (asphalt).
The trees shall be   spaced in a ratio of one (1) understory tree every fifteen (15) feet, or one (1) medium   tree every thirty (30) feet, or one (1) large tree every forty-five (45) feet.
Shrubbery   shall be provided between the plantings.
Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991   197      The shrubs/trees shall be maintained on a continuing basis, except that such plantings   shall not obstruct or obscure sight lines, restrict vehicular movement, or block   pedestrian walkways or sidewalks.
The trees may be applied toward the base point   requirement; however, the shrubs may not be applied.
SECTION 10.7 EXISTING TREE CREDITS      In order to encourage the preservation of Opelika's older trees, certain requirements relating to the   number and density of new trees may be waived in the event existing trees are preserved.
A.
For each existing "Significant Tree" with a D.B.H.
between six (6) inches and ten (10)   inches, fifteen (15) fewer points are required.
For each existing "Significant Tree" between   I l" and twenty-four (24) inches, twenty (20) fewer points are required.
For each existing   "Significant Tree" with a D.B.H.
over twenty-four (24) inches, twenty-five (25) fewer   points are required.
However, precautions must be taken during construction to prevent   damage to the existing tree(s), and any tree that dies during or because of construction must   be replaced with a similar species or species approved by the City Horticulturist to equal   lost tree points.
(e.g.
An Oak with a D.B.H.
of twenty-five (25) inches is claimed as an   existing tree, but subsequently dies.
The developer must replace the tree with tree plantings   which exceed 25 points).
B.
Trees for which an owner/developer wishes to receive credit must be in the developed area   and cannot be in undeveloped portions of the parcel.
This stipulation prevents a developer   with a large tract of land from claiming credit on portions left undeveloped and thus   eliminating landscaping on the developed portion of the parcel.
SECTION 10.8 MAINTENANCE      The owner is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of planted trees in perpetuity within   his/her development.
After all plantings are finalized, the developer will schedule an inspection of   the plantings with the City Horticulturist and landscape installer.
If all plantings appear to be in   good condition, the City Horticulturist will issue a Certificate of Completion to the developer and   building official.
If plantings are subsequently damaged, in poor condition, diseased or dead, the City Horticulturist   may require the property owner to replace the plantings and bring the lot back into compliance.
Failure to bring the lot into compliance could lead to the City withholding a City of Opelika   Business License.
Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991   198      SECTION 10.9 RECOMMENDED TREES      The following is a list of recommended trees.
Generally, these trees are suitable for Opelika's   environment.
Developers may deviate from this list with written approval from the City   Horticulturist.

Conditional Uses.
Conditional uses are those that have some special effect, which differs from the potential impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have uniqueness such that their effect upon the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of a use being proposed in a particular location.
As such, Conditional Uses must be reviewed in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the proposed use; whether, and to what extent the use at the proposed location is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the intents of this Ordinance, and any other development policies and/or regulations of the City; and whether, and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, welfare, and safety in general.
Requests for Conditional Uses as designated within the district regulations are permitted only after approval by the Commission.
A.
Application.
All Conditional Uses shall require the submission of an application to the Commission.
Such application shall be filed with the Zoning Official by the property owner or authorized agent at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the date on which the application is scheduled to be heard by the Commission, and shall include a Conceptual Site Plan in accordance with this Section.
The submission of a conceptual use site plan is intended for administrative efficiency and does not relieve the applicant from providing a formal site plan satisfactory to the City Engineer upon approval of the conceptual use unless the Commission specifically relieves the applicant from such requirement.
1) Submission requirements.
The applicant must submit to the Community Development Department a Conceptual Site Plan of property on which the Conditional Use is requested, drawn to scale, to include but not limited to, the following:   a) Any and all buildings exactly as they exist and their proposed use.
b) Property lines  c) North arrow and scale  d) Proposed construction (if any) and identify.
e) Proposed and/or existing signs.
f) Parking, landscaping, ingress/egress, any other site information requested by the City.
g) Show all adjoining properties, buildings, and property owners’ names.
h) Drawing shall not be on cardboard.

The application shall not be processed nor reviewed without receipt of the required fee.
B.
Action by the Planning Commission.
The Commission shall schedule a hearing on the application at the first regularly scheduled meeting after compliance with notice provisions as set forth herein.
The Commission shall have sixty (60) days in which to approve or deny the proposed Conditional Use.
1) Review Standards.
The Commission shall review the request for compliance with this Ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances, for compatibility with the Comprehensive Master Plan, and for compatibility with the purposes of the applicable district.
In particular the Commission shall determine that satisfactory provisions have been made concerning the following:  a) Access to and from the property and the proposed structure and/or uses, with particular attention to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and emergency access.
Conditional uses shall only be permitted on premises fronting on a public thoroughfare conforming to all applicable standards of the City.
b) The location and accessibility of off-street parking and loading areas  c) The location and accessibility of refuse and service areas and their potentially adverse effects upon surrounding properties  d) The screening and buffering of potentially adverse views and activities from surrounding properties  e) Control of noise, glare, odor, surface water runoff, and other potentially disturbing impacts upon surrounding properties  f) The availability, location, and capacity of utilities  g)      The location and scale of signs and lighting with particular reference to traffic safety, glare, and visual compatibility with surrounding properties  h) The bulk, density, and lot coverage of structures, and yards and open areas, with reference to their compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
Conditional Uses shall be in conformity with the area and dimensional regulations of the applicable district and may only exceed a height limit in accordance with §5.4.
2) Effect of Conditions.
The Commission may impose such conditions for approval as it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and further the purposes of this Ordinance, in relation both to the items listed above and to any other factor it deems relevant.
Such approval and conditions shall be granted to the property, structure, and/or use for which Conditional Use is approved and not to a particular person.
Violations of conditions attached to any Conditional Use constitute violations of this Ordinance.
3) Decision.
Upon approval by the Commission, the Conditional Use shall be deemed to be approved, in which case, the applicant may then proceed with any other required approvals or permits required by the City.
If disapproved by the Commission, the applicant may appeal such decision to the Council.
Such appeal shall only be accepted within fifteen (15) working days of the decision of the Commission.
C. Limit on Re-application.
No new application shall be initiated for the same request on the same parcel of land more than once a year, unless specifically authorized by the Commission on the grounds that the circumstances and conditions relevant to the request have changed significantly since the prior hearing, including but not limited to, changes to the Comprehensive Master Plan, Zoning Ordinance, district regulations or boundaries, and/or abutting land uses, availability of adequate public services, utilities, and thoroughfares.
2.5.4.
Special Exception Uses.
All uses permitted by special exception as listed in the district regulations shall require the submission of an application to the Board.
A.
Application and Procedure.
1) A written application for a Special Exception Use shall be submitted at least twenty-one (21) days ahead of the regularly scheduled meeting indicating the section of this Ordinance under which the Special Exception Use is requested.
2) A Public Hearing shall be held before the Board, in which any party may appear in person, or by agent, or attorney.
B.
Review Standards.
A Special Exception Use shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:  1) The Board shall find that it is empowered under this Ordinance to grant a Special Exception Use, and that the granting of the Special Exception Use will not adversely affect the public interest.
2) Before any Special Exception Use approval is issued, the Board shall find that the proposed use is in compliance with supplemental regulations, if any, governing individual Special Exception Uses and shall consider the potential arrangement and provisions for the following:  a) Satisfactory ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control  b)      Provision of off-street parking and loading areas where required, with particular attention to the items in (a) and the economic, noise, glare, and odor effects of the use on adjoining properties in the area  c) Location and accessibility of refuse and service areas and their potentially adverse effects upon surrounding properties  d) Utilities, with reference to locations, availability and compatibility  e) Screening and buffering of potentially adverse views and activities from surrounding properties with reference to type, location, and dimensions  f) Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district  g) Location, use, plan, elevations and dimensions of each building or structure to be constructed  h) The bulk, density, and lot coverage of structures and the location, dimension, and arrangement of all open spaces and yards, with reference to their visual compatibility with surrounding properties i) General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property in the district  C. Conditions for Approval.
The Board may impose such conditions for approval that it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and the intent of the Comprehensive Master Plan and this Ordinance in relation to the items listed above and as may otherwise be reasonably necessary.
Such conditions shall apply to the land, structure, and use for which the special exception is granted and not to a particular person.
Violations of conditions lawfully attached to any special exception shall be deemed to be violations of this Ordinance.
2.5.5.
Variances.
The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, building or structures in the same district, or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance.
It is the intent of this Ordinance that variances be used only to overcome some physical condition of a parcel of land, which poses a practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
A.
Application.
An application for a variance shall be made on forms made available by and filed with the Zoning Official or Secretary of the Board at least twenty-one (21) days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board.
B. Variances within Areas Subject to Flooding.
Any application for a variance related to regulations and restrictions to property development and use due to said property’s location within a Special Flood Hazard District shall follow the process provided within the City’s adopted Flood Ordinance.
C. Variance Review Standards.
Variances may be granted in individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Board that all of the following conditions exist:  1) There are exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
2) A personal hardship exists on the part of an individual property owner which will not permit him to enjoy the full utilization of his property which is given to others without the city.
It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater value or profit would result if the variance were granted.
3)      Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other residents of the district in which the property is located.
4) A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district in which the property is located.
5) The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent neighborhood.
6) The hardship is not self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases the property with or without knowledge of the restrictions.
7) The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
8) The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which is not permitted in the district involved.
§2.6.
Appeals.
Appeals from the decisions of the Zoning and Building Officials shall be heard by the Board, unless otherwise specified in this Ordinance.

Article 3.
General REGULATIONS §3.1.
Districts.
For the purposes stated in the preliminary provisions of this Ordinance, the City is divided into districts of such number, shape, and area, and of such common unity of purpose, adaptability or use, which are deemed most suitable to provide for the best, general civic use, protect the common rights and interests within each district, preserve the general rights, and interests of all; and by further regulations to limit the location, uses and occupancy of buildings, structures and land to be used for trade, industry, residence or other structures, including the ration of lot occupancy and coverage, street setback lines, sizes of yards, and other open spaces.
3.1.1.
Traditional and Conventional Zones Distinguished   A.
Purpose and Intent  For the purposes of implementing the goals and objectives in the land use plan, the city has traditional and Conventional Zones.
Where indicated, the design and development standards in this chapter establish different standards for new development or redevelopment in either Traditional Zones or Conventional Zones.
Different standards are established in recognition of the need to:   1) Distinguish between portions of the city that have developed or will develop more in keeping with conventional or traditional neighborhood development principles;   2) Preserve and enhance the character of the downtown and established surrounding neighborhoods; and   3) Provide development standards that are more reflective of the city’s existing or planned character.
B.
General Characteristics of Traditional and Conventional Zones  Unless otherwise stated or modified through Planned Unit Developments, new development occurring within the city shall be compatible with the general characteristics of the area in which it is located.
1) Traditional Zone  Portions of the city designated as traditional zones typically include development with the following characteristics:   a) A modified grid street system with a prevalent use of alleys and use of cul-de-sac streets only where topography or other natural constraints exist;   b) Lots with variable sizes, widths, and orientations in proximity to one another along with the provision of formal open spaces;   c) Human-scaled buildings with high quality exterior materials located within proximity or adjacent to the primary streets they front;   d) Pedestrian and transit orientation, with widespread provision of on-street parking and off-street surface parking areas located beside or behind buildings; and   e) Integrated residential and nonresidential land uses located in the same building or in proximity to one another without extensive buffering.
2) Conventional Zones   Portions of the city designated as conventional zones typically include development with the following characteristics:   a)      Curvilinear streets with some cul-de-sacs and alleys serving narrow lots or areas subject to environmental constraints;   b) Lots with relatively uniform widths and sizes along with formal and informal open space areas;   c) Both pedestrian and automobile-oriented streetscapes including some lots fronted by surface parking lots located between the street and the building they serve;   d) Nonresidential developments typically set back from the streets they front and extended in strip form along streets; and   e) Segregation of different land uses into groups of similar type separated from other types by buffering and location.
C. Location   1) The geographic extents of traditional and conventional zones shall be depicted on the zoning map.
All lots in the city shall have a traditional or conventional zoning designation.
Some lots may be indicated as being appropriate for either designation but the standards shall not be mixed within a single lot or development.
2) Applicants considering new development or redevelopment should consult the Engineering Services and Community Development to determine the applicability of traditional or conventional zoning standards.
D. Applicability   1) Lots located within a traditional zone shall be subject to the traditional standards of this ordinance as well as all general requirements.
2) Lots located within a conventional zone shall be subject to the conventional standards of this ordinance as well as all general requirements.
3) All applications, Development Plans, Preliminary Plats, Final Plats, or Site Plans (as appropriate) shall indicate the applicable zoning district.
4) In cases where a development or design standard in this ordinance does not indicate its applicability to lots in conventional or traditional zones, then that standard shall be considered a general requirement and apply to all lots regardless of zone.
3.1.2.
Establishment of Zoning Districts.
In order to classify, regulate, and restrict the location of buildings designed for specific uses, to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or structurally altered, to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of the land area, and to regulate and determine the areas of open spaces within and surrounding such buildings, the City is hereby divided into the following districts:  A.
Traditional Districts  DWTN Downtown District  TI Traditional Institutional  HN Historic Neighborhood  TN-1 Traditional Neighborhood 1  TN-2 Traditional Neighborhood 2  TN-3 Traditional Neighborhood 3  TB Traditional Business  T-PUD  Traditional Planned Unit Development B.
Conventional Residential Districts  EST Estate Residential and Agricultural District  R-1 (1) Low Density Single Family Residential District  R-1 (2) Medium Density Single Family Residential District  R-1 (3) High Density Single Family Residential District  R-1 (4) Single Family Duplex Attached Residential District R-1 (5) Single Family Townhouse Attached Residential District  R-2 (1) Multiple Family Residential District R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District B-1 Neighborhood Business District B-2 General Business District  INST Institutional District  M-1 Light Industrial District  M-2 General Industrial District  C-PUD  Conventional Planned Unit Development District §3.2.
Zoning Map  The boundaries of the districts are as shown on the "Athens Zoning Map," together with any subsequent zoning map amendments.
Unless otherwise shown on said zoning map, the boundaries of districts are lot lines, the center lines of streets or alleys or such lines extended, railroad right- of-way lines, or corporate limit lines.
The zoning map and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon are a part of this ordinance.
Such map shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Official and shall show thereon the date of adoption and revisions of said map.
§3.3.
Interpretation of district boundaries.
The zoning administrator shall make an interpretation of the “Athens Zoning Map" upon request of any person.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps, the following rules shall apply:  3.3.1.
Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley lines or land lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
3.3.2.
In unsubdivided property or tracts where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on such maps.
3.3.3.
Where boundaries are approximately parallel to public right-of- way lines, such boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto.
3.3.4.
In case any further uncertainty exists, the board of adjustment shall determine the location of boundaries.
§3.4.
General Use Requirements.
3.4.1.
Application of this ordinance: No structure shall be construed, erected, placed or maintained and no land use commenced or continued within the city except as specifically or by necessary implication, authorized by this ordinance.
3.4.2.
Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance:   A.
No land or structure may be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located.
B.
No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in conformity with the area and height regulations of the district in which the building is located.
C. The minimum building lines, parking spaces, open spaces, and lot areas, required by this ordinance for each existing building or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be encroached upon nor reduced.
D. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on one lot.
However, this ordinance specifically permits more than one building on a lot, in the case of attached dwellings, and uses which require development plan approval.
Townhouses shall be constructed as one building on more than one lot.
E. On-frame modular buildings are only permitted within the R-MH District.
3.4.3.
Temporary structures for uses incidental to construction work may be permitted in any district during the period that construction work is in progress, but such temporary structures shall be removed upon completion or abandonment of the construction work.
Approval by the BZA shall be required for the location, placement, installation, movement or use of any portable or temporary building beyond those used for construction purposes.
The approval shall specify the approved use of the building and the temporary period for which the permit is to remain valid, up to 2 years.
3.4.4.
Utility structures including, but not limited to, poles, wires, cross arms, transformers attached to poles, guy wires, insulators, conduits and other facilities necessary for the transmission or distribution of electric power or to provide telephone, telegraph, internet, or cable television service and pipe lines, vents, valves, hydrants, regulators, meters and other facilities necessary for the transmission or distribution of gas, oil, water or other fluids may be constructed, erected, repaired, maintained or replaced within any district within the City of Athens.
This is not to be construed to include the erection or construction of buildings or electric substations.
§3.5.
Nonconforming Uses and Buildings 3.5.1.
Statement of Intent.
Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures, which were lawful when established, but which would be prohibited or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment.
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
3.5.2.
Expansion.
Nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended.
Buildings not meeting height requirements are exempt from this rule notwithstanding the rule for restoration found in Sec.
3.5.3.A below.
In such instances, the building may be added onto at the same height of the nonconforming structure so long as the addition does not exceed 25% of the GFA of the nonconforming structure.
Nonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
3.5.3.
Continuance.
A nonconforming use or building lawfully existing at the effective date of this ordinance may be continued, except as hereafter provided, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance.
A.
Restoration after damages: Other than detached dwellings, no nonconforming building or structure which has been damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement value prior to the time of such damage, shall be repaired or restored except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
However, for buildings or structures not damaged or destroyed beyond fifty (50) percent of its replacement value prior to the time of such damage, they may be repaired and used as before if repairs are initiated in twelve (12) months and completed within two (2) years of such damage.
B. Abandonment: A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a continuous period in excess of 180 days shall not be reestablished, and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
C. Change in use: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
A nonconforming use which is changed to a conforming use shall not be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
3.5.4.
Nonconforming Lots.
There exist lots in the city, which were lawful when platted, but which are too small to be developed under the provisions of this ordinance.
(Nonconforming lot(s) of record.)
Said lots may be vacant or occupied by an existing building or structure.
It is the intent of this ordinance to maintain the average lot width and developed density within each of the city's subdivisions or districts.
A.
Consolidation of Lots of Record.
If two (2) or more lots or parcels are adjacent or contiguous to each other and are under common ownership on the effective date of this ordinance, or subsequent thereto, such adjacent or contiguous lots or parcels shall be combined to form one (1) lot or parcel [hereinafter referred to as "zoning lot(s)"] and shall be considered one (1) zoning lot for purposes of complying with the Athens Zoning Ordinance minimum lot width and area requirements, if any such individual lot(s) do not meet said minimum requirements.
No zoning lot(s), or any portion thereof, shall be used in any way that conflicts with the regulations or requirements of this ordinance.
No building permit shall be issued for construction on any nonconforming lot or portion of any zoning lot(s) that is sold, transferred, or conveyed in violation of the provision of this ordinance and/or of this section, provided however, that this provision shall not prevent the dividing of presently existing townhouses or other multifamily dwellings into separate ownership units.
The provisions of this section are intended to apply to all nonconforming lots or parcels whether shown on an approved or recorded plot or plan.
No building permit shall be issued for any zoning lot(s), or any portion thereof, until such time as said zoning lot is resurveyed so as to create one (1) or more lots or parcels which conform with the provisions of this ordinance which include, but are not limited to, the minimum lot width or frontage and area requirements of the district in which such property is located.
B.
Area and Setback Modifications for Lots of Record.
Where a lot of record at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance had less area or less width than required for the applicable district, said lot may nonetheless be used as a building site provided the yard space and other requirements conform to the requirements for the applicable district.
If the lot is of insufficient size to accommodate the required yards, said yards may be adjusted with a plot plan, drafted by a professional surveyor or engineer, approved by the Zoning Official as follows: 1) For front yard modifications, see Sec.
6.1.8 Transitional Features.
2) If modifications are required for side yards, the plot plan will need to note the percentage difference between the actual width of the lot and the minimum width (frontage) required in the district.
The side yards may then be reduced in width by that percentage to the nearest foot.
3) If modifications are required for rear yards, the plot plan will need to note the percentage difference between the actual size of the lot and the minimum size required in the district.
The rear yard may then be reduced in depth by that percentage to the nearest foot.
4) If these remedies still present a case where hardships remain as defined in this ordinance, relief may be sought from the BZA.
5) If it appears that these remedies will present outcomes counter to the intent of this ordinance, the Zoning Official reserves the right to forward the request for relief to the BZA.
3.5.5.
Nonconforming Open Uses of Land.
This category of nonconformance consists of lots used for storage yards, used car lots, auto wrecking, junk yards, and similar open uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental and accessory to the open use of the lot and where such use of the land is not permitted to be established hereafter, under this Ordinance, in the applicable district.
A legally established nonconforming open use of land may be continued except as follows:  A.
When a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter revert to any nonconforming use.
B. Nonconforming open uses of land shall not be changed to any but conforming uses.
C. A nonconforming open use of land shall not be enlarged to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming.
D. A nonconforming open use of land shall not become a nuisance, as defined in Article 9.
3.5.6.
Nonconforming Improvements.
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, nonconforming improvements, including but not limited to, parking areas, driveways, lighting, sidewalks, building materials, buffers and screening, and other landscaping, shall be brought into conformity with the standards of this Ordinance and of the Subdivision Regulations according to the following:  A.
Where the use of a property becomes discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, all nonconforming improvements shall be brought into conformity with this Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations.
B.
In the event there is a change in the use of a property, regardless of whether the proposed use constitutes an increase in intensity, at a minimum, landscaping, screening, off-street parking areas, and exterior lighting shall be brought into conformity with the applicable provisions of Article 6.
C. In the event that there is a change in the use of a property such that the proposed use would require a greater buffer (from abutting uses) than the existing use, a buffer shall be provided as required in Article 6.
Where due to the location of a existing buildings and/or other site constraints, the buffer width cannot be met, a Variance may be issued by the Board, in which case the Board shall require a wall/fence and landscaping at a greater density to achieve a buffer configuration consistent with the intent of Article 6.
D. In the event that a change in the use of a property causes an increase in the number of uses, regardless of whether the proposed uses constitutes an increase in intensity, all nonconforming improvements shall be brought into conformity with this Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations.
§3.6.
Abandoned right-of-way.
Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the City of Athens, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of same and all area included therein shall then be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended district.
§3.7.
Necessary Repairs Permitted.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful condition of any part of any building or structure declared to be unsafe or unlawful.
§3.8.
Occupancy.
No building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations specified for the district of this Ordinance in which it is located.
3.8.1.
Occupancy in dwelling units.
Occupancy of a dwelling unit shall be limited to one family as defined herein, and in no case shall a dwelling unit be occupied by more than one family.
For a family who has a handicapped member, in case of extreme hardship, the family may request a variance to secure additional domestic help and state in writing a particular hardship and need for services of additional domestic help by making application to the Board of Zoning Adjustments or as otherwise required by the Federal Housing Act Amendment of 1988, as amended.
3.8.2.
Businesses.
Businesses shall occupy permanent principal buildings as defined in Article 9.
This provision shall not apply to activities in relation to a non-profit organization or event; special events hosted by a business entity lasting no more than 2 days; special events approved by the Mayor; the sale of prepackaged frozen food items; produce stands, provided the stand’s location is not deemed unsafe by the Athens Police Department; food truck courts permitted by Special Exception in Industrial District or as permitted by conditional rezoning; and activities taking place at the Farmers’ Market.

Uses on Appeal (Including Supplemental Regulations).
A use allowed on appeal is a use which is compatible with the permitted district uses but, because of its nature, must be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Official or the Board of Zoning Adjustments prior to issue of a business license.
Such uses fall into two (2) separate categories: (1) uses which are specifically mentioned in this ordinance as subject to supplemental use regulations and requiring approval by the Zoning Official; and (2) uses requiring Special Exception approval by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.
3.9.1.
Supplemental Use Regulations.
All uses identified as subject to Supplemental Use Regulations shall comply with all applicable standards for the uses as specified within this Article in addition to other requirements of this Ordinance.
A.
Home occupations   1)  Background and Intent.

6) Mixture of Uses and/or Densities.
Master Plans are required to have a mixture of land uses and/or densities.
Pick one development pattern from the following:  a) Two (2) residential densities in roughly equal proportions, with neither exceeding 70% of the total area, and at least one (1) non-residential use.
b) Three (3) or more residential densities in roughly equal proportions, with no one residential use exceeding 40% of the total area.
c) Primarily non-residential development, 75% of total land area, with incidental residential use.
B.
Development Incentives.
1) Development Incentives shall be provided to developer of qualified master plans upon the written request.
Incentive is granted by approving authority of additional development capacity in exchange for a public benefit or amenity.
Providing incentives is not just beneficial for the developer, but to the adjacent development, and the public.
The need for incentives will vary for different planned developments.
Therefore, the allocation of incentives shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.
Incentives and Public Benefits / Exchange are listed in the table below: 	Incentives & Public Benefits / Exchange  	Incentives  	Reduced Setbacks:  Reduction in front and side setback requirements for single-family residential uses as long as the minimum front yard setback is at least ten (10) feet and no porch encroaches into this 10-foot front setback.
The side yards shall not be less than five (5) feet.
The request for setback incentives shall not result in encroachment of any structures into a required landscaping buffer, stream buffer, or other environmentally sensitive areas.
Reduction in Minimum Lot Width: A reduction up to 20% in the minimum lot width for single-family detached and zero lot line residential lots.
No reduction shall be allowed for lots located in a cul-de-sac or along the curvature of a street.
Increase of Building Height:  An increase to allow for one (1) additional story / fifteen (15) feet above the designated district.
Must meet approval of Fire Inspector.
Modifications to Standard Street Section:  Green street, potentially reduction in lane widths without on-street parking, shall require a tree and shrub planting strip between road and sidewalk.
Removal of curb and gutter in low density development.
Approval of the City Engineer or Street Superintendent.
Public Benefit / Exchange  	Open Space Improvements: Improvements to greenway/open space such as pedestrian paths, bike trails, and street lighting along pedestrian paths and bike trails.
Improvements must be approved by the Zoning Official and the Parks and Recreation Director.
Increased Open Space: A 25% increase in open space beyond the minimum required open space for the development site (required acreage of open space × 25%).
The additional open space shall be comprised of undisturbed natural open space.
Vegetated buffers along the perimeter cannot count toward the increased open space requirement.
In addition, stream buffers, utility easements and other easements required by the City of Athens shall not count as open space under this incentive.
Moreover, this exchange can be offered twice for two incentives.
For example, a developer can offer a 50% increase over the minimum required open space for his development site in exchange for two incentives of his choice.
Park and Recreation Areas: A minimum of five acres of useable park space to be developed and maintained primarily for both active and passive recreational pursuits, including but not limited to tot-lots, playgrounds, neighborhood parks, and play fields.
These five acres can be dispersed throughout the development site, as long as the total acreage of park and recreational areas is equivalent to five acres.
Improvements shall not be permitted in the increased open space cited above but shall be permitted on the land allocated to meet the minimum open space requirement under the base zone designation.
Proposed improvements must be approved by the Zoning Official and Parks and Recreation Director.
This exchange cannot be offered in conjunction with the open space improvement unless approved by the Director of Parks and Recreation.
The parks and recreation areas must be owned and maintained by the developer and/or a homeowners’ association.
Dedicated Open Space: Land allocated and dedicated to the City for future parks and public greenways in accordance with the City’s Transportation Plan and Future Land Use Plan.
The land must be dedicated after the Master Plan is approved by the City Council and prior to the first preliminary plat submission.
Complete Streets: Build infrastructure that accommodates pedestrian, bicycles, and optional may accommodate low-speed wheeled vehicles such as golf carts.
On any street with more than 1,500 vehicle trips per day at full buildout, with a speed limit of 25 MPH or greater, having more than 2 lanes, or having the center lane marked, there must be additional infrastructure to accommodate bicycles.
Such acceptable infrastructure includes 10-foot multi-use trail separated from a road or bicycle lanes that are separated by a physical barrier.
Bicycle parking is required at all non-residential facilities.
The access street for this development also requires improvement by the development to make that portion a complete street.
In accordance with City’s Transportation Plan.
Affordable Housing:   Provide affordable housing for 20% of total number of dwelling units within the development.
In order for units to be considered affordable housing, it must be priced for an Annual Median Income of 80% or less for the Huntsville, Alabama MSA as determined by most recent HUD statistics.
Housing shall comprise of no more than 30% of that total income.
HOA fees and property taxes must be included in the 30% of total income.
Owner occupied must be priced to fall into the affordable range with a mortgage.
The applicant will obtain a letter from a bank with an office within Limestone County of the monthly payments and how those were calculated including credit rating and percent interest.
Rental units must be maintained in that range and can be annually adjusted based on HUD.
(This does not apply to developments where non-residential uses takes up fifty percent (50%) or greater of land area.)
2) No request for an incentive shall be accepted unless an exchange/public benefit is offered.
An exchange is a public benefit or amenity provided by an applicant or developer for additional development capacity.
The developer shall have the option of choosing from the list the exchange to offer the incentive  3) A planned development shall be allowed only two development incentives.
The entire area shown on a Master Development Plan shall constitute a planned development site for the purpose of allocating incentives and exchanges.
4) Requests for incentives and the reasons therefore shall be set forth by the applicant in the application for C-PUD approval.
The applicant shall explain in their request how each incentive would benefit, and not be detrimental, to the public interest.
The benefits derived from the exchange may not necessarily impact the development itself.
5) No incentives may be allowed when the proposed modifications would result it:  a) Traffic volumes exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity of the planned development.
b) An undue burden on community facilities, such as schools, fire and protection, utilities, and other such facilities.
c) Detrimental impact on surrounding land uses.
d) Incompatibility with the goals of the Future Land Use Plan.
e) Negative impact on the local watersheds.
6) Staff will review each request for incentive as requested and address the above findings in the staff report.
The burden of proof that these criteria are not being violated shall rest with the applicant and not the staff.
7) Development incentives, if granted, shall supersede the applicable regulations on the lots indicated on the master plan.
8) All incentives requested and exchanges / public benefits must be shown on the Master Development Plan as presented to the Planning Commission and/or City Council for approval.
Incentives shall become a component of the Master Development Plan and shall be binding upon all future development on the site.

6.1.8.
Transitional Features  A.
Purpose and Intent.
Transitional features are architectural elements or site aspects used to provide a transition between land uses, subdivisions, and sites in an effort to mitigate conflicts and to provide design compatibility.
It is the intent of these standards to:   1) Blend new development with existing development form and pattern;   2) Reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, form, or architecture;   3) Limit the excessive consumption of available land though the utilization of large vegetated buffers;   4) Limit interruptions in vehicular and pedestrian connections created by efforts to segregate uses; and   5) Establish or maintain vibrant pedestrian-oriented areas where differing uses can operate in proximity to one another.
B. Applicability   1) Transitional features shall be required:   a) When design compatibility cannot be achieved between land uses, lots, or structures; or   b) Between lots or uses within a single mixed-use development located in either traditional or Conventional Zones.
2) In Conventional Zones, the DRT may require the use of transitional features in addition to the use of a buffer, in accordance with the standards in Section 6.2.6, where such transitional features are necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, form, or architecture.
If the applicant disagrees with the decision of the DRT regarding the use of transitional features, the applicant may appeal the decision Planning Commission and/or Council, depending on the type of application.
3) In Traditional Zones, the DRT may require the use of a buffer in-lieu of or in addition to the use of a transitional feature where such buffer is necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, form, or architecture.
If the applicant disagrees with the decision of the DRT regarding the use of buffers or transitional features, the applicant may appeal the decision to Planning Commission and/or Council, depending on the type of application.
C. Standards.
In areas where existing blocks or 500 ft long frontages including the subject property are at least 75% developed, and a transition between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, setbacks, form, or architecture is needed, the following approaches shall be used, subject to the approval of the Zoning Official and the Building Department, to establish a transition between uses and buildings:   1) For differing uses, use setbacks that are within 25 percent of the average setbacks for existing uses on the same block face provided no new use is closer to the right-of-way than the closest existing principal structure; 2) In residential districts or developments (no differing uses), no building shall be set back more, or located closer to the street, than the average of the setbacks of the existing dwellings on the same side of the street, within the same block or two hundred fifty (250) feet each side thereof, whichever is less.
Figure 6-2: The new construction (outlined in red) on the right demonstrates appropriate average setbacks.
The dwelling outlined in red on the left has a front setback that is too deep.
3) Use lot widths that are within 40 percent of the average lot width for existing lots on the same block;   4) Ensure the perceived façade width and height on façades of adjacent structures and structures on opposing sides of a street are consistent with each other such that neither façade exceeds the other’s dimensions by more than 25 percent;  Figure 6-3: Ensuring similar façade height and width dimensions of opposing façades can be an effective means of establishing a transition between uses.
5) Graduate building height, scale, and mass through utilization of any of the following methods:   a) Building step-backs to reduce the bulk of a building’s upper floors;    b) Dividing buildings into smaller parts, including detached buildings, to reduce effective visual bulk and to maintain the scale and rhythm of the existing pattern of development;   c) Sight lines or angular planes to gauge the appropriate building height necessary to achieve a steady, incremental transition; or   d) Other techniques to break up the scale of a building to complement existing development patterns, as approved by the DRT or the Department of Neighborhood Services.
Figure 6-4: Step-backs in building heights between different use types can be an effective transitional element.
6) Use similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows, doors, awnings, arcades, pilasters, cornices, wall offsets, building materials, and other building articulations included on the lower intensity use as depicted in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-5: The example on the bottom demonstrates effective use of transition features.
7) Locate off-street parking, loading, service, and utility areas in a manner consistent with similar site features on surrounding sites.
When adjacent to residential areas, off-street parking, loading, service, and utility areas shall be strategically located to mitigate disturbance to nearby residents.
Additionally, loading and service areas shall not front a street and shall be screened in accordance with Subsections 6.2.5, Perimeter Landscape Standards, and 6.2.8 Screening;   8) Prevent incompatible exterior lighting or sources of audible noise or disturbance from building façades facing lower intensity uses;   9) Prevent abrupt changes in roof form by allowing adjacent incompatible uses to use similar roof types, slopes, or arrangements;   10) Orient outdoor dining, gathering areas, and other site attributes such as, vending machines, away from adjacent residential uses;   11) Orient primary building façades directly across from opposing primary façades regardless of use type (as seen in Figure 6-8); and  Figure 6-6: Organizing buildings so that the primary façades face one another can serve as a transitional feature when two different building types occupy opposing sides of a street.
12) When dealing with multi-building developments on one or more lots, establish a continuum of use intensity where uses of moderate intensity (colored orange in Figure 6-7) are sited between high-intensity uses (colored brown in Figure 6-9) and low-intensity uses (colored yellow in Figure 6-7) (e.g., office uses between retail and detached residential).
Figure 6-7: Multi-building developments can be organized to concentrate the highest intensity uses in a single area and feather the intensity and density outwards from high intensity centers.
6.1.9.
Residential Development.
Attached and detached residential structures shall comply with the following basic residential design standards.
A.
Basic Standards   1) Building Compatibility   a) Traditional Zones   (i) Residential development in Traditional Zones shall be physically integrated with surrounding residential structures through the use of design compatibility, including elements such as appropriate scale, setbacks, materials, roof forms, lot sizes, and streetscape.
Figure 6-8: The detached dwelling in the foreground exhibits compatibility with the surrounding dwellings in regard to design, scale, setbacks, and materials.
(ii) When design compatibility cannot be achieved between two or more different residential use types (e.g., detached and attached residential uses), transitional features as set forth in Subsection  6.1.8 shall be provided.
b) Conventional Zones.
Within Conventional Zones, either transitional features or buffers (See Subsection 6.2.6, Buffers.)
shall be used between adjacent but differing residential use types (e.g., detached and attached residential uses).
2) Building Orientation.
All residential development within Traditional Zones shall be located parallel to the associated street or be consistent with existing development patterns rather than being sited at unconventional angles, unless irregular lot layouts require alternative orientations.
Figure 6-9: This image depicts dwellings that are parallel to the street and consistent with one another.
3) Setbacks.
Setbacks should be in accordance with Article 4, Traditional Zoning Regulations, or Article 5, Conventional Zoning Regulations.
4) Façade Standards  a) Primary façade materials shall not change at outside corners and shall continue along any side façade visible from a street right-of-way; however, materials may change where side or rear wings meet the main body of the dwelling.
Figure 6-10: The Dwelling on the left demonstrates appropriate exterior wrapping, while the image on the right depicts a dwelling with inappropriate material changes at the corner of the building.
b) Materials changes shall occur along a horizontal line or where two forms meet.
It is acceptable, however, that change of materials occur as accents around windows, doors, cornices, at corners, or as a repetitive pattern.
Figure 6-11: This image demonstrates how material changes should occur along straight lines.
5) Foundations.
a) For homes within the Traditional Zoning Districts, the finished floor elevation at the front façade shall be located above grade in accordance with the following standards:   (i) For setbacks of ten feet or more, the finished floor elevation of the front facade shall be a minimum of 12 inches above grade; and   (ii) For setbacks of less than ten feet, the finished floor elevation of the front facade shall be a minimum of 24 inches above grade.
Figure 6-12: Residential structures incorporate raised foundations, as depicted in the photo to the right, to give a vertical orientation and well-proportioned appearance, as well as to provide privacy for occupants.
b) Exposed foundation walls or piers shall be clad in face brick, stone, stucco, or some other masonry material accurately imitating these materials.
Smooth-faced standard concrete block is prohibited unless troweled with a stucco-like finish to a thickness in which the joints of the block are not visible.
c) In cases where piers are used, painted or stained latticework screening shall be installed between piers on front and side building façades.
d) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the use of slab foundations, provided:   (i) The outer edge of the slab is clad in the materials required in this subsection; and   (ii) It extends to the minimum height above grade required in traditional zones.
6) Porches.
If porches are provided, they shall have a minimum useable depth of at least four (4) feet.
7) Windows.
Windows on primary façades shall be vertically proportioned so that the vertical dimension is greater than the horizontal dimension, and vertically aligned between floors.
Exceptions may be approved to accomplish a particular architectural theme, such as in the prairie style.
Where used, shutters shall be proportioned to cover one-half the width of the window from each side or the total window from one side.
Figure 6-13: The drawing on the right demonstrates appropriate vertical alignment for windows.
8) Materials   a) Materials permitted in Traditional Zones are listed in Article 4, Traditional Zone Regulations.
b) Developments with more than one residential structure shall use materials that are compatible with one another.
c) The use of aluminum siding, corrugated metal siding, or exposed smooth-faced concrete block is prohibited.
High-quality metal siding (e.g., stainless steel, copper, brushed nickel, brass, etc.)
may be approved for use on a case-by-case basis.
d) Vinyl siding and synthetic stucco (EIFS) shall be subject to the following limitations in all zones except the HN District:   (i) Vinyl siding is allowed on eaves and soffits.
(ii) These materials are prohibited at any point within 30 inches of the exterior finished grade level  (iii) If used, it must be above a brick, stone, split face block, or masonry that extends from exterior finished grade to 30 inches above exterior finished grade, or to the bottom of the windows, whichever measurement is greater.
Masonry materials that do not meet this requirement are smooth-faced block (prohibited by [c]) and faux masonry veneer.
(iv) Accessory structures must have brick, stone, split face block, masonry that extends from exterior finished grade level to 30 inches above exterior finished grade level.
Masonry materials that do not meet this requirement are smooth-faced block (prohibited by [c]) and faux masonry veneer.
e) Vinyl siding and synthetic stucco (EIFS) shall be subject to the following limitations in the HN District: (i) Vinyl siding is allowed on eaves and soffits.
(ii) Accessory structures are allowed to match the materials of a detached house, with the same limitations as 6.1.9.A(8)(d)(iv).
f) Where two or more materials are proposed to be combined on a facade, the heavier and more massive elements shall be located below the lighter elements (i.e., brick shall be located below stucco).
It is acceptable to provide the heavier material as a detail on the corner of a building or along cornices or windows.
Figure 6-14: These homes demonstrate how heavier materials (brick) should be located below lighter materials (wood siding).
g) The exposure width of horizontal siding shall be no more than six inches.
h) The exterior building material of chimneys shall not be siding (vinyl or fibrous cement), and shall either:   (i) Match the building material of the foundation; or   (ii) Be stone or brick.

6.1.10.
Detached Residential Structures.
In addition to the basic standards for all residential development, detached residential structures shall comply with the following:   A.
Reverse Frontage Discouraged   1) Generally   a) Except for circumstances listed in Subsection 6.1.10.A(2), Acceptable Situations, residential lots with a reverse frontage are generally discouraged, particularly in Traditional Zones.
b) Lots along the perimeter of a subdivision should generally be oriented so that dwellings front perimeter streets or open space instead of backing up to streets around the outside of the subdivision.
This is particularly important for lots fronting local streets internal to a development.
2) Acceptable Situations.
Reverse frontage is acceptable for residential structures on lots in the following locations, provided the rear of the dwelling is properly screened:   a) Lots or sites fronting freeways, arterial, or collector streets in Conventional Zones; and   b) Existing platted lots in residential subdivisions or Planned Unit Developments approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
3) Screening for Reverse Frontage.
Residential developments with reverse frontage lots shall provide a Type A Buffer between the lots and the public street.
(See Figure 6-54).
Figure 6-15: The image on the top demonstrates appropriate screening for reverse frontage lots.
Fences or walls without landscape are inappropriate.
4) Alternatives to Reverse Frontage.
The use of a parallel access drive is an alternative to reversed frontage.
Where curb cuts for driveways are not an option along the associated street, access by rear alleys is another alternative in Traditional Zones.
Figure 6-16: Rear alleys can be used as an alternative to reverse frontage lots.
B.
Lot Size.
Except where modified through the planned unit development process (See Subsection 2.4.2 .
), lots intended for new detached residential dwellings adjacent to existing lots intended for detached residential dwellings shall be no less than 75 percent of the average lot size of existing contiguous lots.
Figure 6-17: New lots intended for detached residential development should be of a comparable size to any abutting detached residential lots as a means of maintaining compatibility.
C. Primary Entrance Orientation 1) Detached residential development shall be oriented so that the primary entrance faces the street or an open space, such as a square.
2) In the case of corner lots, the primary entrance shall face the street from which the structure derives its street address.
3) Alternative orientations may be considered by the Planning Department in cases where such alternative orientations are consistent with existing adjacent development.
6.1.11.
Attached Residential Structures.
In addition to the basic standards for all residential development (See Subsection 6.1.9), attached dwellings shall comply with the following standards:   A. Orientation.
1) The primary entrance and front façade of individual buildings within an attached residential development shall be oriented towards the following (listed in priority order):   a) Perimeter streets;   b) Primary internal streets;   c) Common open space set-aside areas;   d) Parks or other common open space; and   e) Secondary internal streets.
Figure 6-28: This diagram demonstrates proper orientation of buildings within a multiple-building attached residential development.
2) Primary entrances or façades shall not be oriented towards off-street parking lots, garages, or carports.

2) The maximum length of any attached residential building, regardless of the quantity of dwellings, shall be 250 feet.
3) No more than six side-by-side townhouse dwelling units shall be attached in any single row.
4) All sides of a attached residential building visible from lands occupied by or designated for detached residential uses, an existing public street right-of-way, or other public lands shall display a similar level of quality and architectural detailing.
Figure 6-29: This attached residential structure exhibits a similar level of architectural detail on all sides visible from a street or from other detached residential uses.
5) Individual attached residential buildings served by common entryways and containing six or fewer units shall be constructed to give the appearance of a large single-family detached home.
Figure 6-30: This image demonstrates how an attached residential structure of six or fewer units can be constructed to appear as a large detached residential structure.
6) Attached residential developments with structures housing seven or more units per structure shall incorporate a variety of distinct building designs and shall be distinguished through the inclusion of a minimum of two of the following attributes:   a) A variation in length of 30 percent or more;   b) A variation in the size (square footage) of the building footprint by 30 percent or more;   c) A variation in color or in use of materials, or both;   d) A variation in the type of attached residential dwellings contained in the structure (e.g., vertically attached or horizontally stacked); or   e) A distinct variation in building height by at least 20 percent and roof form.
C. Height.
Except for structures located in areas subject to the traditional standards of this ordinance (See Subsection 6.1.4.
), buildings located within 100 feet of lands occupied by or designated for detached residential development shall not exceed two stories.
D. Building Wall Standards 1) Variation in building wall elevations shall be included on all attached residential building façades.
2) Long, monotonous, blocky, uniform, or repetitive building walls shall be prohibited.
Figure 6-31: This attached residential development lacks sufficient façade variation yielding a monotonous appearance.
3) Façades facing streets or containing the primary entrance(s) to dwellings shall provide a minimum of three of the following design features for each residential unit fronting onto a street:   a) Projections or recesses in the façade plane every 30 feet (with a minimum depth of two feet);   b) Different exterior building materials and/or colors for each unit (e.g.
alternating among brick, painted brick, siding, and stone);   c) One or more dormer windows or cupolas;   d) A recessed entrance;   e) A covered porch or balcony;   f) Pillars, posts, or pilasters;   g) One or more box or bay windows with a minimum twelve-inch projection from the façade plane;   h) Eaves with exposed rafters or a minimum six-inch projection from the façade plane;   i) Dormers;   j) A parapet wall with an articulated design rather than a simple rectilinear form; or   k) Multiple windows with a minimum four-inch wide trim.
Figure 6-32: These attached residential structures demonstrate how different materials, changes in wall planes, offsets, projections, recesses, and other architectural techniques can promote variety in building façades.
4) Building façades facing arterial streets shall include brick, stone, or siding (wood or fibrous cement) for a minimum of 75 percent of the net façade area.
5) Horizontal variations in materials along the façade of an attached residential building shall occur in conjunction with a change in wall plane, preferably at the inside corner of a wall.
E. Roof Forms   1) Attached residential structures shall incorporate roof pitches between 3:12 and 12:12; however, alternative roof forms or pitches may be allowed for small roof sections over porches, entryways, or similar features.
Figure 6-33: This image illustrates the difference between the maximum 12:12 roof pitch (top) and the minimum 3:12 roof pitch (bottom).
2) Parapet walls fronting a street shall include three-dimensional cornice treatments.
3) Roof forms shall be designed to correspond and denote building elements and functions such as entrances and arcades.
Figure 6-34: Roof forms can be used to denote building features such as entrances.
Parapet walls can add visual interest through the use of a three-dimensional cornice treatment.
F. Off-Street Surface Parking.
In addition to the standards in Section §6.5, Off-Street Parking and Loading, attached residential structures shall comply with the following:   1) No off-street surface parking shall be located between the structure and the street it fronts.
2) Off-street surface parking located on the side of a building shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the lot’s street frontage along the primary street.
In making that calculation, associated driving areas and driveways shall be included as part of such off-street surface parking.
Figure 6-35: Off-street surface parking lots located to the rear of a structure allow an active and cohesive streetscape to be maintained.
G. Garage Standards.
Attached and detached garages and carports shall comply with the following standards:   1) Garages and car ports serving attached residential structures shall be located to the side or rear of such buildings and shall be oriented perpendicular to the primary streets located around the perimeter of the development.
Figure 6-36: Garages serving attached residential structures must be oriented perpendicular to the primary streets serving the development to minimize their visual impact.
2) The Zoning Official may allow attached residential structures to include garage doors that face the primary street fronting the structure only in cases where it is necessary to retain existing vegetation or address difficult topography.
3) An attached or detached garage shall not project beyond the front of the primary façade of the dwelling it serves.
H. Streetscape Elements.
Streetscape elements (e.g., benches, trash receptacles, light fixtures, bollards, fountains, bicycle racks, etc.)

C. Building Façades.
Building façades shall comply with the following standards:   1) Rear and side façades, if visible from public streets, shall have a similar architectural treatment as used on the primary or front façade;   2) Blank building walls facing streets are prohibited;   3) Buildings shall have a defined base and cap; and   4) Remote walls that are not visible from a street and only visible from an alley, the rear yard of another nonresidential or mixed-use site, or completely hidden due to topography or natural features preserved in an open space lot shall be exempt from these requirements.
Figure 6-40: This building successfully blends the vertical height of the building with the horizontal banding of the base, middle, and cap.
5) Window and door openings shall have a vertical orientation and shall be vertically aligned between floors.
6) Within Traditional Zones, buildings shall be constructed (through the use of materials, design elements, or architectural details) to emphasize the proportion of height to width so that building façades are vertically oriented.
Figure 6-41: This image depicts a building with an orientation that is primarily horizontal, which is inappropriate for Traditional zones in Athens.
7) Where a clearly established development character and scale exist, new infill development shall include:   a) Window and door openings with area ratios and proportions similar to those on adjoining buildings; and   b) Key design elements of surrounding buildings with respect to windows, doors, rhythm of bays, detailing, roof forms, materials, and colors.
Figure 6-42: This building demonstrates successful integration as an infill structure into an existing context.
8) Prototypical or franchise designs shall be adapted to reflect the design standards of this subsection, the applicable district standards, and the character of the city.
Figure 6-43: This example of an alternative national restaurant chain store design shows how prototypical architecture can be modified to be consistent with local character.
D. Loading and Service Areas.
Except for M-1 and M-2 Districts or double frontage and/or corner lots, loading and service areas shall not front a public or private street and shall be screened in accordance with Paragraph 6.2.5.C Perimeter Landscape Standards and 6.2.8, Screening.
E. Façade Variations.
Buildings shall use wall offsets or other variations to break up the mass of a building, maintain building rhythm along a street, and to establish a human scale in accordance with the standards:   1) Traditional Zones.
Building façades containing the primary building entrance, visible from a street, or visible from land used by or intended for residential development shall incorporate façade variations a minimum of every 25 feet.
Figure 6-44: This building uses pilasters to divide a single façade into distinct vertically-oriented storefronts that maintain the building rhythm along the street.
2) Conventional Zones.
Building façades containing the primary building entrance, visible from a street, or visible from land used by or intended for residential development shall incorporate façade variations a minimum of every 35 feet; buildings over 20,000 square feet may increase the minimum requirement for façade variations to every 50 feet.
3) Exemptions.
Remote walls that are not visible from a street and only visible from an alley, the rear yard of another nonresidential or mixed-use site, or completely hidden due to topography or natural features preserved in an open space lot shall be exempt.
4) Standards.
The following shall be used either alone or in combination to meet the façade variation requirements and shall be applied in a manner that is integral to the building form and construction:   a) Color or material changes having a minimum width of ten feet with a minimum depth or projection of six inches beyond the primary façade plane;   b) Pilasters having a minimum depth of eight inches, a minimum width of eight inches, and a minimum height of 80 percent of the façade’s height; c) Awnings or canopies, provided the awning or canopy is not translucent, back-lit, or internally illuminated;   d) Arbors or trellises of materials and color complimentary to the primary building, provided the location of the arbor or trellis does not obstruct any type of access (pedestrian, handicap, emergency, loading, etc.
);   e) Windows and/or a change in fenestration;   f) Faux windows or areas of special brick, tile, or stone pattering, if window openings are not conducive to the use of the building;   g) Recessed entries, accented by canopies, awnings, porticos, or rood overhangs;   h) Balconies or decks, a minimum of 6 feet in depth and width;   i) Arcades or covered walkways;  j) Roofline changes, such as changes in roof planes or changes in the top of a parapet wall, when coupled with correspondingly aligned façade material changes;   k) For sloped roof buildings, varying the roofline through a knee wall or providing a six-inch or greater offset in the façade plane; or   l) Other architectural features, as approved by the DRT and/or Planning Commission.
Figure 6-45: This building on a lot within a conventional ZONES successfully uses arcades, wall offsets, and variations in roof line to break up the mass of the building and maintain a pedestrian orientation.
F. Building Materials   1) Basic Standards.
The following building materials standards shall apply to buildings containing commercial, office, civic and institutional, and mixed-uses:   a) Building façades of buildings three stories or less facing a major arterial street and Interstate 65 shall include brick, stone (real or faux), marble, or scored precast concrete for a minimum of 75 percent of the net façade area.

I. Off-Street Parking Location   1) Traditional Zones.
Nonresidential and mixed-use structures in Traditional Zones shall comply with standards found in Article 4, Traditional Zone Regulations.
2) Conventional Zones   a) Location   (i) On lots in Conventional Zones, with the exception of M-1 and M-2 zones and properties fronting major arterial roadways, the following applies:  · For parking lots of 100 parking spaces or less, off-street parking lots exceeding 60 feet in width (typically one aisle with two single-loaded bays) shall be prohibited between a building and the street it faces.
· For parking lots of more than 100 parking spaces, off-street parking lots exceeding 180 feet in width shall be prohibited between a building and the street it faces on lots in Conventional Zones that are located adjacent to street intersections.
(ii) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the width of off-street parking areas on such lots when the parking areas are located behind buildings or on sides not adjacent to a public street intersection.
Figure 6-46B: For lots of 100 parking spaces or less, limiting surface parking to a maximum width of 60 feet in front of a building helps to mitigate the visual impact of surface parking lots J.
Large-Scale Development.
Developments composed of one or more structures engaged in retail or wholesale sales each exceeding 20,000 square feet, or developments with a single large commercial establishment exceeding 20,000 square feet and one or more smaller additional structures shall comply with the standards in this subsection as well as the following:   1) Liner Buildings   a) A series of smaller “liner buildings” shall be positioned along the primary façade of the large structure to break up the structure’s mass.
b) As an alternative to liner buildings, the primary façade of a large-scale development structure can be designed to appear as multiple small storefronts, except that individual doorways shall not be required.
Figure 6-47: The mass of large-scale development can be made more human-scaled and pedestrian-friendly through the use of techniques like liner buildings or architecture replicating liner buildings as depicted here.
2) Parking Lots   a) Off-street surface parking lots serving large-scale development sites shall be designed to create the effect of internal “streets” through the use of landscape, island placement, and building location around drive aisles.
b) Off-street parking lots with 250 or more spaces shall include primary drive aisles.
c) Utility placement on sites with large parking lots shall be configured to allow for future infill of new buildings.
Figure 6-48: Parking areas serving large-scale developments with multiple buildings can be designed to create a series of internal “streets”.
3) Building Orientation.

Design Modifications   A.
Appeal of Design Standards   1) Design modifications may only be granted by the Planning Commission to the development standards of Subsections 6.1.8 through 6.1.14 (including the referenced subsections) as part of the Development Plan, or Site Plan review process, when such exceptions will enhance the appearance and design of commercial and multiple-family development and other development subject to review.
2) An applicant may request a design modification for developments in order to achieve a more desirable site development than would result if the requirements of this ordinance were strictly adhered to.
Design modifications may be granted under the provisions of subsection B, below.
3) Generally, design modifications are limited to minor changes of the provisions set forth in Subsections 6.1.8 through 6.1.14 (including the referenced subsections).
4) No design modification shall be granted under this section that would impact overall bulk lot requirements: for example, decrease the landscape surface ratio, decrease the number of required parking spaces, decrease the amount of required on-site landscape material, or decrease the required open space.
B.
Findings.
A request for design modification shall be submitted in writing by the applicant along with the initial filing of a plan.
The request shall state fully the grounds for the request and all of the facts upon which the applicant is relying.
The Planning Commission shall not grant a design modification unless it is found that the applicant has presented sufficient justification and documentation that:   1) The design modification will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;   2) The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the design intent for the development which the design modifications are sought and are not applicable generally to other property;   3) The design modification is necessary because of the particular design intent of the development, which would not be achievable if strict adherence to these requirements was carried out; and   4) The design modification will not vary the provisions of the Athens Land Use Plan.
C. Conditions.
In granting design modifications, reasonable conditions or restrictions may be imposed if appropriate or necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare, or convenience, and to secure the purposes of this ordinance.

Buffers   A.
Purpose.
Landscape buffers are intended for use when the impacts of incompatible uses cannot be mitigated through design compatibility concepts or transitional features.
B.
The following types of separation buffers are hereby established (see figure 6-54) and are required where noted on Table 6-1.
1) Type A - Solid wall with exterior landscaping.
(8’ minimum width) This buffer can be used to minimize the width of the separation buffer while maintaining a visual and auditory separation between uses.
A solid wall constructed of brick, stone, masonry, iron, wood, or products designed to resemble these materials shall be at least 6’ in height (10’ maximum height).
A 6’ wide landscape strip (minimum width) shall be located on the exterior side of the wall facing the adjacent properties.
One evergreen tree shall be installed for every 4 linear feet of wall.
One understory or ornamental tree can be substituted for every 4th evergreen, provided the tree is a minimum of 8’ tall and 3” in caliper.
2) Type B - Planting Screen.
(15’ minimum width) At maturity, intended to be a completely visually opaque barrier.
At a minimum, 3 staggered rows of evergreen trees spaced 5’ on center from one another shall fill the entire length of the buffer.
The vegetation used shall be designed to grow to a minimum height of 8 - 10 feet.
3) Type C - Semitransparent Greenspace.

At a minimum, the buffer shall contain trees planted at a maximum of 40’ on center from one another.
C. Responsibility for Buffer Installation  1) Vacant Parcels.
Where a developing parcel is adjacent to a vacant parcel zoned for incompatible uses, the developing parcel shall provide 50 percent of the perimeter buffer required adjacent to the vacant land.
2) Existing Land Uses   a) Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing use, the developing parcel shall provide the full perimeter buffer required adjacent to the existing use.
b) Where all or part of a perimeter buffer exists on the adjacent developed parcel, but the buffer does not fully comply with the standards of this subsection, the developing parcel shall be responsible for providing all the additional planting material necessary to meet the standards of this subsection.
c) If the existing developed parcel contains a buffer meeting the standards of this subsection, then the developing use is not required to provide a buffer.
Figure 6-54: Types of buffers.
3) Adjacent to Nonconforming Sites.
Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing lawfully established use that is more intense and has no buffer, then the developing use shall only be responsible for providing a maximum of 50 percent of the required landscape buffer.
D. Location of Buffers.
Buffers required by this subsection shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-of-way line; however, the buffer may be located along shared access easements between parcels in nonresidential developments.
E. Up to 25 percent of the vegetation within a buffer may be deciduous   F. Increase in Required Plantings.
Additional buffering may be required if the inspection for release of a Performance Agreement reveals that the buffering fails to meet the standards or intent of this subsection.
In no case shall the additional buffering and screening material, combined, exceed 10% of the total estimated cost of the landscaping on the site.
G. Development Within Required Buffers.

A.
Background.
Buffers adjacent to stream systems provide numerous environmental protection and resource management benefits that can include the following:  1) Restoring and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the water resources  2) Removing pollutants delivered from urban stormwater  3) Reducing erosion and sediment entering the stream  4) Stabilizing stream banks  5) Providing infiltration of stormwater runoff  6) Maintaining the natural flow of streams  7) Contributing the organic matter that is a source of food an energy for the aquatic ecosystem  8) Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic organisms  9) Providing riparian wildlife habitat  10) Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity  It is the desire of the City of Athens to protect and maintain the native vegetation in riparian and wetland areas by implementing specification for the establishment, protection, and maintenance of vegetation along all stream systems within our jurisdictional authority.
B. Definitions for this paragraph.
Streams and watercourses identified through site inspection by the City Engineer, or his designee, and US Geological Survey (USGS) maps.
1) Perennial streams are those which are depicted on a USGS map with a solid blue line, and has water in its channel at all times.
2) Intermittent streams are those which are depicted on a USGS map with a dotted blue line, and that flows only when it receives water from rainfall runoff or springs, or from some surface source such as melting snow.
3) Nontidal wetlands are those areas not influenced by tidal fluctuations that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
4) Ephemeral streams that flows only in direct response to precipitation; it receives little or no water from springs, melting snow, or other sources; its channel is at all times above the water table.
C. Stream Buffer Description and Permitted Uses  1) Streamside Zone  a) Function - Protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem.
b) Vegetative Target - Undisturbed natural vegetation.
c) Uses - Very restricted - Permitted uses limited to: flood control structures, utility easements*, natural footpaths, crossings, and approaches for paved roadways, and pedestrian paths and bikeways.
*As deemed necessary and approved by the City Engineer 2) Managed Use Zone  a) Function - Protects Key components of the stream and provides distance between upland development and the stream side zone.
b) Vegetative Target – Mature vegetation and native trees; exotic vegetation and underbrush may be removed and maintained.
c) Uses – Restricted – Permitted uses limited to: uses allowed in the Streamside Zone, as well as storm water best management practices (BMPs), biking and hiking paths (with natural or pervious surfaces), greenway trails, and limited tree clearing approved by the City Engineer.
3) Upland Zone  a) Function – Prevents encroachment and filter runoff from residential and commercial developments  b) Vegetative Target – Lawns, gardens, shrubs, and pervious landscaping features.
c) Uses – Restricted – Permitted uses limited to: all uses allowed in the Streamside and Managed Use Zones, as well as, grading for lawns, gardens, and gazebos and accessory structures.
No septic systems, principal structures or impervious surfaces are allowed.
4) Prohibited uses: Buildings and parking lots are prohibited within these zones, with the exception of buildings necessary for government function.
D. Stream Buffer Width Based on Drainage Areas  1) Minimums.
Table 6-1B sets forth the minimums for a stream buffer based on the drainage area.
Table 6-1B: Minimum Stream Buffer Width Based on Drainage Area  	Drainage Area (Watershed) Designation 	Streamside Zone 	Managed Use Zone 	Upland Zone 	Total Buffer Width on each side of Stream  	< 100 acres 	25 feet 	None 	10 feet 	35 feet  	≥ 100 acres 	25 feet 	None 	20 feet 	45 feet  	≥ 300 acres 	25 feet 	20 feet 	10 feet 	55 feet  	≥ 640 acres 	25 feet 	50 feet 	25 feet 	100 feet   2) Stream buffer Setback in Special Flood Hazard District Zones  a) Stream buffers designated with a FEMA Special Flood Hazard District Zone A or Zone AE shall horizontally encompassed the entire area of the Floodway and be designated as a streamside zone.
b) Where there is not a Floodway established, use the same measurements as specific in Code of Ordinances §14-118(3), No Encroachment, for the purpose of a Floodway for this Subsection and this area shall be designated as a streamside zone.
c) From the Floodway’s boundary, the Table 6-1B measurements add on to the back of that.
d) Example:  A Floodway for a creek with a 100-foot width on from the centerline of the stream which drains more than 640 acres.
For this creek, the streamside zone shall be 125 feet, the managed use zone shall be 50 feet, the upload zone shall be 25 feet.
The total stream buffer width on the one side of this stream shall be 200 feet.
3) Any hydrologically related nontidal wetland must encompass the wetland area as streamside and use the above table to establish streamside, mange use, and upload zones based on the drainage area.
Those zones shall start from the wetland’s boundary.
4) Non-perpendicular Utility Easements.
When a utility easement runs in a manner that is not perpendicular to the stream buffer, and the width is below the minimums set in the managed use zones in the table in Item (1) the additional width must be added to the stream buffer to compensate proportional to the amount of the easement.
5) Interpretations or special case areas that do not conform to the descriptions mentioned in the zoning ordinance shall be made by the City Engineer, or their designee.
E. Width of Pond/Lake Buffers  1) Identified as on the USGS topography map that are blue areas or water bodies that have a physical, chemical or biological connection to larger bodies of water downstream and could affect the integrity of those downstream waters  2) The streamside zone must encompass the entirety of the lake/pond plus 25 feet from the edge of the natural lake/pond elevation and the upland zone extend 10 feet from the streamside zone limits.
F. Where the boundary of two riparian buffers intersect, the most restrictive zone of Paragraph (C) shall rule.
G. Landscaping Buffers are a different development requirement handled in Subsection 6.2.6.
Stream buffers may count for open space requirements.
If inventoried, riparian buffers may count for a portion of landscaping requirements, if the trees are evergreen.
H. Starting from the streamside and managed use zones shall require:  1) Preservation of existing vegetation  2) Removal of invasive pest plants, see Item 6.2.3.B(7)(b),   3) Where forest vegetation is non-existent, follow the guidelines in the latest edition of the Alabama Low Impact Development Handbook (published by ADEM) for Riparian Buffers for establishing new vegetation.
Buffers damaged in the managed use zone shall be returned to their original condition.
I. Re-designation of a blue line stream must come from documents originating from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
J.
After development, vegetation within the buffer is to be preserved.
With exceptions as follows:  1) removal of individual invasive pest plants is encouraged, see Item 6.2.3.B(7)(b);  2) existing utilities services;  3) sewer services;  4) government function related to drainage and removal of dead or diseased trees.
K. Plans and Plats.
1) Any master plan, site development plan, or plat must contain a note that “Vegetation within stream/lake/pond zones is to be preserved.
Invasive pest plants are allowed to be removed using best practices for removal of that plant species near a water body.”   2) Preliminary plats and site development plans must do all of the following within the drawings:   a) designate streamside, managed use, and upland zones.
b) show the existence of riparian forest or the re-establishment of a riparian forest.
c) show any development within buffers designated within this subsection.
L. Stream buffers are not absolute conservation easements.
Where there are other requirements and goals set forth by the Zoning Ordinance and other ordinances, such as internal/external street connectivity, trail connectivity, utility requirements, emergency services access, and similar public need requirements, the benefit of that public requirement or need should be weighed with retaining the stream buffer.
1) A Right-of-way or trail easement crosses a stream buffer, should be the minimum width needed to allow for maintenance access and installation.
2) For a Right-of-way or trail easement the angle of the crossing shall be perpendicular to the stream to minimize clearing requirements.

Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to this subsection, the Engineering Services and Community Development shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking standards on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant.
Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by Engineering Services and Community Development, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use.
Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.
The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
2) In approving a parking requirement for a proposed use that is less than identified in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3, sufficient area shall be reserved in accordance with Subsection 6.5.11.D to allow for adequate parking to be installed upon a change in use or increased parking demand over time.
E. Mixed Uses.
Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one use shall provide parking spaces in an amount equal to the total of the standards for all individual uses.
This provision shall not limit the ability to submit an Alternative Parking Plan to reduce the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces in recognition of different operating hours or peak business periods.
F. Maximum Number of Spaces Permitted.
In no event shall an attached residential, nonresidential, or mixed-use development provide more than 120 percent of the minimum number of parking spaces established in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, as surface spaces except through the approval of an Alternative Parking Plan.
(See Subsection 6.5.11.)
1) Additional Requirements   a) Any off-street surface parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum number of off-street parking spaces required in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, shall comply with the standards of Subsection 6.5.11.A, Provision over the Maximum Allowed.
b) Off-street surface parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum number of spaces shall be pervious.
G. Compact Spaces.
Within lots of 20 or more spaces, up to 25 percent of the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces identified in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, may be provided as compact car spaces, provided the following standards are met:   1) Minimum Dimensions   a) Each compact car parking space shall have minimum dimensions in accordance with Figure 6-72, Dimensional Standards for Parking Spaces and Aisles;   b) The minimum width of compact spaces shall be increased to eight feet and seven inches for spaces at a 60 degree angle to the aisle serving them, and ten feet and six inches for spaces at a 45 degree angle to aisle serving them;   2) Location.
Compact car parking spaces shall be located no closer to the primary building entrance than any standard parking spaces; and   3) Designated.
All compact car spaces shall be designated by signage or pavement marking.

B.
Different Use Areas.
Except as provided for in this subsection, parking shall be calculated separately for each different use area in a building or on a site, including all accessory uses.
C. Combinations of Uses.
If the Engineering Services and Community Development determines that a proposed use represents a combination of uses listed in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, the minimum and maximum parking space standards shall be those that would apply if the two (or more) uses were developed separately, unless the Engineering Services and Community Development determines that a lower standard would be adequate because of differences in peak operating hours.
D. On-Street Parking and Other Public Parking.
Except on detached residential lots, Traditional Zones, mixed-use developments, Conservation Subdivisions, PUD’s, or as part of an Alternative Parking Plan, on-street parking on streets and other public parking spaces shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards of this subsection.
Except for the DWTN District, those areas and development types that do allow on-street and other public parking spaces to count towards required off-street parking requirements, said spaces must be within 250 feet of the use requiring the parking.
E. Determination by Engineering Services and Community Development  1) Parking standards for uses not specifically listed in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, shall be determined by the Engineering Services and Community Development based on the standards for the closest comparable use or by reference to standard parking resources published by the National Parking Association or the American Planning Association.
2) The Engineering Services and Community Development may alternately require the submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand based on the recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.
F. Certain Downtown Areas Exempt.
Some areas in the Downtown district shall be exempt from minimum parking requirements., if all the following conditions are met: 1) No on-site improvements are proposed or required.
On-site improvements would include buildings, building expansion, and on/off-street parking.
2) The establishment requires fewer than 80 parking spaces.
3) Location: a) is located within the area bounded by Hobbs Street to the north, Madison Street to the west, Green Street to the south, and Beaty Street to the east (generally the area defined as Downtown by the 2013 Future Land Use Plan on page 57, Figure 18.

§6.8.
Mobility and Circulation 6.8.1.
Purpose and Intent.
The purpose for this section is to establish mobility and circulation standards that treat alternative modes of travel (including walking) with the same degree of importance as that afforded to motor vehicles.
This section is intended to:   A.
Provide safe, efficient, and convenient vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access and circulation patterns within and between developments;   B.
Foster a pedestrian-friendly distribution of land uses and street network;   C. Create a safe, continuous network of pedestrian walkways within and between developments;   D. Reduce interference with through traffic by other vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians entering, leaving, and crossing streets;   E. Establish a pedestrian network that offers clear circulation paths from the parking areas to building entries that creates a friendlier, more inviting image;   F. Assure safe access to and from streets by emergency vehicles; and   G. Establish a requirement for the preparation of a Circulation Plan that addresses transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and vehicular circulation both within a development and with surrounding developments.
6.8.2.
Applicability.
The standards in this section shall apply to development on all lots in the city, as well as to public and private street rights-of-way.
6.8.3.
Development Standards for Sidewalks.
All sidewalks and pedestrian pathways within a development shall be ADA compliant and meet the standard specifications for construction adopted by the City.
6.8.4.
Circulation Plan Required   A.
Applicants for a developmental subdivision and large scale developments shall prepare a Circulation Plan.
B.
The Circulation Plan shall address street connectivity, emergency and service vehicle access, parking movements, accommodation of loading operations, turning radii, traffic calming measures where future “cut-through” traffic is likely, and similar issues.
C. The DRT may waive the requirement for a Circulation Plan on a case-by-case basis in the event that a new development has no impact upon circulation or proposes no change in existing circulation patterns.
This provision shall not be construed to exempt development that includes additional parking, driveways, or substantial modifications to the existing pedestrian network.
D. A Circulation Plan shall be submitted with the Concept Plan, Preliminary Plat, Final Plat, Site Plan, or Development Plan.
E. Traffic Impact Analysis.
As a part of the required Circulation Plan, the City Engineer may require, at no cost to the city, a traffic impact study to be prepared in accordance with the standards set in the Athens Traffic Circulation Standards.
6.8.5.
Connectivity   A.
Internal Street Connectivity   1) Circulation Plans for development on lots in the Traditional Zone shall provide for multiple connections to the existing city street network wherever possible.
2) Except for lots within the Traditional Zone, Circulation Plans prepared for all new development shall maintain internal street connectivity through the use of a connectivity index, in accordance with the following standards:   a) All development shall achieve a connectivity index score of 1.65 or greater;  b) The connectivity index for a development is calculated by dividing its links by its nodes.
Nodes (stars) exist at street intersections and cul-de-sac heads within the development.
Links (circles) are stretches of road that connect nodes.
Street stub-outs are considered as links, but temporary dead-end streets internal to a development, private streets in gated sections, or alleys shall not be counted as links.
One link beyond every node that exists in the development and provides access to the street network shall be included in the index calculation.
Figure 6-75: This figure provides an example of how to calculate the connectivity index.
In the diagram, there are 36 links (circles) and 21 nodes (stars); therefore the connectivity index is 1.71 (36/21 = 1.71).
In addition, each side of the development includes at least one street stub or connection to the greater street system every 1,500 feet.
c) The connectivity index standard of 1.65 or greater may be reduced by the DRT if the owner/developer demonstrates it is impossible or impracticable to achieve due to topographic conditions, natural features, or adjacent existing development patterns.
If an applicant disagrees with the decision of the DRT, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission or the Council (depending upon the type of application).
d) Whenever cul-de-sac streets are created, at least one eight-foot-wide pedestrian access/public utility easement shall be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, between each cul-de-sac head or street turnaround and the sidewalk system of the closest adjacent street or pedestrian sidewalk or pathway.
e) Temporary dead end streets terminating at the perimeter of a development shall be counted as a link.
In no case shall a temporary dead end street terminating at a point internal to the development be counted as a link.
3) Gated Streets.
Gated streets, or sections of neighborhoods with gated private streets, are permitted provided the development achieves and maintains the minimum connectivity index score in Subsection (2) above.
Private streets are to be built to City standards and inspected prior to final approval.
Figure 6-76: Pedestrian accessways from cul-de-sac heads to the larger pedestrian system help preserve pedestrian connectivity where street connections cannot be made.
B.
External Street Connectivity.
In addition to the internal street connectivity requirements, Circulation Plans for all new development, except for lots within the Traditional Zone, shall maintain external street connectivity in accordance with the following standards:   1) The arrangement of streets in a development shall provide for the alignment and continuation of existing or proposed streets into adjoining lands in those cases in which the (a) adjoining lands are undeveloped and intended for future development or (b) in which the adjoining lands are developed and include opportunities for such connections, unless it is determined that the public benefit to be achieved by the new development’s external street connectivity and the city’s overall policy objectives favoring connectivity are significantly outweighed by (i) the undesireable negative impacts on traffic and/or safety, (ii) the reasonable opposition of owners/residents of the new development and the adjoining lands, (iii) or the strong likelihood of the use of minor streets for through streets.
Where external street connectivity is required, traffic calming measures shall be integrated into the development to mitigate the impact of potential future “cut-through” traffic.
2) Street rights-of-way shall be extended to or along adjoining property boundaries such that a roadway connection or street stub shall be provided for development at least every 1,500 feet for each direction (north, south, east, and west) in which development abuts vacant lands.
Such street stubs shall not be required to abut adjacent development lacking existing or planned street connections, floodplains, wetlands, riparian buffers, slopes exceeding 14 percent, other unique site conditions preventing a street connection with the determination of the DRT, or in situations where external connectivity is not required by subsection 6.6.5.B.1.
3) Residential streets affected by external street connectivity requirements may be candidates for traffic calming treatments upon the recommendation of the Engineering Department.
If an applicant disagrees with the decision of the Engineering Department regarding traffic calming, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission or Council, depending on the type of application.
4) Street and sidewalk connections shall be made between neighborhood commercial centers and adjacent residential neighborhoods.
5) Shared commercial/residential connections with arterials shall be primarily oriented towards commercial centers.
6) At all locations where streets terminate with no street connection, but a future connection is planned or accommodated, a sign shall be installed by the City at the developer’s expense at the temporary street stub with the words “STREET TO BE EXTENDED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF ATHENS” to inform property owners.
7) The Final Subdivision Plat and the deeds for all residential dwellings shall identify all stub streets and include a notation that all street stubs are intended for connection with future streets on adjoining undeveloped property.

2019-2079, § 7 adopted 2019-04-22)  C. Cross Access Between Adjacent Uses.
To encourage shared parking and shared access points on public streets, circulation plans prepared for all new attached residential, nonresidential, and mixed-use development shall comply with the following standards:   1) Except on lots within the M-1 and M-2 Districts, internal vehicular circulation areas shall be designed to allow for cross-access to adjacent lots with attached residential, nonresidential, or mixed-uses.
2) A stub for future cross access shall be provided from the vehicular use area to all adjacent vacant land designated for attached residential, nonresidential, or mixed-uses.
3) A minimum distance of 40 feet shall be required between a cross-access way and driveway entrance apron.
4) Cross-access ways shall allow for two-way traffic between parcels through the use of a single drive aisle with a minimum width of 22 feet or through two one-way aisles each with a minimum width of 11 feet.
The maximum median separation width shall be 15 feet with a left-turn pocket or four feet without a left-turn pocket.
5) When cross-access is determined to be impractical by the DRT on the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular safety factors, the requirement for cross-access may be waived if appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses.
If an applicant disagrees with the determination of the DRT, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission or Council, depending on the type of application.
6) A cross-access easement must be recorded prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the development.
Figure 6-77: Cross-access ways between surface parking lots serving different developments promote better access management and facilitate pedestrian activity.
6.8.6.
Block Standards.
Circulation plans associated with developments of two or more lots shall comply with the standards in the Subdivision Regulations, as well as the following block standards:   A.
Block Length.
Except for areas that contain steep slopes, the average block length in a development shall not exceed 600 linear feet between the right-of-way edges of intersecting streets.
Except in cases where environmental or topographic constraints exist or the property has an irregular shape, no individual block shall exceed a maximum length of 800 linear feet.
B.
Block Width.
To the maximum extent practicable, the width of any block shall be sufficient to permit at least two tiers of lots of appropriate depth for the base district exclusive of any public alleys, watercourses, or other rights-of-way located outside platted lots.
This standard shall not apply to areas that contain steep slopes where it is more desirable to reduce environmental impacts.
C. Internal Mid-Block Pedestrian Access.
In cases where a block length exceeds 600 feet, sidewalks in easements or on open space lots shall be provided mid-block internally to connect parallel streets on the long side of the block.
Figure 6-78: Mid-block pedestrian accessways help maintain pedestrian access within long blocks.

Streets designated as arterial in the Transportation Plan of the City of Athens (ATP) shall be considered to be arterial streets.
2) Collector Streets.
Streets designated as collector on the ATP, shall be considered to be collector streets.
3) Local Streets.
All other streets formally accepted for perpetual maintenance by the city and not designated as an arterial or a collector street, shall be considered to be local streets.
B.
Street Design   1) Public street design shall conform to the arrangement, width, and location standards specified in the Athens Transportation and Street Technical Standards.
2) In instances where a new street is not indicated on the ATP, it should support a rectangular grid or modified grid street network to the maximum extent practicable.
Curvilinear street networks should only be used when:   a) Topographic or environmental constraints make use of the grid pattern undesirable;   b) Established development patterns on adjacent lands make the grid pattern infeasible; or   c) Used in conjunction with a grid pattern to limit exceptionally long vistas exceeding 1,200 feet down straight streets.
C. Private Streets.
Private streets shall be built to the same standards as required for public streets.
D. Arterial and Collector Street Location.
If an arterial or collector street is located within or adjacent to a development, the development shall continue the street to a logical termination point.
E. Maximum Street Width   1) Street widths shall be kept to a minimum while still allowing for cars to move safely in order to calm traffic, reduce the street-crossing distance for pedestrians, minimize stormwater runoff created by excessive impervious areas, and minimize taxpayer costs for maintaining unnecessary paved surfaces.
Figure 6-79: Narrow streets are more attractive to pedestrians, reduce stormwater runoff, and minimize maintenance costs.
F. Striping.
All streets within public rights-of-way shall use thermoplastic materials for lane striping.
G. Poles, Bridges, and Barriers   1) Traffic poles, whether provided by the city or developer should be black or dark green in color.

d) Except as provided by subsection (c), alleys shall terminate at a public street or at a turnaround, preferably hammerhead style (“T” or “L”), and be of sufficient dimensions to accommodate garbage trucks.
In cases where the main access is provided by alley—reverse frontage—or in the opinion of the DRT that a turnaround could impact emergency response, the turnaround must be of sufficient dimension to accommodate the largest fire apparatus.
Cul-de-sac style turnarounds for an alley are discouraged.
e) Alleys shall not be included within the connectivity index calculation.
(See Subsection 6.6.4, Connectivity.)
f) Structures shall be labeled with the street name and house number along the alley.
g) Garbage and utility service shall be served from alleys in developments where alleys are located; however, water utilities may be served from the front of the structure.
h) Garbage cans shall be placed on 2-foot by 2-foot concrete pads located on each lot.
i) No vehicle, fence, structure, vegetation, or wall shall be erected, maintained, or planted within the alley right-of-way or within two feet of the edge of the alley’s pavement/curb, whichever is greater.
j) Mailboxes shall be:   (i) Either be located in the alley, or in mailbox gangs adjacent to the alley; and   (ii) Located at least two feet from the concrete pads so as to avoid conflicts with garbage collection.

F. Sidewalk Fund Option  1) On any occasion where § 6.6.14(A)-(E) is made applicable to a site through the operation of this Ordinance such that the installation of a new sidewalk is required at a site, the property owner or applicant with respect to that site may, if allowed by the Zoning Official, pay eighty percent (80%) of the estimated cost, labor and materials, of the new sidewalk into the City’s Sidewalk Fund, instead of installing the new sidewalk (the “Sidewalk Fund Option”).
2) The Zoning Official will allow the Sidewalk Fund Option to be available for a site if the Zoning Official determines, his his/her reasonable discretion, that there is little or no likelihood that the new sidewalk at the property site will be joined and connected to other sidewalks in the foreseeable future in a manner such that the purposes set forth in § 6.6.1 are effectively served.
3) The City’s Sidewalk Fund will be a fund maintained by the City Clerk/Treasurer for the purpose of providing funding for sidewalk construction, repair, and maintenance, and all or portions of the same may be expended for that purpose from time to time as directed by the City.
4) The Zoning Official shall establish the estimated cost, labor and materials, of the new sidewalk for purposes of the Sidewalk Fund Option, and in doing so, may consider the costs expended by the City with respect to sidewalk construction as well as any reasonable estimates provided by the owner or applicant with respect to the same.
5) If an owner or applicant utilizes the Sidewalk Fund Option, then that fact shall be noted on any development plan that would have otherwise shown the requirement of the installation of a new sidewalk for that same occasion pursuant to § 6.6.14(A-E).
6) An owner or applicant’s use of the Sidewalk Fund Option on any one occasion at a site shall not prevent the future application of § 6.6.14(A-E) on a later occasion at the same site where different circumstances, work, use, or development would otherwise require compliance with § 6.6.14(A-E) such that the installation of a new sidewalk is required at that site.
Likewise, an owner or applicant’s use of the Sidewalk Fund Option on any one occasion at a site shall not prevent a subsequent use of the Sidewalk Fund Option at the same site at a later time.
