# These permitted used were derived from the International Zoning Code 2021.
# Specifically ยง401.1, ยง501.1, ยง601.1, & ยง701.1.
# International Code Council is the copyright owner of the document.
# This was created and used in an educational context for a class.


##### Custom Unit ########
# The IZC has three custom units: Dwelling units per acre, acres per dwelling units, and units per acre.
# I would like to denote these by [du/acr_us], [acr_us/du], and [u/acr_us].
# These are units are upper bounds for the density of dwelling units in an area.

# Per the The Unified Code for Units of Measure (Sections 2 & Section 3) - https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum
# There are two ways to treat this unit as an arbitrary unit or a special unit.
# * Arbitrary units are considered dimensionless and should not be converted.
# * Special units are customary units and are enclosed with square brackets [].
# * Curly braces {} enclose annotation.
#
# Using this notation for the moment...
#      :maxDensity        "4 [du/acr_us]"^^cdt:dimensionless ;
#

# Notes about creating a custom unit: https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/lindt/


# ISSUES:
# * Permitted uses have some repetition.
# * Using :seeAlso to link residential :ZoningDistrictDivision needs a property that links it back to its :ZoningDistrict
#     Not sure if this really gets at the proper relationship.
